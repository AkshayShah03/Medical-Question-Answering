       "{'Abdominal aortic aneurysm': 'an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta – the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart, down through the abdomen to the rest of the body.the abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide – roughly the width of a garden hose. however, it can swell to over 5.5cm – what doctors class as a large aaa.large aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. if a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal.the bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm.aaas are most common in men aged over 65. a rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group.this is why all men are invited for ascreening testwhen they turn 65. the test involves a simpleultrasound scan, which takes around 10-15 minutes.in most cases, an aaa causes no noticeable symptoms. however, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain.an aaa doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there’s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture).a ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don’t survive surgery.the most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen.if you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.read more about thesymptoms of an aaa.it’s not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.there are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level.having a family history of aortic aneurysms also means that you have an increased risk of developing one yourself.read more about thecauses of an aaa.because aaas usually cause no symptoms, they tend to be diagnosed either as a result of screening or during a routine examination – for example, if a gp notices a pulsating sensation in your abdomen.the screening test is anultrasound scan, which allows the size of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. this is also how an aneurysm will be diagnosed if your doctor suspects you have one.read more aboutdiagnosing an aaa.if a large aaa is detected before it ruptures, most people will be advised to have treatment, to prevent it rupturing.this is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing.if surgery is not advisable – or if you decide not to have it – there are a number of non-surgical treatments that can reduce the risk of an aneurysm rupturing.they include medications to lower your cholesterol andblood pressure, andquitting smoking.you will also have the size of your aneurysm checked regularly with ultrasound scanning.read more abouttreating aaas.the best way to prevent getting an aneurysm – or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing – is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels, such as: smoking eating a high-fat diet not exercising regularly being overweight or obeseread more aboutpreventing aneurysms.read more aboutscreening for an aaa.in most cases, an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) will cause no symptoms, unless it becomes particularly large.symptoms of an unruptured aaa may include: a pulsating feeling in your stomach (abdomen), usually near your belly button, that’s usually only noticeable when you touch it persistent back pain persistent abdominal painif you have any of the symptoms above, you should see your gp as soon as possible.if your aortic aneurysm ruptures, you will feel a sudden and severe pain in the middle or side of your abdomen. in men, the pain can also radiate down into the scrotum.other symptoms include: dizziness sweaty and clammy skin rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) shortness of breath feeling faint loss of consciousnessa ruptured aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency, and it’s important to get to hospital as soon as possible.around 80% of people with a rupture die before they reach hospital or don’t survive emergency surgery.this is why thenhs aaa screening programmewas introduced, so dangerously large aneurysms can be treated before they burst.if you suspect that you or someone in your care has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.the aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. it transports oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) occurs when part of the aorta wall becomes weakened and the large amount of blood that passes through it puts pressure on the weak spot, causing it to bulge outwards to form an aneurysm.the abdominal aorta is usually around 2cm wide – about the width of a garden hosepipe  – but can swell to over 5.5cm, which is what doctors classify as a large aneurysm.it’s not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.one study found that people aged over 75 are seven times more likely to be diagnosed with an aaa than people under 55 years old.men are around six times more likely to be diagnosed with an aaa than women.however, there are other risk factors that you can do something about – described below – the most important of which is smoking.research has found that smokers are seven times more likely to develop an aaa than people who have never smoked.the more you smoke, the greater your risk of developing an aaa. people who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers.the risk may increase because tobacco smoke contains harmful substances that can damage and weaken the wall of the aorta.atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged up by fatty deposits, such as cholesterol.an aaa is thought to develop because these deposits (called plaques) cause the aorta to widen in an attempt to keep blood flowing through it. as it widens, it also gets weaker.smoking, eating a high-fat diet and high blood pressure all increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis.as well as contributing to atherosclerosis,high blood pressure (hypertension)can place increased pressure on the aorta’s wall.having a family history of aaas means that you have an increased risk of developing one.one study found that people who had a brother or sister with an aaa were eight times more likely to develop one than people whose siblings were unaffected.this suggests that certain genes you inherit from your parents may make you more vulnerable to developing an aaa.however, no specific genes have yet been identified.read about how toreduce your risk of developing an aaa.an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) usually causes no symptoms. therefore, they tend to be diagnosed as a result of screening, or during a routine physical examination when a gp notices a distinctive pulsating sensation in your abdomen.a diagnosis can be confirmed using an ultrasound scan. ultrasound can also determine the size of the aneurysm, which is an important factor in deciding on a course of treatment.all men in the uk who are 65 or over are offered anultrasound scanto check for aaas.all men should receive an invitation in the year they turn 65 years old. men who are older than 65 can refer themselves for screening by contacting theirlocal nhs aaa screening service.for more information, visit our page onaaa screening.treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) depends on several factors, including the aneurysm’s size, your age and general health.in general, if you have a large aneurysm (5.5cm or larger) you will be advised to have surgery, either to strengthen the swollen section of the aorta or to replace it with a piece of synthetic tubing.this is because the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is usually greater than the risk of having it repaired.if you have a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you will be offered regular scans to check its size.you will also be given advice on how to slow its growth and reduce the risk of it rupturing – for example, stopping smoking – and perhaps medications to reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol level.if you are diagnosed with an aaa that is 5.5cm or larger, you will be referred to a vascular surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in diseases of the blood vessels), who may recommend an operation.the surgeon will discuss treatment options with you, taking into account your general health and fitness, as well as the size of your aneurysm.if it’s decided that surgery isn’t suitable for you, it’s still possible to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting, and you will have regular scans to check its size – in the same way people with small or medium aneurysms are treated.see below for more information on treating small and medium aneurysms.there are two surgical techniques used to treat a large aneurysm: endovascular surgery open surgeryalthough both techniques are equally effective at reducing the risk of the aneurysm bursting, each has its own advantages and disadvantages.the surgeon will discuss with you which is most suitable.endovascular surgery is a type of “keyhole” surgery where the surgeon makes small cuts in your groin.a small piece of tubing called a graft– made of metal mesh lined with fabric – is then guided up through the leg artery, into the swollen section of aorta, and sealed to the wall of the aorta at both ends.this reinforces the aorta, reducing the risk of it bursting.this is the safest of the two types of surgery available. around 98-99% of patients make a full recovery, and recovery time from the operation is shorter than if you have open surgery.there are also fewer major complications, such as wound infection or deep vein thrombosis (dvt).however, the way the graft is attached is not as secure as open surgery. you’ll need regular scans to make sure the graft hasn’t slipped, and in some patients, the seal at each end of the graft starts to leak and will need to be resealed. you will need to have surgery again if either of these occurs.in open surgery, the surgeon cuts into your stomach (abdomen) to reach the abdominal aorta and replaces the enlarged section with a graft.this type of graft is a tube made of a synthetic material.because the graft is stitched (sutured) into place by the surgeon, it’s more likely to stay in place, and will usually work well for the rest of your life.the risk of complications linked to the graft after surgery is lower than in people who have endovascular surgery.open surgery isn’t usually recommended for people who are in poor health as it is a major operation. it is slightly more risky than endovascular surgery, with 93-97% of patients making a full recovery.the main risk of open surgery is death or heart attack, and recovery time is longer than with endovascular surgery.there is also a greater risk of complications, such as wound infection, chest infection and dvt.if you are diagnosed with a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you won’t be referred to see a vascular surgeon, as it’s unlikely you’d benefit from surgery.you’ll be invited back for regular scans to check the size of the aneurysm, in case it gets bigger – every year if you have a small aneurysm and every three months if you have a medium aneurysm.you will also be given advice on how to prevent the aneurysm from getting bigger, including: stopping smoking eating a balanced diet ensuring you maintain a healthy weight taking regular exerciseif you smoke, the most important change you can make is to quit. aneurysms have been shown to grow faster in smokers than in non-smokers.read more aboutstopping smokingandnicotine replacement therapies (nrts)that can make it easier to stop smoking.your gp will be sent your test result and may decide to change your current medication or start you on a new one, especially if you have: high blood pressure– which you will probably be treated for with a medication called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor high cholesterol – which you will probably be treated for with a medication called astatinemergency treatment for a ruptured aaa is based on the same principle as preventative treatment. grafts are used to repair the ruptured aneurysm.the decision on whether to perform open or endovascular surgery is made on a case-by-case basis by the surgeon carrying out the operation.the best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels.this includes: smoking eating a high-fat diet not exercising regularly being overweight or obeseif your gp finds out you have high blood pressure or a high cholesterol level, you may be prescribed medication for both. this will reduce the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa).smoking is a major risk factor for aneurysms because it causes atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and raises your blood pressure.tobacco smoke contains substances that can damage the walls of the arteries.it is known that smokers are seven times more likely than non-smokers to develop an aaa.the more you smoke, the greater your risk. people who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers.if you want to stop smoking, your gp will be able to refer you to an nhs stop smoking service, which will give you dedicated help and advice about the best ways to quit.you can also call or chat online withquit your way scotland. the specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement.read more aboutstopping smokingandnicotine replacement therapies (nrts), which can make it easier to quit.eating a high-fat diet increases your risk of atherosclerosis.it’s especially important to limit the amount of foods you eat that are high in saturated fat, such as biscuits, cakes, butter, sausages and bacon.this is because eating too much saturated fat can lead to high cholesterol, which can build up in the artery walls.read more abouthigh cholesterol. find out more abouthealthy eatingand how toreduce the amount of saturated fat you eat.being active and doing regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.regular exercise can also help you lose weight, which will also help lower your blood pressure.adults should do at least 150 minutes (two hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week.examples of moderate intensity activity include cycling or fast walking.for it to count, the

       " 'Acne': 'acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. it causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that’s hot or painful to touch.acne most commonly develops on the: face – this affects almost everyone with acne back – this affects more than half of people with acne chest – this affects about 15% of people with acnethere are 6 main types of spot caused by acne: blackheads – small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they’re not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring) whiteheads – have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and won’t empty when squeezed papules – small red bumps that may feel tender or sore pustules – similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus nodules – large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful cysts – the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they’re large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarringthe self-help techniques below may be useful: don’t wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. very hot or cold water can make acne worse don’t try to “clean out” blackheads or squeeze spots. this can make them worse and cause permanent scarring avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin) completely remove make-up before going to bed if dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient regular exercise can’t improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your facealthough acne can’t be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available at pharmacies. if you develop acne, it’s a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice.treatments can take up to 3 months to work, so don’t expect results overnight. once they do start to work, the results are usually good.if you have acne you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. find your local pharmacy on scotland’s service directory.acne isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. if your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated withantibioticsor stronger creams that are only available on prescription. your pharmacist can advise on whether you need to see your gp for further treatment.if you develop nodules or cysts, they need to be treated properly through your gp to avoid scarring. try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring.acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age.certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).this abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called p. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.the hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). cleaning the skin doesn’t help to remove this blockage.acne is known to run in families. if both your mother and father had acne, it’s likely that you’ll also have acne.hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.there’s no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.read more about thecauses of acne, including some common acne myths.acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. about 80% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne.acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19.most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties.in some cases, acne can continue into adult life. about 5% of women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25.you can find support and information from organisations like: changing faces– a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and adviceacne is caused when tiny holes in the skin, known as hair follicles, become blocked.sebaceous glands are tiny glands found near the surface of your skin. the glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of.sebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. they do this by producing an oily substance called sebum.in acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. the excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle.if the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead.normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts.teenage acne is thought to be triggered by increased levels of a hormone called testosterone, which occurs during puberty. the hormone plays an important role in stimulating the growth and development of the penis and testicles in boys, and maintaining muscle and bone strength in girls.the sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to hormones. it’s thought that increased levels of testosterone cause the glands to produce much more sebum than the skin needs.acne can run in families. if your parents had acne, it’s likely that you’ll also develop it.one study has found that if both your parents had acne, you’re more likely to get more severe acne at an early age. it also found that if one or both of your parents had adult acne, you’re more likely to get adult acne too.more than 80% of cases of adult acne occur in women. it’s thought that many cases of adult acne are caused by the changes in hormone levels that many women have at certain times.these times include: periods – some women have a flare-up of acne just before their period pregnancy– many women have symptoms of acne at this time, usually during the first 3 months of their pregnancy polycystic ovary syndrome– a common condition that can cause acne, weight gain and the formation of small cysts inside the ovaryother possible triggers of an acne flare-up include: some cosmetic products – however, this is less common as most products are now tested, so they don’t cause spots (non-comedogenic) certain medications – such assteroid medications, lithium (used to treatdepressionandbipolar disorder) and some anti-epileptic drugs (used to treatepilepsy) regularly wearing items that place pressure on an affected area of skin, such as a headband or backpack smoking– which can contribute to acne in older peopledespite being one of the most widespread skin conditions, acne is also one of the most poorly understood. there are many myths and misconceptions about it:so far, research hasn’t found any foods that cause acne. eating a healthy, balanced diet is recommended because it’s good for your heart and your health in general.most of the biological reactions that trigger acne occur beneath the skin, not on the surface, so the cleanliness of your skin has no effect on your acne. washing your face more than twice a day could just aggravate your skin.this could actually make symptoms worse and may leave you with scarring.having sex or masturbating won’t make acne any better or worse.there’s no conclusive evidence that prolonged exposure to sunlight or using sunbeds or sunlamps can improve acne. many medications used to treat acne can make your skin more sensitive to light, so exposure could cause painful damage to your skin, and also increase your risk of skin cancer.you can’t pass acne on to other people.your pharmacist can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. this involves examining your face and possibly your chest and back for different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules.how many spots you have and how painful and inflamed they are will help determine how severe your acne is. this is important in planning your treatment.4 grades can be used to measure the severity of acne: grade 1 (mild) – acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules grade 2 (moderate) – there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face grade 3 (moderately severe) – there’s a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne grade 4 (severe) – there’s a large number of large, painful pustules and nodulesif acne suddenly starts in adult women, it can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, especially if it’s accompanied by other symptoms such as: excessive body hair (hirsutism) irregular or light periodsthe most common cause of hormonal imbalances in women is polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). pcos can be diagnosed using a combination ofultrasound scansandblood tests.treatment for acne depends on how severe it is. it can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve.the various treatments for acne are outlined below.if you just have a few blackheads, whiteheads and spots, you should be able to treat them successfully with over-the-counter gels or creams (topical treatments) that contain benzoyl peroxide.see your gp if your acne is more widespread, as you probably need prescription medication. for example, if: you have a large number of papules and pustules over-the-counter medication hasn’t workedprescription medications that can be used to treat acne include: topical retinoids topicalantibiotics azelaic acid antibiotic tablets in women, thecombined oral contraceptive pill isotretinoin tabletsif you have severe acne, your gp can refer you to an expert in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). for example, if you have: a large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back, as well as your face painful nodulesa combination of antibiotic tablets and topical treatments is usually the first treatment option for severe acne. if this doesn’t work, a medication called isotretinoin may be prescribed.hormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. however, theprogestogen-only pillorcontraceptive implantcan sometimes make acne worse.many of these treatments can take 2 to 3 months before they start to work. it’s important to be patient and persist with a recommended treatment, even if there’s no immediate effect.benzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. it also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect.benzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. it’s used either once or twice a day. it should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne.it should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin. it also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (uv) light, or wear sun cream.benzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or clothes.common side effects of benzoyl peroxide include: dry and tense skin a burning, itching or stinging sensation some redness and peeling of the skinside effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished.most people need a 6 week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne. you may be advised to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning.topical retinoids work by removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating) which helps to prevent them building up within hair follicles.tretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. they’re available in a gel or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed.apply to all the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face.it’s important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and uv.topical retinoids aren’t suitable for use during pregnancy, as there’s a risk they might cause birth defects.the most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin.a 6 week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this.topical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles. they’re available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day.a 6 to 8 week course is usually recommended. after this, treatment is usually stopped, as there’s a risk that the bacteria on your face could become resistant to the antibiotics. this could make your acne worse and cause additional infections.side effects are uncommon, but can include: minor irritation of the skin redness and burning of the skin peeling of the skinazelaic acid is often used as an alternative treatment for acne if the side effects of benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids are particularly irritating or painful.azelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. it’s available as a cream or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive).the medication doesn’t make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you don’t have to avoid exposure to the sun.you’ll usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves.the side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include: burning or stinging skin itchiness dry skin redness of the skinantibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more severe acne.in most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.pregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use.it usually takes about 6 weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne.depending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last 4 to 6 months.tetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and uv light, and can also make the oral contraceptive pill less effective during the first few weeks of treatment.you’ll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such ascondoms, during this time.hormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around periods or is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.if you don’t already use it, your gp may recommend thecombined oral contraceptive pill, even if you’re not sexually active. this combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen.co-cyprindiol is a hormonal treatment that can be used for more severe acne that doesn’t respond to antibiotics. it helps to reduce the production of sebum.you’ll probably have to use co-cyprindiol for 2 to 6 months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne.there’s a small risk that women taking co-cyprindiol may developbreast cancerin later life.for example, out of a group of 10,000 women who haven’t taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast cancer by the time they were 35. this figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at least 5 years in their early twenties.there’s also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. the risk is estimated to be around 1 in 2,500 in any given year.it’s not thought to be safe to take co-cyprindiol if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. women may need to have a pregnancy test before treatment can begin.other side effects of co-cyprindiol include: bleeding and spotting between your periods, which can sometimes occur for the first few months headaches sore breasts mood changes loss of interest in sex weight gain or weight lossisotretinoin has a number of beneficial effects: it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is produced it helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged it decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin it reduces redness and swelling in and around spotshowever, the drug can also cause a wide range of side effects. it’s only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven’t responded to other treatments.because of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained gp or a dermatologist.isotretinoin is taken as a tablet. most people take a 4 to 6 month course. your acne may get worse during the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. however, this is normal and soon settles.common side effects of isotretinoin include: inflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils changes in your blood sugar levels inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) inflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis) blood in your urinerarer side effects of isotretinoin include: inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) kidney diseasebecause of the risk of these rarer side effects, you’ll need ablood testbefore and during treatment.isotretinoin will damage an unborn baby. if you’re a woman of childbearing age: don’t use isotretinoin if you’re pregnant or you think you’re pregnant use 1, or ideally 2, methods of contraception for 1 month before treatment begins, during treatment and for 1 month after treatment has finished have a pregnancy test before, during and after treatmentyou’ll be asked to sign a form confirming that you understand the risk of birth defects and are willing to use contraceptives to prevent this risk, even if you’re not currently sexually active.if you think you may have become pregnant when taking isotretinoin, contact your dermatologist immediately.isotretinoin is also not suitable if you’re breastfeeding.there have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking isotretinoin. there’s no evidence that these mood changes were the result of the medication.however, as a precaution, contact your doctor immediately if you feel depressed or anxious, have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts.several treatments for acne don’t involve medication.these include: comedone extractor – a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads chemical peels – where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it photodynamic therapy – where light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acnehowever, these treatments may not work and can’t be routinely recommended.acne scarring can sometimes develop as a complication of acne. any type of acne spot can lead to scarring, but it’s more common when the most serious types of spots (nodules and cysts) burst and damage nearby skin.scarring can also occur if you pick or squeeze your spots, so it’s important not to do this.there are 3 main types of acne scars: ice pick scars – small, deep holes in the surface of your skin that look like the skin has been punctured with a sharp object rolling scars – caused by bands of scar tissue that form under the skin, giving the surface of the skin a rolling and uneven appearance boxcar scars – round or oval depressions, or craters, in the skintreatments for acne scarring are regarded as a type of cosmetic surgery, which isn’t usually available on the nhs. however, in the past, exceptions have been made when it’s been shown that acne scarring has caused serious psychological distress.see your gp if you’re considering having cosmetic surgery. they’ll be able to discuss your options with you and advise you about the likelihood of having the procedure carried out on the nhs.many private clinics offer treatment for acne scarring. prices can vary widely (from £500 to more than £10,000) depending on the type of treatment needed.thebritish association of plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgeonswebsite has more information about private treatment available in your area.it’s important to have realistic expectations about what cosmetic treatment can achieve. while treatment can certainly improve the appearance of your scars, it can’t get rid of them completely.after treatment for acne scarring, most people notice a 50-75% improvement in their appearance.some of the available treatments for acne scarring are explained below.dermabrasion involves removing the top layer of skin, either using lasers or a specially made wire brush.after the procedure, your skin will look red and sore for several months, but as it heals you should notice an improvement in the appearance of your scars.laser treatment can be used to treat mild to moderate acne scarring. there are 2 types of laser treatment: ablative laser treatment – where lasers are used to remove a small patch of skin around the scar to produce a new, smooth-looking area of skin non-ablative laser treatment – where lasers are used to stimulate the growth of new collagen (a type of protein found in skin), which helps to repair some of the damage caused by scarring, and improves the appearancepunch techniques are used to treat ice pick scars and boxcar scars. there are 3 types of punch technique: punch excision – used to treat mild ice pick scars. the scar is surgically removed and the remaining wound is sealed. after the wound heals, it leaves a smoother and more even area of skin. punch elevation – used to treat boxcar scars. the base of the scar is surgically removed, leaving the sides of the scar in place. the base is then reattached to the sides, but lifted up so it’s level with the surface of the skin. this makes the scar much less noticeable. punch grafting – used to treat very deep ice pick scars. as with a punch excision, the scar is removed, but the wound is “plugged” with a sample of skin taken from elsewhere on the body (usually from the back of the ear).subcision is a surgical treatment that can be used to treat rolling scars. during surgery, the upper layer of the skin is removed from the underlying scar tissue. this allows blood to pool under the affected area. the blood clot helps form connective tissue, which pushes up the rolling scar so it’s level with the rest of the surface of the skin.once subscision has been completed, additional treatment, such as laser treatment and dermabrasion, can be used to further improve the appearance of the scar.acne can often cause intense feelings of anxiety and stress, which can sometimes make people with the condition become socially withdrawn. this combination of factors can lead to people with acne becomingdepressed.you may be depressed if during the last month you’ve often felt down, depressed or hopeless, and have little interest or pleasure in doing things.if you think that you or your child may have depression, it’s important to speak to your gp.treatments for depression include: talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) a type of antidepressant calledselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)read

       " 'Acute cholecystitis': 'acute cholecystitis is swelling (inflammation) of the gallbladder. it is a potentially serious condition that usually needs to be treated in hospital.the main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right side of your tummy (abdomen) that spreads towards your right shoulder.the affected part of the abdomen is usually extremely tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse.unlike some others types ofabdominal pain, the pain associated with acute cholecystitis is usually persistent, and doesn’t go away within a few hours.some people may additional symptoms, such as: you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if the pain lasts longer than a few hours or you have other symptoms, such as jaundice and a feverif your gp practice is closed, phone 111.it’s important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because there is a risk that serious complications could develop if the condition is not treated promptly.the causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis.calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. it accounts for around 95% of all cases.calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by agallstoneor by a substance known as biliary sludge.biliary sludge is a mixture of bile (a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats) and small crystals of cholesterol and salt.the blockage in the cystic duct results in a build-up of bile in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed. in around 1 in every 5 cases, the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria.acalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. it usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder.acalculous cholecystitis is often associated with problems such as accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries orburns,blood poisoning (sepsis), severemalnutritionoraids.acute cholecystitis is a relatively common complication of gallstones.it’s estimated that around 10% to 15% of adults in the uk have gallstones. these don’t usually cause any symptoms, but in a small proportion of people they can cause infrequent episodes of pain (known as biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis.to diagnose acute cholecystitis, your gp will examine your abdomen.they will probably carry out a simple test called murphy’s sign. you will be asked to breathe in deeply with your gp’s hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage.your gallbladder will move downwards as your breathe in and, if you have cholecystitis, you will experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor’s hand.if your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your gp will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment.tests you may have in hospital include: blood teststo check for signs of inflammation in your body anultrasound scanof your abdomen to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladderother scans – such as anx-ray, acomputerised tomography (ct) scanor amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– may also be carried out to examine your gallbladder in more detail if there is any uncertainty about your diagnosis.if you are diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you will probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.initial treatment will usually involve: fasting (not eating or drinking) to take the strain off your gallbladder receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to preventdehydration taking medication to relieve your painif you have a suspected infection, you will also be givenantibiotics. these often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital or you may be able to go home.with this initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused the condition usually fall back into the gallbladder and the inflammation often settles down.in order to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring, and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications, the removal of your gallbladder will often be recommended at some point after the initial treatment. this type of surgery is known as acholecystectomy.although uncommon, an alternative procedure called a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be carried out if you are too unwell to have surgery. this is where a needle is inserted through your abdomen to drain away the fluid that has built up in the gallbladder.if you are fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will need to decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder may be. in some cases, you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or 2, while in other cases you may be advised to wait for the inflammation to fully resolve over the next few weeks.surgery can be carried out in two main ways: laparoscopic cholecystectomy – a type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts (incisions) in your abdomen open cholecystectomy – where the gallbladder is removed through a single, larger incision in your abdomenalthough some people who have had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating anddiarrhoeaafter eating certain foods, you can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder.the organ can be useful but it’s not essential, as your liver will still produce bile to digest food.without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications.the main complications of acute cholecystitis are: the death of the tissue of the gallbladder, called gangrenous cholecystitis, which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body the gallbladder splitting open, known as a perforated gallbladder, which can spread the infection within your abdomen (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess)in about 1 in every 5 cases of acute cholecystitis, emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications.it’s not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by cutting your risk of gallstones.one of the main steps you can take to help lower your chances of developing gallstones is adopting a healthy, balanced diet and reducing the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones.being overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. you should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly.however, low-calorie, rapid weight loss diets should be avoided, because there is evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. a more gradual weight loss plan is best.read more aboutpreventing gallstones. gallstones high cholesterol self-help guide: abdominal pain nice: single-incision laparoscopic

       " 'Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia': 'leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. acute leukaemia means the condition progresses rapidly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment.acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected by cancer. there are 2 main types: lymphocytes, which are mostly used to fight viral infections neutrophils, which perform several functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damagethese pages focus on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is cancer of the lymphocytes. the following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia acute myeloid leukaemiasymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases. symptoms include: pale skin tiredness breathlessness having repeated infections over a short space of time unusual and frequent bleedingread more about thesymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaall of the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow – a spongy material found inside bones.bone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells: red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells, which help fight infection platelets, which help stop bleedingthe bone marrow usually produces stem cells which are allowed to fully develop before being released into the blood. but in acute leukaemia, bone marrow starts releasing large numbers of immature white blood cells known as blast cells.as the number of blast cells increases there is a drop in the number of red blood cells and platelet cells. this drop causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and increases the risk of excessive bleeding.also, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection.despite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children.the cause or causes of acute leukaemia are uncertain, but known risk factors include: exposure to high levels of radiation exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that is also found in cigarettesread more information about thecauses of acute lymphoblastic leukaemiasymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of blast cells (immature white blood cells) in your blood increases.most of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply.symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include: pale skin feeling tired and breathless having repeated infections over a short space of time unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above night sweats bone and joint pain easily bruised skin swollen lymph nodes (glands) abdominal pain – caused by a swollen liver or spleen unexplained weight loss a purple skin rash (purpura)in some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. this can cause a series of neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including: headaches seizures (fits) vomiting blurred vision dizzinessif you or your child has some or even all of these symptoms, it is still highly unlikely that acute leukaemia is the cause.however, see your gp as soon as possible because any condition that causes these symptoms needs to be promptly investigated and treated.acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by a dna mutation in the stem cells causing too many white blood cells to be produced.the white blood cells are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature and able to fight infection like fully developed white blood cells.as the number of immature cells increases, the number of healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it’s this fall which causes many of the symptoms of leukaemia.it is not known exactly what causes this dna mutation to occur, but there are a few factors which may increase the risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.a small number of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases are thought to be caused by related genetic disorders. for example, rates of leukaemia tend to be higher in children withdown’s syndrome.exposure to very high levels of radiation, either before birth or afterwards, is a known risk factor. however, it would require a significant level of radiation, such as the amount released during the nuclear reactor accident at chernobyl.due to the potential risk of radiation to unborn babies, medical techniques and equipment that use radiation, such asx-rays, are rarely used on pregnant women.most cases of childhood leukaemia occur in children with no history of genetic disorders or exposure to radiation.experts have also carried out extensive research to determine whether the following environmental factors could be a trigger for leukaemia: living near a nuclear power station living near a power line living near a building or facility that releases electromagnetic radiation, such as a mobile phone mastat the moment there is no evidence to confirm that any of these environmental factors increase the risk of developing leukaemia.exposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for adult acute leukaemia. benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry. however, there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.benzene is also found in cigarettes, which could explain why smokers are three times more likely to develop acute leukaemia than non-smokers. people who have hadchemotherapyandradiotherapyto treat earlier, unrelated cancers also have an increased risk of developing acute leukaemia.there is some evidence to show an increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in people who: areobese have a weakened immune system – due tohiv or aidsor taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplantthe first step in diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is for your gp to check for physical signs of the condition, such as swollen glands, and to take a blood sample.a high number of abnormal white blood cells in the blood sample could indicate the presence of acute leukaemia and you will then be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions).to confirm a diagnosis of acute leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope.the haematologist will use alocal anaestheticto numb the skin over a bone – usually the hip bone – and then use a needle to remove a sample of bone marrow. you may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. the procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight.the bone marrow will be checked for cancerous cells and – if found – the type of acute leukaemia will be determined at the same time.there are various additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. they can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated. these tests are described below.cytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. there are specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia, and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment.immunophenotyping is a test to help identify the exact type of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. a sample of blood, bone marrow or another type of fluid is studied.this testing is important as the treatment needed may be slightly different for each type.a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test can be done on a blood sample. this is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment.the blood test is repeated every three months for at least two years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved.if you have been diagnosed with acute leukaemia, further biopsies may be carried out on any enlarged lymph nodes that you have. these will be able to establish how far the leukaemia has spread.if you have acute leukaemia, acomputerised tomography scan (ct scan)may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy.anx-raymay be performed to examine the chest for any swollen lymph nodes.if it is felt that there is a risk that acute leukaemia has spread to your nervous system, alumbar puncturemay be carried out.a lumbar puncture is a test where a needle is used under local anaesthetic to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds and protects your spine) from your back. the fluid is tested to determine whether the leukaemia has reached your nervous system.treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begins a few days after diagnosis as it’s an aggressive condition that develops rapidly.treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is carried out in stages: induction – the aim of the initial stage of treatment is to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow, restore the balance of cells in your blood and resolve any symptoms you may have consolidation – this stage aims to kill any remaining leukaemia cells in your central nervous system maintenance – the final stage involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukaemia returningmaintenance only seems to be effective in treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; it’s not usually used in the treatment ofacute myeloid leukaemia.the induction stage of treatment is carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre. this is because you will probably need to have regularblood transfusionsas it’s likely that your blood will not contain enough healthy blood cells.you will also be vulnerable to infection, so it is important that you are in a sterile environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection that you have can be promptly treated. you may also be prescribedantibioticsto help prevent further infection.you will be givenchemotherapyto kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow. although some medications may be given as pills, you will need more than one medication given as an injection. to make things easier and avoid repeated injections, they can all be given via one flexible tube into a vein in your chest (called a central line).some chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. this is given using a needle that is placed into your spine, in a similar way to alumbar puncture.side effects that occur following chemotherapy are common. they can include: nausea vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes infertility hair lossthe side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. your hair will usually take between three to six months to grow back.you may also be givencorticosteroidinjections or tablets to help improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy.if you have a type of leukaemia known as philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, you will also be given a medicine called imatinib. imatinib works by blocking the signals in the cancerous cells that cause them to grow and reproduce. this kills the cancerous cells.imatinib is taken orally (as a tablet). the side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve over time. they include: nausea vomiting swelling in the face and lower legs muscle cramps rash diarrhoeadepending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from two weeks to several months. in some cases, you or your child may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve.leukaemia can return if just one cancerous cell remains in your body. therefore the aim of consolidation treatment is to ensure that any remaining leukaemia cells are killed.treatment involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication. this is usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. however, you may require some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection.the consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.the maintenance phase is designed to act as further insurance against the possibility of the leukaemia returning. it involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets while undergoing regular check-ups to monitor how effective your treatment is proving.the maintenance phase can often last for two years.as well as chemotherapy and imatinib, other treatments are used in some circumstances. these are described below.dasatinib is a new type of medication used to treat philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, when all other treatments have proved unsuccessful.dasatinib blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase that helps stimulate the growth of cancer cells.dasatinib cannot cure acute leukaemia but it can slow its growth, helping to relieve symptoms and prolong life.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has not yet made a decision about whether the nhs should provide treatment with dasatinib for people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. this means it will be at the discretion of your local clinical commissioning group as to whether you will be offered the drug.radiotherapyinvolves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. there are two main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat acute leukaemia: to sometimes treat advanced cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that have spread to the nervous system or brain to prepare the body for a bone marrow transplant (see below)side effects of both types of radiotherapy include: hair loss nausea fatiguethe side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed. however, your skin may be very sensitive to the effects of light for several months after the treatment has finished. if this is the case, avoid sunbathing or exposure to sources of artificial light, such as sunbeds, for several months.many younger children treated with radiotherapy will go on to have restricted physical growth during puberty.a small number of people develop cataracts several years after radiotherapy. cataracts are cloudy patches in the lens (the transparent structure at the front of the eye) that can make your vision blurred or misty. cataracts can usually be successfully treated using surgery.read more aboutcataractsif you or your child do not respond to chemotherapy, a possible alternative treatment option is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.transplantations are more successful if the donor has the same tissue type as you, so the ideal donor is usually a brother or sister.before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have aggressive high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body.this can put a big strain on the body so transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people who are in good health, and when there is a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister.read aboutbone marrow transplantationfor more informationbeing immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with acute leukaemia.there are 2 reasons for this: the lack of healthy white blood cells means that your immune system is less able to fight infection many of the medicines used to treat acute leukaemia can weaken the immune systemthis means that you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications.you may be advised to take regular doses ofantibioticsto prevent infections occurring. you should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your gp or care team because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications.symptoms of infection include: high temperature (fever) of 38c (101.4f) or above headache aching muscles diarrhoea tirednessavoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. this is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be lower.while it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour.also ensure that all of yourvaccinationsare up-to-date. your gp or care team will be able to advise you about this. you will be unable to have any vaccine containing activated particles of viruses of bacteria such as: the mumps, measles and rubella (mmr) vaccine the polio vaccine the oral typhoid vaccine the bcg vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis) the yellow fever vaccineif you have acute leukaemia, you will bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. bleeding may also be excessive when it does occur.bleeding can occur: inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage)the symptoms of an intracranial haemorrhage include: severe headache stiff neck vomiting change in mental state, such as confusionthe most common symptoms of a pulmonary haemorrhage are: coughing up blood from your nose and mouth breathing difficulties a bluish skin tone (cyanosis)the 2 most common symptoms of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage are: vomiting blood passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-likeall 3 types of haemorrhages should be regarded as medical emergencies. phone 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you or your child is experiencing a haemorrhage.many of the treatments that are used to treat acute leukaemia can cause infertility. infertility is often temporary, although in some cases it may be permanent.people who are particularly at risk of becoming infertile are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.it may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. for example, men can have samples of their sperm stored. similarly, women can have fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb following treatment.read more aboutinfertilityreceiving a diagnosis of leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. at first, the news may be difficult to take in.the situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings ofstress, anxiety and depression.if you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition.you may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. your gp or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support

       " 'Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Children': 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) is a type of blood cancer. one third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia. approximately, 3 out of 4 of these are acute lymphoblastic (all). all can affect children of any age but is more common in children aged 1 to 4 years old.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. all blood cells are made in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some bones in the body.bone marrow contains:there are 2 different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). these white blood cells work together to fight infection. normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. in leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature.these immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. as the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. this leads to an increased risk of infection.there are 4 main types of leukaemia: acute lymphoblastic (all) acute myeloid (aml) chronic lymphocyte (cll) chronic myeloid (cml)chronic leukaemias usually affect adults and each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment. all is a cancer of immature lymphocytes, called lymphoblasts or blast cells.there are two different types of lymphocytes; t-cells and b-cells. often, leukaemia occurs at a very early stage in the immature lymphocytes, before they have developed into either t-cells or b-cells. however, if the cells have developed this far before becoming leukaemic, the type of leukaemia may be known as t-cell or b-cell leukaemia.this page is about acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all).the exact cause of all is unknown. research is going on all the time into possible causes of this disease. children with certain genetic disorders, such as down’s syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. brothers and sisters of a child with all (particularly identical twins) have a slightly increased risk of developing all themselves, although this risk is still small.like all cancers, all is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.as the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood (which help blood to clot). sometimes, children suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells.a child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands.at first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.a blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of the abnormal leukaemia cells. a sample of bone marrow is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. a sample is also sent to the genetics department to look for any abnormal chromosomes, and for a test called mrd (minimal residual disease) analysis.a test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. a chest x-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. other tests may be necessary, depending on your child’s symptoms.these tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia and help doctors decide on the best treatment.the aim of treatment for all is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. chemotherapy is the main treatment for all and is given according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen).the treatment is given in several phases, or ‘blocks’.this phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible and is usually started within days of being diagnosed. the induction phase lasts 4 to 6 weeks. a bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. the sample that is taken is looked at under a microscope and when there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child’s condition is referred to as being in ‘remission’.the next phase of treatment is aimed at maintaining the remission and preventing the spread of leukaemia cells into the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system, or cns). cns treatment involves injecting a drug, usually methotrexate lumbar puncture.after this consolidation treatment there is a recovery period which is called interim maintenance. this is when more drugs will be given to try to keep the leukaemia in remission. the exact details will depend on which arm of treatment your child follows and will be discussed in detail by your child’s doctor as it depends on your child’s response to treatment so far.further doses of chemotherapy treatment, called ‘delayed intensification’, are given to kill off any remaining leukaemia cells.this phase of treatment lasts for 2 years from the start of interim maintenance for girls and 3 years from the start of interim maintenance for boys. it involves the child taking daily and weekly tablets, some children also have monthly injections of chemotherapy and oral pulses of steroids and 3-monthly intrathecal treatment.children will be able to take part in their normal daily activities as soon as they feel able to. most children return to school before beginning maintenance treatment.bone marrow treatment is only needed by a minority of patients and is used for children with all that is likely to come back following standard chemotherapy.in some situations, it may be necessary for boys to have radiotherapy to their testicles. this is because leukaemia cells can survive in the testicles despite chemotherapy.children who have leukaemia cells in their cns when they are first diagnosed with all need more frequent lumbar punctures with intrathecal chemotherapy. your child’s specialist will discuss with you which treatment and how much of it your child needs, and will answer any questions you have.many cancer treatments will causeside effects. this is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells.some of the main side effects of chemotherapy are: hair loss reduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection loss of appetite feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)steroid medicines can also cause side effects such as: increased appetite mood changes and irritability weight gain muscle weakness (especially in the legs)most side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible side effects. it’s important to discuss any side effects your child is having with the team treating them, so that they know how your child is feeling.a small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. these include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way their heart works and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer later in life. your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. specialist doctors carry out trials for all.if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. written information is provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given enough time to decide if it is right for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the condition is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the uk. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.most children with all are cured. if the leukaemia recurs after initial treatment, it usually does so within the first three years. further treatment can then be given.long-term side effects (late side effects) are rare, and most children with all grow and develop normally.if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",
       " 'Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Teenagers and young adults': 'this section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all). the other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute myeloid leukaemia.if you’re looking for information about all in people of all ages, please see our generalallsection.leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. in leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control. immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. the body needs these cells to: help fight infection (white cells) carry oxygen from the lungs around the body (red blood cells) stop cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets)many of the symptoms of all are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. symptoms can include: looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia) bruises – you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection aches and pains in your bones swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin feeling unwell and run down fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection headaches and visual disturbancethere can be other reasons you may have these symptoms. but if you are worried that you may have all, you should speak to your gp. they’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.it’s not known exactly what causes all. research is going on to try to find out.young people with some genetic conditions, such asdown’s syndromeor li-fraumeni syndrome, are at an increased risk of developing all. a genetic condition is something you are born with.if you think you have some of the symptoms of all you should speak to your gp. they can talk to you about your symptoms and arrange anyteststhey think you might need.to understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow.leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.all blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. a type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs.there are 3 main types of blood cells: white blood cells – which help fight infection red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleedingthe bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. to begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature).the main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. they can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells.once blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. they leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed.in leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made.they build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets.leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. healthy white blood cells are made from two types of blood cells: lymphoblasts that make lymphocytes myeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophilsleukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. the most common types in teenagers and young adults are aml and all: acute myeloid leukaemia(aml) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal lymphoblaststhere are other types of leukaemia that are more common in older people.the information in this section is about all, but if you have a different type of leukaemia and want to know more, contactmacmillan.we also have more information about: symptoms and causes of all having tests for all being treated for allif you’re looking for information about all in people of all ages, read our generalallsection.it’s important to remember that the symptoms of all can be caused by lots of different things. but you should go to your gp if you’re worried. they can talk to you about your symptoms and arrange any tests they think you might need.your gp will examine you and arrange for you to have blood tests. there can be different reasons for your symptoms, so you’ll need a blood test to help diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all). if you have all, a blood test will usually find leukaemia cells and you’ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.this specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood problems.the haematologist will examine you and ask you about your symptoms and any recent illnesses. they will also arrange for you to have some more tests. these may include: blood tests– you’ll need more blood tests even if you’ve had some already to look at the changes in the leukaemia cells and help the doctors decide on the best treatment for you bone marrow test – to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow and get samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing lumbar puncture – a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells chestx-ray– this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chestif you have all, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. these could be blood tests, or an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, and an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart).this may seem like a lot of tests, but they give the doctors important information that will help them give you the right treatment.waiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them – what will happen, how you’ll feel and when you’ll get the results – can help you cope. thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. you could also talk to a macmillancancer support specialiston their free helpline.we also have more information about: symptoms of all being treated for all leukaemia, blood cells and bone marrowif you’re looking for information about all in people of all ages, read our generalallsection.the main treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (all) ischemotherapy. this means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. you’ll also have drugs calledsteroids, which help the chemotherapy to work.the treatment for all is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. but you’ll be in close contact with the hospital when you’re most likely to feel unwell and the staff will be able to help if things get tough. don’t feel you have to be brave. be honest about how you are feeling with your doctors and nurses. they can give you medicines that can help you feel better.all is treated in 3 phases: getting rid of the leukaemia – remission induction keeping the leukaemia away – consolidation and delayed intensification therapy keeping the leukaemia away long-term – continuing or maintenance therapyyou usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have all.you’ll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with. if you’re 18 or younger, you’ll be treated in a specialist principal treatment centre (ptc) for teenagers and young adults (tya). if you’re 19 or older, you’ll be offered the choice of having treatment at the ptc or another hospital closer to home called a tya designated hospital.you’ll be given chemotherapy as tablets, by injection and into your bloodstream (intravenously). you’ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around the spinal cord to make sure the leukaemia cells can’t hide there. this is called central nervous system (cns) therapy. it’s also known as intrathecal therapy.you’ll have a ‘line’ put in to one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous treatment. your nurses and doctors can also use the line to take blood samples for blood tests. there are different kinds of lines.having chemotherapy can be hard. but the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. and you’ll be given medicines to stop you feeling sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections.there will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. you might also feel upset, down or irritable. talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings.being in hospital or coming up to hospital for clinics and treatment can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work, or on things your friends are doing. you could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you. it can also help to talk to any new friends you’ve made who are going through similar experiences to you.we have more information aboutchemotherapythat has been written for people of all ages, not just teens and young adults.the first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. you’ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow.this type of treatment involves: chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells (including cns therapy) steroids to help the chemotherapy work drugs (allopurinol or rasburicase) to help protect your kidneys from problems that can happen when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once another tablet (for example ranitidine or lansoprazole) to stop indigestion or ulcersyou need to stay in hospital during this phase of your treatment so the doctors can check how things are going.treatment to get you into remission takes about 5 weeks, sometimes a bit longer. being in hospital that long can be really difficult at times. if you’re struggling to cope, try and talk to your friends, family, doctors and nurses. it’s important not to bottle up your feelings otherwise your might end up finding it hard to cope. drugs you may be given include: vincristine asparaginase daunorubicin mercaptopurine methotrexatedifferent chemotherapy can cause different side effects. there is information about the specific ones in macmillan’schemotherapy section.chemotherapy given as tablets or into the blood can reach most places in your body. but it isn’t good at getting into the brain or spinal cord (called the central nervous system or cns). so you’ll be given treatment into the fluid that goes around the cns to target any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. this is called cns therapy.cns therapy is given during remission induction treatment (to get rid of the leukaemia) and continues right until the end of maintenance therapy.chemotherapy is given into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or csf, around your spinal cord. drug treatment given into the csf is called intrathecal therapy.it’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. a doctor puts a needle into the space between 2 small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. then they inject chemotherapy into the csf. the csf will carry the chemotherapy around your cns so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there.the chemotherapy drug used for cns therapy is called methotrexate.most people don’t have side effects after having intrathecal methotrexate. but occasionally it can cause headaches, dizziness, tiredness or blurry vision for a few hours. rarely other side effects like seizures (fits), weakness of your arms or legs and changes in how awake you are can happen. but these almost always go away completely and you can still have the intrathecal injections in the future.this treatment is called consolidation and delayed intensification therapy. when you’re in remission, it means the doctors can’t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples when they check them under the microscope. but there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so you need further treatment to get rid of these cells.you’ll be given different types of chemotherapy drugs. this is so the leukaemia cells don’t have a chance to get used to them (which is called drug resistance).this phase of treatment takes about 5 to 6 months. most of the treatment can be given as an outpatient but you might need to stay in hospital for some parts of it.drugs you may be given include: cyclophosphamide cytarabine (ara-c) mercaptopurine methotrexate vincristine asparaginase doxorubicinchemotherapy does cause side effects. there is information about the specific ones in macmillan’schemotherapy section.this treatment is given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as relapse). the chemotherapy is given in low doses. you have it as an outpatient so you can keep doing all your normal, everyday activities when you’re having maintenance therapy.maintenance therapy is given in 12-week cycles.you’ll have: mercaptopurine tablets each day methotrexate tablets once a week steroid tablets for 5 days every 4 weeks vincristine chemotherapy every 4 weeks methotrexate chemotherapy into your cerebrospinal fluid (csf) every 12 weeksat the moment, boys have just over 3 years of maintenance therapy and girls have just over 2 years. this is because it takes a bit longer in boys to get rid of any remaining leukaemia cells.during this time, you’ll have regular check-ups – usually every week or two – to check if your drug doses need to be adjusted and to make sure you’re ok. very often, things like blood tests can be done at your gp practice or at home by a district nurse. ask your doctor or nurse about arranging this. healthtalk.org: leukaemia',\n",
       " 'Acute myeloid leukaemia': 'leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment.acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. the 2 main types of white blood cells are: lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damagethis topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (aml), which is an aggressive cancer of the myeloid cells. the following types of leukaemia are covered separately: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemiathesymptoms of amlusually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. symptoms can include: pale skin tiredness breathlessness frequent infections unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums ornosebleedsin more advanced cases, aml can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding.read more about thecomplications of amlyou should see your gp if you or your child have possible symptoms of aml. although it’s highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause, these symptoms should be investigated.if your gp thinks you may have leukaemia, they’ll arrangeblood teststo check your blood cell production. if the tests suggest there’s a problem, you’ll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment.read more aboutdiagnosing amlaml occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones), produce too many immature white blood cells. these immature cells are known as blast cells.blast cells don’t have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can lead to a decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot).it’s not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there’s no identifiable cause. however, a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing aml have been identified. these include: previouschemotherapyorradiotherapy exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous  radiotherapy treatment) exposure to benzene – a chemical used in manufacturing that’s also found in cigarette smoke having an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such asdown’s syndromeread more about thecauses of amlaml is a rare type of cancer. the risk of developing aml increases with age. it’s most common in people over 65.aml is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed.chemotherapyis the main treatment for aml. it’s used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing).in some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with abone marrow or stem cell transplant, to achieve a cure.read more abouttreating amlthe symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) usually develop over a few weeks, becoming more severe as the number of immature white blood cells (blast cells) in your blood increases.symptoms of aml can include: pale skin tiredness breathlessness a high temperature (fever) excessive sweating weight loss frequent infections unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums ornosebleeds easily bruised skin flat red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae) bone and joint pain a feeling of fullness or discomfort in your tummy (abdomen), caused by swelling of the liver or spleenin rare cases of aml, the affected cells can spread into the central nervous system. this can cause symptoms such asheadaches, fits (seizures), vomiting, blurred vision and dizziness.see your gp if you or your child have these symptoms. although it’s highly unlikely that aml is the cause, these symptoms need to be investigated and treated promptly.acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is caused by a dna mutation in the stem cells in your bone marrow that produce red blood cells, platelets and infection-fighting white blood cells.the mutation causes the stem cells to produce many more white blood cells that are needed.the white blood cells produced are still immature, so they don’t have the infection-fighting properties of fully developed white blood cells. these immature cells are known as ‘blast cells’.as the number of immature cells increases, the amount of healthy red blood cells and platelets decrease, and it’s this fall that causes many of thesymptoms of leukaemia.it’s not known what triggers the genetic mutation in aml, although a number of different factors that can increase your risk of developing the condition have been identified.the main risk factors for aml are outlined below.being exposed to a significant level of radiation can increase your chances of developing aml, although this usually requires exposure at very high levels. for example, rates of aml are higher in people who survived the atomic bomb explosions in japan in 1945.in the uk, most people are unlikely to be exposed to levels of radiation high enough to cause aml. however, some people who have hadradiotherapyas part of their treatment for previous cancer (see below) can be the exception.exposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for aml in adults. benzene is found in petrol, and it’s also used in the rubber industry, although there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.benzene is also found in cigarette smoke, which could explain why people who smoke have an increased risk of developing aml.treatment with radiotherapy and certainchemotherapymedications for an earlier, unrelated cancer can increase your risk of developing aml many years later.leukaemia that develops as a result of previous cancer treatment is called ‘secondary leukaemia’ or ‘treatment-related leukaemia’.people with certain blood disorders – such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis orpolycythaemiavera (pcv) – have an increased risk of developing aml.people with certain genetic disorders, includingdown’s syndromeand fanconi’s anaemia, have an increased risk of developing leukaemia.a number of other environmental factors that could trigger aml have also been suggested, including childhood vaccinations and living near a nuclear power station or a high-voltage power line. however, there’s no clear evidence to suggest that these can increase your risk of developing aml.in the initial stages of diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia (aml), your gp will check for physical signs of the condition and arrange for you to haveblood tests.a high number of abnormal white blood cells, or a very low blood count in the test sample, could indicate the presence of leukaemia. if this is the case, you’ll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions).a haematologist may carry out further blood tests, in addition to some of the tests outlined on this page.to confirm a diagnosis of aml, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. this procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy, which is usually carried out under alocal anaesthetic.the haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a thin needle to remove a sample of liquid bone marrow. in some cases, a larger needle may also be used to remove a small amount of bone and bone marrow together.you won’t feel any pain during the procedure, but you may experience some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. the procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete, and you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight.the bone marrow sample will be checked for cancerous cells. if cancerous cells are present, the biopsy can also be used to determine the type of leukaemia you have.additional tests can be used to reveal more information about the progress and extent of your aml. they can also provide insight into how the condition should be treated. these tests are described below.genetic tests can be carried out on blood and bone marrow samples to identify the genetic makeup of the cancerous cells. there are many specific genetic variations that can occur in aml, and knowing the exact type of aml you have can help doctors make decisions about the most appropriate treatment.for example, people who have a type of aml known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (apml) are known to respond well to a medicine called all trans-retinoic acid (atra).if you have aml, acomputerised tomography (ct) scan,x-rayor echocardiogram (anultrasoundscan of the heart) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy.these tests are carried out because it’s important for doctors to assess your general health before they can decide on the most appropriate treatment for you.in rare situations where it’s thought there’s a risk that aml has spread to your nervous system, alumbar puncturemay be carried out. in this procedure, a needle is used to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds and protects your spine) from your back, so it can be checked for cancerous cells.if cancerous cells are found in your nervous system, you may need to have injections of chemotherapy medication directly into your cerebrospinal fluid as part of your treatment.acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, so treatment will usually begin a few days after a diagnosis has been confirmed.as aml is a complex condition, it’s usually treated by a multidisciplinary team (mdt) – a group of different specialists working together.treatment for aml is often carried out in 2 stages: induction – the aim of this initial stage of treatment is to kill as many leukaemia cells in your blood and bone marrow as possible, restore your blood to proper working order and treat any symptoms you may have consolidation – this stage aims to prevent the cancer returning (relapsing), by killing any remaining leukaemia cells that may be present in your bodythe induction stage of treatment isn’t always successful and sometimes needs to be repeated before consolidation can begin.if you have a relapse after treatment, both re-induction and consolidation may need to be carried out. this may be the same as your first treatment, although it’s likely to involve different medications or a stem cell transplant.if you’re thought to have a high risk of experiencingcomplications of aml treatment– for example, if you’re over 75 years of age or have another underlying health condition – less intensive chemotherapy treatment may be carried out. this is less likely to successfully kill all of the cancerous cells in your body, but it can help control your condition.the initial treatment you have for aml will largely depend on whether you’re fit enough to have intensivechemotherapy, or whether treatment at a lower dosage is recommended.if you can have intensive induction chemotherapy, you’ll usually be given a combination of chemotherapy medication at a high dose to kill the cancerous cells in your blood and bone marrow.this stage of treatment will be carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre, as you’ll need very close medical and nursing supervision.you’ll have regularblood transfusionsbecause your blood won’t contain enough healthy blood cells.you’ll also be vulnerable to infection, so it’s important that you’re in a clean and stable environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection you have can be promptly treated. you may also be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent further infection.depending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from four weeks to a couple of months. you may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve.for intensive treatment, the chemotherapy medications will be injected into a thin tube that’s inserted either into a blood vessel near your heart (central line) or into your arm (a peripherally inserted central catheter, or picc).in very rare cases, chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. this is done using a needle that’s placed into your spine, in a similar way to alumbar puncture.side effects of intensive chemotherapy for aml are common. they can include: nausea vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite sore mouth andmouth ulcers(mucositis) tiredness skin rashes hair loss infertility– which may be temporary or permanent (seecomplications of amlfor more information)most side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. tell a member of your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are medicines that can help you cope better with certain side effects.read more about theside effects of chemotherapyif your doctors don’t think you’re fit enough to withstand the effects of intensive chemotherapy, they may recommend non-intensive treatment. this involves using an alternative type of chemotherapy to the standard intensive therapy, which is designed more to control leukaemia rather than cure it.the main aim of this treatment is to control the level of cancerous cells in your body and limit any symptoms you have, while reducing your risk of experiencing significant side effects of treatment.the medications used during non-intensive chemotherapy may be given through a drip into a vein, by mouth or by injection under the skin, and can often be given on an outpatient basis.if you have the sub-type of aml known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, you’ll usually be given capsules of a medicine called atra, in addition to chemotherapy.atra works by changing the immature white blood cells (blast cells) into mature healthy cells, and can reduce symptoms very quickly.side effects of atra can includeheadaches, nausea, bone pain, anddry mouth, skin and eyes.if induction is successful, the next stage of treatment will be consolidation.this often involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication that are usually given on an outpatient basis, which means that you won’t have to stay in hospital overnight. however, you may need some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection.the consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.many other treatments are used for aml.radiotherapyinvolves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. there are 2 main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat aml: to prepare the body for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant to treat advanced cases that have spread to the nervous system and/or brain, although this is uncommonside effects of radiotherapycan include hair loss, nausea and fatigue. the side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed.if chemotherapy doesn’t work, a possible alternative treatment option is abone marrow or stem cell transplant.before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have intensive high-dose chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy to destroy the cells in their bone marrow. the donated stem cells are given through a tube into a blood vessel, in a similar way to chemotherapy medication.this process can put an enormous amount of strain on the body and cause significant side effects and potential complications, so you’ll usually need to stay in hospital for a few weeks.transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person receiving the donation. the best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type.transplantations are most successful when they’re carried out on children and young people, or older people who are otherwise in good health, and when there’s a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister.read aboutbone marrow donationazacitidine is a possible alternative treatment for adults with aml who can’t have a stem cell transplant.it’s recommended by the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) for use in certain circumstances – for example, depending on the characteristics of the person’s blood and bone marrow.azacitidine is a chemotherapy medication that’s given by injection under the skin. it interferes with the growth of cancer cells and destroys them, and also helps bone marrow to produce normal blood cells.nice has more information aboutazacitidine for the treatment of amlin the uk, a number of clinical trials are currently underway that aim to find the best way of treating aml. clinical trials are studies that use new and experimental techniques to see how well they work in treating, and possibly curing, aml.as part of your treatment, your care team may suggest taking part in a clinical trial to help researchers learn more about the best way to treat your aml, and aml in general. search forclinical trials for aml.if you take part in a clinical trial, you may be offered medication that isn’t licensed for use in the uk and isn’t normally available. however, there’s no guarantee that the techniques being studied in the clinical trial will work better than current treatments.your care team can tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved.if you have acute myeloid leukaemia (aml), you may experience a number of complications. these can be caused by the condition itself, although they can also occur as a side effect of treatment.having a weakened immune system – being immunocompromised – is a common complication of aml.even if your blood is restored to normal working order with treatment, many of the medications that are used to treat aml can temporarily weaken your immune system.this means you’re more vulnerable to developing an infection, and any infection you develop could be more serious than usual. complications arising from infection are the leading cause of death in people with aml. however, if treated early, nearly all infections respond to appropriate treatment.therefore, you may be advised to: take regular doses ofantibioticsto prevent bacterial infections maintain good personal and dental hygiene avoid contact with anyone who’s known to have an infection – even if it’s a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such aschickenpoxormeasles check with your gp to ensure that all of your vaccinations are up to date, although you won’t be able to have any vaccine that contains ‘live’ viruses or bacteria, such as theshingles vaccineandmmr vaccine(against measles, mumps and rubella)report any possible symptoms of an infection to your treatment unit immediately because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent complications.symptoms of an infection can include: a high temperature (fever) aheadache aching muscles diarrhoea tirednessif you have aml, you’ll bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. bleeding may also be excessive.people with advanced aml are more vulnerable to excessive bleeding inside their body, which is the second most common cause of death in people with the condition.serious bleeding can occur: inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as a severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting and confusion inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as coughing up blood, breathing difficulties and a bluish skin tone (cyanosis) inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as vomiting blood and passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like in colourall these types of haemorrhage should be regarded as medical emergencies. dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think a haemorrhage is occurring.many of the treatments that are used to treat aml can causeinfertility. this is often temporary, but in some cases can be permanent.people who are particularly at risk of permanent infertility, are those who have received high doses ofchemotherapyandradiotherapyin preparation for abone marrow or stem cell transplant.your treatment team can give a good estimation of the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances.it may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. for example, men can have their sperm samples stored. similarly, women can have eggs or fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb, following treatment.however, as aml is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, there may not always be time to do this before treatment needs to start. acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  anthony nolan blood cancer uk: acute myeloid leukaemia (alm) healthtalk: leukaemia',\n",
       " 'Acute myeloid leukaemia: Children': 'acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is a type of blood cancer. a third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia. less than a quarter of these are acute myeloid leukaemia (aml). aml can affect children of any age. girls and boys are equally affectedmore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. all blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some of the bones in the body.bone marrow contains:there are 2 different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). these white blood cells work together to fight infection. normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. in leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature.these immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. as the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. this leads to an increased risk of infection.there are 4 main types of leukaemia: acute lymphoblastic (all) acute myeloid (aml) chronic lymphocytic (cll) chronic myeloid (cml)chronic leukaemias occur mostly in adults. cll is exclusively an adult condition, whereas cml does occur rarely in children and young people. each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment.this page is about acute myeloid leukaemia (aml).acute myeloid leukaemia is an overproduction of immature myeloid white blood cells (blast cells).cells that have started to show some of the features of myeloid cells are said to show differentiation. cells that do not show signs of becoming a particular type of white blood cell are known as undifferentiated.there are different sub-types of aml, depending on exactly which type of cell has become leukaemic, the stage of development (maturation) the cells are at, and whether the cells are differentiated. knowing the sub-type of aml is important, as it helps doctors decide on the best treatment.there are several classification systems for the sub-types of aml. the most commonly used system in the uk is the french-american-british (fab) system. m0 – aml with minimal evidence of myeloid differentiation m1 – aml without maturation m2 – aml with maturation m3 – acute promyelocytic leukaemia (apl) m4 – acute myelomonocytic leukaemia m5 – acute monocytic/monoblastic leukaemia m6 – acute erythroleukaemia m7 – acute megakaryoblastic leukaemiaa newer system known as the who (world health organization) classification system is also sometimes used.the exact cause of aml is unknown. research into possible causes of this disease is ongoing. children with certain genetic disorders, such asdown’s syndromeor li-fraumeni syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. brothers and sisters of a child with aml have a slightly increased risk of developing it, although this risk is still small. other non-cancerous conditions, such as aplastic anaemia or the myelodysplastic syndromes (mds), may increase a child’s risk of developing aml.aml, like all types of cancer, is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.as the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood. sometimes they may suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells.a child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands.at first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.a blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of abnormal leukaemia cells. a sample of bone marrow is needed to confirm the diagnosis. the bone marrow sample is also examined to check for any abnormalities in the chromosomes of the leukaemia cells.a test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. a chest x-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. other tests may be necessary, depending on your child’s symptoms.these tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia, and help doctors to decide on the best treatment.the aim of treatment for aml is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. chemotherapy is the main treatment for aml. usually a combination of chemotherapy drugs is given, according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen).the treatment usually has different phases.this phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible. it usually involves 2 courses (cycles) of a combination of chemotherapy drugs.a bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. when there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child’s condition is referred to as being in remission.when there are no signs of the leukaemia in the blood or bone marrow, further treatment is often given. this phase of the treatment aims to destroy any leukaemia cells that may be left and to help stop the aml from coming back. this treatment usually involves 2 more courses of chemotherapy.this treatment is usually only used for children with aml that is likely to come back or has come back (recurred) following standard chemotherapy.aml may sometimes develop in the brain and spinal cord. this can be prevented by injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the spinal fluid during a lumbar puncture (intrathecal chemotherapy). intrathecal chemotherapy is usually given after each of the first 2 courses of chemotherapy. sometimes a more intensive treatment is needed, and the intrathecal drugs are given more frequently until all the regular chemotherapy has been completed. occasionally, radiotherapy to the brain is also necessary.many cancer treatments will causeside effects. this is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells.some of the main side effects are: hair loss reduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection) loss of appetite and weight feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)most side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about side effects.a small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. these include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way the heart works, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer in later life. your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. specialist doctors carry out trials for aml. if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. written information is often provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s cancer. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the cancer is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.many children with aml are cured. if the leukaemia comes back after initial treatment, it usually does so within the first 3 years. most children with aml grow and develop normally.if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",
       " 'Acute myeloid leukaemia: Teenagers and young adults': 'this section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (aml). the other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults isacute lymphoblastic leukaemia.for information about aml in people of all ages, read our generalamlsection.leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. in leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control.immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. the body needs these cells to: help fight infection (white cells) carry oxygen from the lungs around the body (red blood cells) stop cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets)many of the symptoms of aml are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. symptoms can include: looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia) bruises or bleeding – you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection aches and pains in your bones swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin feeling unwell and run down fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection headaches and blurred vision – because of too many white blood cells breathlessness – because of too many white blood cells.it’s not known exactly what causes aml. research is going on to try to find out. we do know some things might increase the risk of aml: some genetic conditions, likedown’s syndrome(a genetic condition is something you are born with) some non-cancerous conditions of the bone marrow, such as aplastic anaemia or myelodysplastic syndromesif you think you might have any of the symptoms of aml, you should go to your gp. they’ll talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and can arrange tests or refer you to see a specialist. remember that the symptoms can be caused by other things, but it’s important to go and get checked if you are worried.to understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow.leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.all blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. a type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs.there are 3 main types of blood cells: white blood cells – which help fight infection red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleedingthe bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. to begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature).the main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. they can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells.once blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. they leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed.in leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made.they build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets.leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. healthy white blood cells are made from 2 types of blood cells: lymphoblasts that make lymphocytes myeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophilsleukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. the most common types in teenagers and young adults are aml and all: acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells acute lymphoblastic leukaemia(all) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal lymphoblaststhere are other types of leukaemia that are more common in older people.the information in this section is about all, but if you have a different type of leukaemia and want to know more, contactmacmillan.we also have more information about: symptoms and causes of aml having tests for aml being treated for amlif you’re looking for information about all in people of all ages, read generalamlsection.you should speak to your gp as soon as possible if you think you have some of thesymptomsof aml. but remember that the symptoms of aml can be caused by other things.your gp will examine you and arrange for you to have blood tests. there can be different reasons for your symptoms, so you’ll need to have a blood test to help diagnose acute myeloid leukaemia (aml). if you have aml, a blood test will usually find leukaemia cells and you’ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.this specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood disorders.the haematologist will examine you and ask you about your symptoms and any recent illnesses. they will also arrange for you to have some more tests. these may include: blood tests– you’ll need more blood tests even if you’ve had some already to look at the changes in the leukaemia cells and help the doctors decide on the best treatment for you; these tests may be called cytogenetics and immunophenotyping bone marrow test – to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow and get send samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing lumbar puncture – a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells chestx-ray– this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chestif you have aml, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. these could be blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, or an echocardiogram (which is an ultrasound of the heart).this may seem like a lot of tests, but they give the doctors important information that will help them give you the right treatment.waiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them – what will happen, how you’ll feel and when you’ll get the results – can help you cope. thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. you could also talk to a cancer support specialist on macmillan’sfree helpline.we also have more information about: symptoms and causes of aml being treated for aml leukaemia, blood cells and bone marrowif you’re looking for information about aml in people of all ages, read our generalamlsection.the main treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (aml) is chemotherapy. this means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. you’ll also have drugs called steroids, which help the chemotherapy to work.the treatment for aml is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. but you’ll be in hospital when you’re most likely to feel unwell, and the staff can help if things get tough. don’t feel you have to be brave. be honest about how you’re feeling with your doctors and nurses. they can give you medicines to help you feel better.there are different phases of treatment for aml: getting rid of the leukaemia – remission induction keeping the leukaemia away – consolidation and delayed intensification therapy central nervous system (cns) therapy (mainly for teenagers under 16)very often, treatment is given as part of a clinical trial or research study, but it will be your decision whether to take part in the trial or not. clinical trials help doctors to keep improving treatment for leukaemia.you usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have aml.you’ll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with. if you’re 18 or younger, you’ll be treated in a specialist principal treatment centre (ptc) for teenage and young adults (tya). if you’re 19 or older, you’ll be offered the choice of having treatment at the ptc or another hospital closer to home called a tya designated hospital.most chemotherapy for aml is given into the bloodstream (intravenously). so you’ll have a ‘line’ put into one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous chemotherapy. there are different kinds of lines.you’ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around your spinal cord and brain. this is to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. this type of treatment is called central nervous system (cns) therapy.having chemotherapy can be hard, but the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. and you’ll be given medicines to help you feel less sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections.there will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. you might also feel upset, down or irritable. talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings.being in hospital for long periods can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work or on things your friends are doing. you could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you.the first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. you’ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow.you have chemotherapy over a few days, then you have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. the days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. you’ll usually have 4 cycles of chemotherapy overall with 2 courses in the induction phase. some people might also need to have a bone marrow transplant. this normally happens after 2 cycles of chemotherapy.you’ll probably need to stay in hospital most of the time that you’re having remission induction. this is so that the doctors can check how things are going.drugs you may have include: cytarabine (ara-c) daunorubicin, doxorubicin or idarubicin etoposide thioguaninedifferent chemotherapy can cause different side effects. there is information about the specific ones in macmillan’schemotherapy section.as well as the chemotherapy drugs, you’ll be given other drugs to: help prevent you from feeling sick or being sick help prevent infections protect your kidneys as sometimes when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once it can cause kidney problemsyou’ll probably also need blood and platelet transfusions to top up the numbers of red cells and platelets in your blood.chemotherapy can cause side effects. most of them are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops. the most common side effects are: being more at risk of infections feeling sick hair loss a sore mouthsometimes side effects can be long-term. for example, some chemotherapy treatments can affect fertility (your ability to have a baby). if you are a young man, you will be offered the chance to store sperm before chemotherapy is started. there may be other late effects of treatment and your specialist can talk to you about this.remission induction is pretty intense treatment and you’ll probably feel a bit wiped out sometimes. you’ll need to stay in hospital for most of the time and you might not have the energy to do much. you might feel fed up, tearful or irritable. it’s normal to feel like this. it’s hard to be in hospital and you might worry about losing touch with your friends or falling behind at school or college. it can help to talk about this with a friend, doctor, nurse or counsellor.this phase of treatment is sometimes also called consolidation or intensification treatment. it’s given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as a relapse).when you’re in remission, it means the doctors can’t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples under the microscope. but there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so further treatment is needed to get rid of these cells.you start post-remission treatment soon after you complete remission induction. you’ll usually have 2 courses of treatment. you might be given the same chemotherapy drugs you’ve had before (perhaps at similar or higher doses) or you might be given different chemotherapy drugs.when your doctors decide what chemotherapy treatment plan to give you, they will take into account: how well your leukaemia responded to the first lot of treatment (remission

16 or over. but if you’re under 16, you’ll probably have it.cns therapy is given to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be in the brain or spinal cord. (the cns or central nervous system is the name for the brain and spinal cord.)cns therapy involves giving chemotherapy into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or csf, around the spinal cord and brain.it’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. a doctor puts a needle into the space between two small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. then they inject chemotherapy into the csf. the csf will carry the chemotherapy around your cns so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there.you’ll have a lumbar puncture before you start treatment to check for leukaemia cells in the csf.if there is no sign of leukaemia cells, you’ll have 2 lots of cns therapy, 1 after each cycle of remission induction therapy.if there are leukaemia cells in the csf, you’ll have cns therapy twice a week until all traces of leukaemia cells in your csf have gone. you’ll then have 2 more lots of cns therapy just to make sure.for cns therapy for aml, you’ll have chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate and cytarabine and a steroid called hydrocortisone.the most common side effect is feeling sick but you can be given anti-sickness treatment to help this. rarer side effects include a headache, dizziness, tiredness or blurry vision for a few hours afterwards.we also have more information about: symptoms and causes of aml having tests for aml leukaemia, blood cells and bone marrowif you’re looking for information about aml in people of all ages, read our generalamlsection.',\n",
       " 'Acute pancreatitis': 'acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. the pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage.most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and experience no further problems, but severe cases can have serious complications and can even be fatal.acute pancreatitis is different tochronic pancreatitis, where the inflammation of the pancreas persists for many years.the most common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include: suddenly getting severe pain in the centre of your abdomen (tummy) feeling or being sick diarrhoearead more about thesymptoms of acute pancreatitisanddiagnosing acute pancreatitis.contact your gp immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. if this isn’t possible, contactnhs 24’s 111 serviceor your localout-of-hours servicefor advice.it’s thought that acute pancreatitis occurs when a problem develops with some of the enzymes (chemicals) in the pancreas, which causes them to try to digest the organ.acute pancreatitis is most often linked to: gallstones– which accounts for around half of all cases alcohol consumption – which accounts for about a quarter of all casesby reducing your alcohol intake and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can help to reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis.read more about thecauses of acute pancreatitisandpreventing acute pancreatitis.acute pancreatitis is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it can affect people of any age.men are more likely to develop alcohol-related pancreatitis, while women are more likely to develop it as a result of gallstones.treatment for acute pancreatitis focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed.this usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids), as well as pain relief, nutritional support and oxygen through tubes into your nose.most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days.however, recovery takes longer in severe cases, as complications that require additional treatment may develop.read more abouttreating acute pancreatitis.about 4 out of 5 cases of acute pancreatitis improve quickly and don’t cause any serious further problems. however, 1 in 5 cases are severe and can result in life-threatening complications, such as multiple organ failure.in severe cases where complications develop, there’s a high risk of the condition being fatal.if a person survives the effects of severe acute pancreatitis, it’s likely to be several weeks or months before they’re well enough to leave hospital.read more about the possiblecomplications of acute pancreatitis.the main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe, dull pain around the top of your stomach that develops suddenly.this aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. eating or drinking may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods.leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain.acute pancreatitis caused bygallstonesusually develops after eating a large meal. if the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6 to 12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol.other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include: nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting diarrhoea indigestion a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes tenderness or swelling of the abdomen (tummy)contact your gp immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. if this isn’t possible, contactnhs 24 111 serviceor your localout-of-hours servicefor advice.most cases of acute pancreatitis are closely linked to gallstones or to alcohol consumption, although the exact cause isn’t always clear.gallstonesare hard pieces of stone-like material that form in your gallbladder. they can trigger acute pancreatitis if they move out of the gallbladder and block the opening of the pancreas.the blockage can disrupt some of the enzymes (chemicals) produced by the pancreas. these enzymes are normally used to help digest food in your intestines, but they can start to digest the pancreas instead if the opening is blocked.however, not everyone with gallstones will develop acute pancreatitis. most gallstones don’t cause any problems.it’s not fully understood how alcohol causes the pancreas to become inflamed. one theory is that it interferes with the normal workings of the pancreas, causing the enzymes to start digesting it.whatever the cause, there is a clear link between alcohol use and acute pancreatitis. a very large study found that people who regularly drank more than 35 units of alcohol a week were 4 times more likely to develop acute pancreatitis than people who never drank alcohol (35 units is the equivalent of drinking around 16 cans of strong lager or 4 bottles of wine a week).binge drinking, which is drinking a lot of alcohol in a short period of time, is also thought to increase your risk of developing acute pancreatitis.less common causes of acute pancreatitis include: accidental damage or injury to the pancreas – for example, during a procedure toremove gallstonesor examine the pancreas certain types of medication, such as someantibioticsorchemotherapymedication – acute pancreatitis can be an unexpected side effect of these in a small number of people a viral infection – such asmumpsormeasles a complication ofcystic fibrosis certain rare conditions – including hyperparathyroidism, reye’s syndrome andkawasaki diseaselittle is known about why some people develop severe acute pancreatitis. factors thought to increase your risk include: being 70 years of age or over beingobese(a person is considered obese if they have abody mass index (bmi)of 30 or above) having 2 or more alcoholic drinks a day smokingresearchers have also discovered that people with a specific genetic mutation, known as the mcp-1 mutation, are 8 times more likely to develop severe acute pancreatitis than the general population. a genetic mutation is where the instructions (dna) found in all living cells become scrambled, resulting in a genetic disorder or a change in characteristics.most cases of acute pancreatitis are diagnosed in hospital because of the risk of serious complications.the doctor in charge of your care will ask you about the history of your symptoms. they may also carry out a physical examination. if you have acute pancreatitis, certain areas of your abdomen will be very tender to touch.ablood testwill be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis. this can detect signs of acute pancreatitis, such as a high level of 2 chemicals called lipase and amylase.at first, it can be difficult to tell whether your acute pancreatitis is mild or severe. you’ll be monitored closely for signs of serious problems, such as organ failure.people with mild acute pancreatitis tend to improve within a week and experience either no further problems or problems that resolve within 48 hours. people with severe acute pancreatitis develop persistent serious problems.several tests may be used to help determine the severity of your condition and assess your risk of developing more serious complications.you may have any of the following tests: acomputerised tomography (ct) scan– where a series of x-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, 3d image of your pancreas amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body an ultrasound scan– where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp)an ercp uses a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. the endoscope will be passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. a special dye that shows up onx-raysis then injected through the endoscope into your bile and pancreatic ducts. after the dye has been injected, x-rays will be taken.this test can be useful in cases of gallbladder-associated acute pancreatitis, because it can pinpoint exactly where the gallstone is located. in some cases, it may be possible to pass surgical instruments down the endoscope, so the gallstone can be removed.acute pancreatitis is treated in hospital, where you’ll be closely monitored for signs of serious problems and given supportive treatment, such as fluids and oxygen.many people are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days.in severe cases, complications can develop that require specific additional treatment and you’ll need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit (icu). in these cases, recovery may take much longer, and the condition can be fatal.read about the potentialcomplications of acute pancreatitisfor more information on severe cases.your body can become dehydrated during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids are provided through a tube connected to one of your veins (this is known as intravenous, or iv, fluid).in severe cases of acute pancreatitis, iv fluids can help to prevent a serious problem called hypovolemic shock, which occurs when a drop in your fluid levels lowers the amount of blood in your body.although the diet of many people with mild acute pancreatitis isn’t restricted, some people are advised not to eat. this is because trying to digest solid food could place too much strain on your pancreas.depending on the severity of the condition, you may not be able to eat solid foods for a few days or longer.if you need to avoid solid food, a feeding tube may be used to provide your body with nutrients. this is known as enteral feeding and often involves using a tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube).to ensure your vital organs have enough oxygen, it will usually be supplied through tubes into your nose. the tubes can be removed after a few days, once your condition is improving.in severe cases, ventilation equipment may also be used to assist with your breathing.acute pancreatitis often causes severe abdominal (tummy) pain, so strong painkilling medication will probably be required, such as morphine.some of the painkillers used can make you feel very drowsy. if you’re visiting someone who is in hospital with acute pancreatitis, don’t be alarmed or concerned if they appear drowsy or unresponsive.once the condition is under control, the underlying cause may need to be treated.if agallstoneis responsible for the pancreatitis, you may need a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp), or your gallbladder may need to be removed.gallbladder removal surgerymay be done while you’re in hospital, or it may be planned for several weeks’ time. having your gallbladder removed should have no significant effect on your health, other than making it more difficult to digest certain foods, such as fatty or spicy foods.an ercp procedure is an alternative treatment for gallstones. it involves using a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end.x-raysguide the endoscope into your digestive system, and surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope to remove the gallstones.after recovering from acute pancreatitis, alcohol should be completely avoided if this was the cause of the condition. if you find this difficult, you’ll probably need additional treatment.treatment options for alcohol dependence include: one-to-one counselling self-help groups – such asalcoholics anonymous a medication called acamprosate – which helps to reduce your alcohol cravingsalthough most people with acute pancreatitis recover without experiencing further problems, severe cases can have serious complications.pseudocysts are sacs of fluid that can develop on the surface of the pancreas. they’re a common complication of acute pancreatitis, thought to affect around 1 in 20 people with the condition.pseudocysts usually develop 4 weeks after the symptoms of acute pancreatitis start. in many cases, they don’t cause any symptoms and are only detected during acomputerised tomography (ct) scan.however, in some people, pseudocysts can cause bloating,indigestionand a dull abdominal (tummy) pain.if the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for further treatment, as they usually go away on their own.treatment is usually recommended if you’re experiencing symptoms or if the pseudocysts are large. larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection.pseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst by inserting a needle into it through your skin. this can also be done by carrying out an endoscopy, where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid.in around 1 in 3 severe cases of acute pancreatitis, a serious complication called infected pancreatic necrosis occurs.in infected pancreatic necrosis, high levels of inflammation cause an interruption to the blood supply of your pancreas. without a consistent supply of blood, some of the tissue of your pancreas will die. necrosis is the medical term for the death of tissue.the dead tissue is extremely vulnerable to infection from bacteria. once an infection has occurred, it can quickly spread into the blood (blood poisoning) and cause multiple organ failure. if left untreated, infected pancreatic necrosis is almost always fatal.infected pancreatic necrosis usually develops 2 to 6 weeks after the symptoms of acute pancreatitis starts. symptoms include increased abdominal pain and a high temperature. the infection is treated with injections ofantibiotics, and the dead tissue needs to be removed to prevent the infection returning.in some cases, it may be possible to drain away the dead tissue using a thin tube called a catheter, which is placed through the skin.alternatively, laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery) can be used. a small cut is made in your back and an endoscope is inserted to wash away any dead tissue. if laparoscopic surgery isn’t possible, a cut can be made in your abdomen to allow the dead tissue to be removed.infected pancreatic necrosis is a very serious complication. even with the highest standards of medical care, the risk of dying from organ failure is estimated to be around 1 in 5.another common complication of severe acute pancreatitis is systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs). sirs develops in an estimated 1 in 10 severe cases of acute pancreatitis.in sirs, the inflammation affecting the pancreas spreads throughout the body, which can cause one or more organs to fail. it usually develops during the first week after the symptoms start, with most cases developing on the same day.symptoms of sirs include: a rise in body temperature to above 38c (100.4f) or a fall in body temperature to below 36c (96.8f) a rapid heartbeat of more than 90 beats a minute an unusually fast breathing rate (more than 20 breaths a minute)there’s currently no cure for sirs, so treatment involves trying to support the body’s functions until the inflammation has passed. the outcome depends on how many organs fail. the higher the number of organs affected, the greater the risk of death.if you have repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, the damage to your pancreas may lead tochronic pancreatitis.chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition that can have a serious impact on your quality of life.as acute pancreatitis is often caused by gallstones or excessive alcohol consumption, a healthy lifestyle can reduce your chances of developing the condition.the most effective way of preventinggallstonesis eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day).your diet should also include wholegrains, found in wholemeal bread, oats and brown rice. this helps lower the amount of cholesterol in your body.there is also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones.because of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it’s advisable to avoid eating too many fatty foods with a high cholesterol content.foods high in cholesterol include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter and lard cakes and biscuitsbeing overweight also increases your chances of developing gallstones, so maintaining a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and taking plenty of regular exercise can also help reduce your risk of developing the condition.read more information and advice aboutexercise,healthy eatingandlosing weight.limiting the amount of alcohol you drink can help prevent your

       " 'Addison’s disease': 'addison’s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands.the adrenal glands are 2 small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. they produce essential hormones: cortisol, aldosterone and adrenaline.in addison’s disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced.about 8,400 people in the uk have addison’s disease. it can affect people of any age. it’s most common between the ages of 30 and 50. it’s also more common in women than men.early-stage symptoms of addison’s disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such asdepressionorflu. you may experience: fatigue (lack of energy or motivation) muscle weakness low mood loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss increased thirstover time, these problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, cramps and exhaustion. you may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums.although these symptoms aren’t always caused by addison’s disease, you should see your gp, so they can be investigated.read more about thesymptoms of addison’s diseaseanddiagnosing addison’s diseasethe condition is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. it’s not clear why this happens, but it’s responsible for 70% to 90% of cases in the uk.other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such astuberculosis (tb), although this is uncommon in the uk.read more about thecauses of addison’s diseaseaddison’s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. you’ll need to take the medication for the rest of your life.with treatment, symptoms of addison’s disease can largely be controlled. most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life, with few limitations.however, many people with addison’s disease also find they must learn to manage bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions, such asdiabetesor anunderactive thyroid.people with addison’s disease must be aware of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. this can happen when the levels of cortisol in your body fall significantly due to not taking your medicines, or during another illness.an adrenal crisis is a medical emergency and warning signs include severe nausea, confusion, fever, headache and weakness. if left untreated, it can be fatal. if you or someone you know has addison’s disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, phone 999 for an ambulance.read more abouttreating addison’s diseaseif you have addison’s disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the national congenital anomaly and rare diseases registration service (ncardrs).this helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. you can opt out of the register at any time.find out more about the registeraddison’s disease can be difficult to detect at first, because early symptoms are similar to symptoms of many other health conditions.initial symptoms of addison’s disease can include: fatigue (lack of energy or motivation) lethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness) muscle weakness low mood (milddepression) or irritability loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss the need to urinate frequently increased thirst craving for salty foodsdehydrationcan also be an early sign of addison’s disease. it’s caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water.further symptoms of addison’s disease tend to develop gradually over months or years. however, additional stress, caused by another illness or an accident, for example, may cause your symptoms to suddenly get worse.you may go on to develop: low blood pressurewhen you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting feeling sick (nausea) vomiting diarrhoea abdominal, joint or back pain muscle cramps chronic exhaustion, which may cause depression brownish discolouration of the skin, lips and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees areduced libido (lack of interest in sex), particularly in womensome women may also have irregular periods or miss some periods completely. children with addison’s disease may experience puberty later than usual.some people with addison’s disease also developlow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). this can cause symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, confusion, anxiety and even unconsciousness (particularly in children).if you’re experiencing symptoms of addison’s disease, see your gp so they can diagnose or rule out the condition. these symptoms will usually improve with appropriate treatment.read more aboutdiagnosing addison’s diseaseandtreating addison’s diseaseif addison’s disease is left untreated, the levels of hormones produced by the adrenal gland gradually decrease in the body. this causes your symptoms to get progressively worse and eventually lead to a life-threatening situation called an adrenal or addisonian crisis.during an adrenal crisis, the symptoms of addison’s disease appear quickly and severely. this could happen when you’re already experiencing initial symptoms or without any symptoms at all.signs of an adrenal crisis include: severedehydration pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing dizziness severe vomiting anddiarrhoea severe muscle weakness headache severe drowsiness or loss of consciousnessan adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. if left untreated, it can be fatal. if you think you or someone you know with addison’s disease is having an adrenal crisis, phone 999 for an ambulance.if an adrenal crisis isn’t treated, it can lead to acomaand death. there’s also a risk your brain won’t get enough oxygen if treatment is delayed, which can cause permanent disability.addison’s disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (your adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces.in the uk, a problem with the immune system is the most common cause of addison’s disease, accounting for 70% to 90% of cases.the immune system is your body’s defence against infection and disease. if you’re ill, your immune system produces antibodies (a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins). these antibodies attack the cause of the illness.however, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. this is known as an autoimmune disorder.addison’s disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex. when 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands won’t be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. once levels of these start decreasing, you’ll experiencesymptoms of addison’s disease.it’s not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families.research has shown that some people with certain genes are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders.it’s not clear how these genes lead to addison’s disease and similar conditions, but it does mean your risk of developing addison’s disease is increased if you or a close family member have another autoimmune condition, such as: vitiligo – a chronic (long-term) condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin type 1 diabetes– a chronic condition caused by too much glucose in the blood underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)tuberculosis (tb)is the most common cause of addison’s disease worldwide, but is rare in the uk. tb is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of your body. it can cause addison’s disease if it damages your adrenal glands.other possible causes of addison’s disease include: infections – such as those linked toaids, or fungal infections a haemorrhage – very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated withmeningitisor other types of severesepsis cancer – ifcancercells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands amyloidosis – a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them surgical removal of both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) – for example, to remove a tumour adrenoleukodystrophy (ald) – a rare, life-limiting, inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands and nerve cells in the brain that most often affects young boys certain treatments needed for cushing’s syndrome – a collection of symptoms caused by very high levels of cortisol in the bodyto help diagnose addison’s disease, your gp will first ask about your symptoms and review your medical history.they’re also likely to ask if anyone in your family has an autoimmune disorder (a condition caused by a problem with their immune system).your gp will examine your skin for any evidence of brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation), particularly in certain areas, such as: where skin creases on your palm in your elbow crease on any scars your lips and gumshowever, hyperpigmentation doesn’t occur in all cases of addison’s disease.you’ll also be tested forlow blood pressure (hypotension)while you’re lying down and again shortly after you stand up. this is to see whether you have postural or orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when you change position).if addison’s disease is suspected,blood testswill be carried out to measure the levels of sodium, potassium and cortisol in your body. a low sodium, high potassium or low cortisol level may indicate addison’s disease.you may need to see a hospital hormone specialist (endocrinologist) for your blood to be tested for the following: a low level of the hormone aldosterone a high level of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth) a low level of glucose (sugar used for energy) positive adrenal antibodies (antibodies designed to attack the adrenal gland)any of these could be a sign of addison’s disease.if cortisol in your blood is low, or your symptoms strongly suggest addison’s disease, you’ll need to have a synacthen stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis.your gp may refer you to an endocrinology unit (a unit that specialises in the study of hormones) for the test. how urgently you’re referred depends on how severe your symptoms are.synacthen is a man-made (synthetic) copy of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth). acth is naturally produced by the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland below the brain) to encourage the adrenal glands to release the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.when synacthen is administered, the adrenal glands should respond in the same way as they would to acth, and release cortisol and other steroid hormones into the blood.a blood sample will be taken and tested for cortisol, before an injection of synacthen is given into your arm. after 30 and 60 minutes, a further blood sample will be taken for cortisol measurement.if the acth level is high, but the cortisol and aldosterone levels are low, it’s usually confirmation of addison’s disease.as well as a synacthen stimulation test, your thyroid gland may also be tested to see if it’s working properly.your thyroid gland is found in your neck. it produces hormones that control your body’s growth and metabolism.people with addison’s disease often have anunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. by testing the levels of certain hormones in your blood, your endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone conditions) can determine whether you have hypothyroidism.in some cases, your specialist may refer you for a scan of your adrenal glands. this could be acomputerised tomography (ct) scanor amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan.if addison’s disease is left untreated, it eventually leads to an adrenal crisis. this is where thesymptoms of addison’s diseaseappear quickly and severely.during an adrenal crisis, there’s not enough time to perform a synacthen stimulation test to confirm addison’s disease.if possible, blood will be taken and tested for any of the abnormalities listed above. while you’re waiting for the results, treatment may be started with steroid injections, and fluids containing salt and glucose.read more abouttreating addison’s diseaseif you’re diagnosed with addison’s disease and have a bus, coach or lorry licence, it’s your legal obligation to inform the driver and vehicle licensing agency (dvla).read aboutdriving and addison’s diseaseon the gov.uk website.if you have addison’s disease, you’ll need to take daily medication to replace the lost hormones. this should help you to live an active life, although many people find they still need to manage their fatigue.in some cases, the underlying causes of addison’s disease can be treated. for example,tuberculosis (tb)is treated with a course ofantibioticsover a period of at least 6 months.however, most cases are caused by a problem with the immune system that can’t be cured.treatment usually involvescorticosteroid (steroid)replacement therapy for life. corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that your body no longer produces. it’s usually taken in tablet form 2 or 3 times a day.in most cases, a medication called hydrocortisone is used to replace the cortisol. other possible medicines are prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used.aldosterone is replaced with a medication called fludrocortisone. your gp may also ask you to add extra salt to your daily diet, although if you’re taking enough fludrocortisone medicine this may not be necessary. unlike most people, if you feel the urge to eat something salty, then you should eat it.in general, the medications used for addison’s disease don’t have side effects, unless your dose is too high. if you take a higher dose than necessary for a long time, there’s a risk of problems such asweakened bones (osteoporosis), mood swings anddifficulty sleeping (insomnia).many people with addison’s disease find that taking their medication enables them to continue with their normal diet and exercise routines. however, bouts of fatigue are also common, and it can take some time to learn how to manage these periods of low energy.some people find that needing to take regular doses of medication is restrictive and affects their daily life or emotional health. missing a dose of medication, or taking it late, can also lead to exhaustion or insomnia.some people can develop associated health conditions, such asdiabetesor anunderactive thyroid, which require extra treatment and management.you’ll usually need to have appointments with an endocrinologist every 6 to 12 months, so they can review your progress and adjust your medication dose, if necessary. your gp can provide support and repeat prescriptions in between these visits.failing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so you must: remember to collect your repeat prescriptions keep spare medication as necessary – for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you take your medication every day at the right time pack extra medication if you are going away – usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below) carry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessaryyou could also inform close friends or colleagues of your condition. tell them about the signs of adrenal crisis and what they should do if you experience one.it’s also a good idea to wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that informs people you have addison’s disease.after a serious accident, such as a car crash, a healthy person produces more cortisol. this helps you cope with the stressful situation and additional strain on your body that results from serious injury. as your body cannot produce cortisol, you’ll need a hydrocortisone injection to replace it and prevent an adrenal crisis.wearing a medical alert bracelet will inform any medical staff treating you about your condition, and what medication you require.medical alert bracelets or necklaces are pieces of jewellery engraved with your medical condition and an emergency contact number. they are available from a number of retailers. ask your gp if there’s one they recommend, or go to themedicalertwebsite.if you need to stay in hospital, the healthcare professionals responsible for your care will also need to know you need steroid replacement medication throughout your stay. it’s important to note that this advice still applies if you’re not supposed to eat or drink (nil by mouth) for any reason.at certain times, your medication may need to be adjusted to take into account any additional strain on your body. for example, you may need to increase the dosage of your medication if you experience any of the following: an illness or infection – particularly if you have a high temperature of 37.5c (99.5f) an accident, such as a car crash an operation, dental or medical procedure (such as a tooth filling or endoscopy) you’re taking part in strenuous exercise not usually part of your daily lifethis will help your body cope with the additional stress. your endocrinologist will monitor your dosage and advise about any changes. over time, as you get used to the condition and learn what can trigger your symptoms, you may learn how to adjust your medication yourself. however, always consult your gp or specialist if you’re unsure.you and a partner or family member may be trained to administer an injection of hydrocortisone in an emergency.this could be necessary if you go into shock after an injury, or if you experience vomiting or diarrhoea and are unable to keep down oral medication. this may occur if you’re pregnant and have morning sickness. your endocrinologist will discuss with you when an injection might be necessary.if you need to administer emergency hydrocortisone, always phone your gp immediately afterwards. check whatout-of-hours servicesare available in your local area, in case the emergency is outside normal working hours.you can also register yourself with your localambulance service, so they have a record of your requirement for a steroid injection or tablets, if you need their assistance.adrenal crisis, or addisonian crisis, needs urgent medical attention. phone 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you know are experiencing adrenal crisis.signs of an adrenal crisis include: severedehydration pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing dizziness severe vomiting anddiarrhoea severe muscle weakness headache severe drowsiness or loss of consciousnessin hospital, you’ll be given lots of fluid through a vein in your arm to rehydrate you. this will contain a mixture of salts and sugars (sodium, glucose and dextrose) to replace those that your body is lacking. you’ll also be injected with hydrocortisone to replace the missing cortisol hormone.any underlying causes of the adrenal crisis, such as an infection, will also be treated. underactive thyroid',\n",
       " 'Alcohol-related liver disease': 'alcohol-related liver disease (arld) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. there are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms.arld doesn’t usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. when this happens, symptoms can include: feeling sick weight loss loss of appetite yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) swelling in the ankles and tummy confusion or drowsiness vomiting blood or passing blood in your stoolsthis means arld is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage.if you regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your gp so they can check if your liver is damaged.read more about: symptoms of arld diagnosing arldwith the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body. its functions include: filtering toxins from the blood aiding digestion of food regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels helping fight infection and diseasethe liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die.the liver can develop new cells, but prolongedalcohol misuse(drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. this can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver.arld is very common in the uk – the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse.read more about thecauses of arld.there are 3 main stages of arld, although there’s often an overlap between each stage. these stages are explained below.drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. this is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of arld.fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it’s an important warning sign that you’re drinking at a harmful level.fatty liver disease is reversible. if you stop drinking alcohol for 2 weeks, your liver should return to normal.alcoholic hepatitis – which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis – is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. when this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they’re damaging their liver through alcohol.less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time(binge drinking).the liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently.severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness. many people die from the condition each year in the uk, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage.cirrhosisis a stage of arld where the liver has become significantly scarred. even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms.it’s generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy.a person who has alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn’t stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5 more years.there’s currently no specific medical treatment for arld. the main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. this reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering.if a person is dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. however, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcoholsupport services.aliver transplantmay be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn’t improve when you stop drinking alcohol.you’ll only be considered for a liver transplant if you’ve developed complications ofcirrhosis, despite having stopped drinking. all liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life.read more abouttreating arld.death rates linked to arld have risen considerably over the last few decades. alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the uk, along withsmokingandhigh blood pressure.life-threatening complications of arld include: internal (variceal) bleeding build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure liver cancerread more about thecomplications of arld.the most effective way to prevent arld is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to thelow-risk drinking guidelines.even if you’ve been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health.read ourdrinking and alcoholpages for more information and advice.in many cases, people with alcohol-related liver disease (arld) don’t have any noticeable symptoms until their liver is badly damaged.if you do experience early symptoms of arld, these are often quite vague, such as: abdominal pain loss of appetite fatigue feeling sick diarrhoea feeling generally unwellas the liver becomes more severely damaged, more obvious and serious symptoms can develop, such as: yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, due to a build-up of fluid (oedema) swelling in your abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites a high temperature (fever) and shivering attacks very itchy skin hair loss unusually curved fingertips and nails (clubbed fingers) blotchy red palms significant weight loss weakness and muscle wasting confusion and memory problems, trouble sleeping (insomnia) and changes in your personality due to a build-up of toxins in the brain vomiting blood and black, tarry stools due to internal bleeding a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequentnosebleedsand bleeding gums increased sensitivity to alcohol and drugs (because the liver can’t process them)arld doesn’t often cause symptoms until it’s reached an advanced stage. if you misuse alcohol, you may have liver damage, even though you have none of these symptoms.read aboutalcohol misuse (drinking too much).contact your gp for advice if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse.a good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the cage test, which consists of 4 questions: have you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking? have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking? have you ever felt guilty about your drinking? have you ever drunk an ‘eye-opener’, which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves?if you answer yes to 1 or more of the questions, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your gp.see your gp as soon as possible if you have symptoms of advanced arld.read more abouthow arld is diagnosed.alcohol-related liver disease (arld) is caused by drinking too much alcohol. the more you drink above the recommended limits, the higher your risk of developing arld.there are 2 waysalcohol misuse(drinking too much) can cause arld. these are: drinking a large amount of alcohol in a short amount of time(binge drinking)can cause fatty liver disease and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol over many years can cause hepatitis andcirrhosis, the more serious types of arldevidence suggests people who regularly drink more than the recommended maximum amounts are most at risk of developing arld.read more aboutalcohol units and how to calculate them.as well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, other factors can increase your chances of developing arld. these include: being overweight orobese being female – women appear to be more vulnerable than men to the harmful effects of alcohol having a pre-existing liver condition, such ashepatitis c genetics – alcohol dependence and problems processing alcohol often run in familiesalcohol-related liver disease (arld) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver.this is because the condition causes few obvious symptoms in the early stages.if a doctor suspects arld, they’ll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. they may also ask about your alcohol consumption.it’s important to be totally honest about how much and how often you drink alcohol to avoid further unnecessary testing. this could lead to a delay in the treatment you need.blood testsused to assess the liver are known as liver function tests. however, liver function tests can be normal at many stages of liver disease.blood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver. a low level of serum albumin suggests your liver isn’t functioning properly.a blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage.lab tests online has more information onliver function tests.if your symptoms or liver function test suggest an advanced form of arld – either alcoholic hepatitis orcirrhosis– you may need further tests.scans may be needed to produce detailed images of your liver. this may include: anultrasound scan acomputerised tomography (ct) scan amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scansome scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred.during a liverbiopsy, a fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs). a small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope.the biopsy is usually carried out underlocal anaesthetic, either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital.specialist doctors will examine the liver biopsy tissue under the microscope to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage.an endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end. during an endoscopy, the instrument is passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach.pictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. the doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis.successful treatment for alcohol-related liver disease (arld) often depends on whether someone is willing to stop drinking alcohol and make changes to their lifestyle.treatment for arld involves stopping drinking alcohol. this is known as abstinence, which can be vital, depending on what stage the condition is at.if you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least 2 weeks. after this point, it’s usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to thenhs guidelines on alcohol consumption.if you have a more serious form of arld – alcoholic hepatitis orcirrhosis– life-long abstinence is recommended. this is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease.stopping drinking isn’t easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with arld have an alcohol dependency problem.nevertheless, if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis and don’t stop drinking, no medical or surgical treatment can prevent liver failure.if you’re abstaining from alcohol, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms. these will be at their worst for the first 48 hours, but should start to improve as your body adjusts to being without alcohol. this usually takes 3 to 7 days from the time of your last drink.many people initially experience disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month.in some cases, you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems. you may also be offered a medication called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt), to help you through the withdrawal process.some people need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases, so their progress can be closely monitored.if you’re staying at home, you’ll regularly see a nurse or other health professional. you might see them at home, at your gp surgery or at a specialist nhs service.once you’ve stopped drinking, you may need further treatment to help ensure you don’t start drinking again.the first treatment usually offered is psychological therapy. this involves seeing a therapist to talk about your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing.if psychological therapy alone isn’t effective, you may also need medication to help you abstain from alcohol, such as: acamprosate naltrexone disulfiramread our page ontreating alcohol misusefor more information on the treatments offered.many people with alcohol dependence find it useful to attend self-help groups to help them stop drinking. one of the most well-known isalcoholics anonymous, but there are many other groups that can help.read thealcohol supportpage for more information about the help available.malnutritionis common in people with arld, so it’s important to eat abalanced dietto help ensure you get all the nutrients you need.avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build-up of fluid.the damage to your liver can also mean it’s unable to store glycogen – a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. when this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. therefore, you may need extra energy and protein in your diet.healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. it may also be helpful to eat 3 or 4 small meals a day, rather than 1 or 2 large meals.your gp can advise you on a suitable diet or, in some cases, refer you to a dietitian.in the most serious cases of malnutrition, nutrients may need to be provided through a feeding tube inserted through the nose and into the stomach.the use of medication to directly treat arld is controversial. many experts have argued there’s limited evidence for its effectiveness.for people with severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment in hospital may be necessary. specific treatment with corticosteroids or pentoxifylline medication may be used to reduce inflammation of the liver in some people with this condition.nutritional support is also an important part of treatment in these cases.other medications that have been used to treat liver damage include: anabolic steroids (a more powerful type of steroid medication) ropylthiouracil (a type of medicine originally designed to treatoveractive thyroid glands)however, there’s a lack of good evidence that these help and they’re no longer used for severe alcoholic hepatitis.in the most serious cases of arld, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to liver failure. aliver transplantis currently the only way to cure irreversible liver failure.a liver transplant may be considered if: you develop progressive liver failure, despite not drinking alcohol you’re otherwise well enough to survive such an operation you commit to not drinking alcohol for the rest of your lifea number of serious complications can develop if you have alcohol-related liver disease (arld).portal hypertension is a common complication ofcirrhosisand, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis. it occurs when the blood pressure inside your liver has risen to a potentially serious level.when the liver becomes severely scarred, it’s harder for blood to move through it. this leads to an increase in the pressure of blood around the intestines.the blood must also find a new way to return to your heart. it does this by opening up new blood vessels, usually along the lining of your stomach or oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). these new blood vessels are known as varices.if the blood pressure rises to a certain level, it can become too high for the varices to cope with, causing the walls of the varices to split and bleed.this can cause long-term bleeding, which can lead toanaemia.alternatively, the bleeding can be rapid and massive, causing you to vomit blood and pass stools that are very dark or tar-like.split varices can be treated by using an endoscope to locate the varices. a tiny band can then be used to seal the base of the varices.a person with portal hypertension may also develop a build-up of fluid in their abdomen (tummy) and around the intestines. this fluid is known as ascites.initially, this can be treated with water tablets (diuretics). if the problem progresses, many litres of fluid can build up, which needs to be drained. this is a procedure known as paracentesis and involves a long, thin tube being placed into the fluid through the skin underlocal anaesthetic.one of the problems associated with the development of ascites is the risk of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). this is a potentially very serious complication and is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure and death.one of the most important functions of the liver is to remove toxins from your blood. if the liver is unable to do this due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the levels of toxins in the blood increase. a high level of toxins in the blood due to liver damage is known as hepatic encephalopathy.symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include: agitation confusion disorientation muscle stiffness muscle tremors difficulty speaking in very serious cases, acomahepatic encephalopathy may require hospital admission. in hospital, body functions are supported and medication is used to remove toxins from the blood.liver damage due to heavy drinking over many years can also increase your risk of developingliver cancer.over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the uk have risen sharply due to increased levels ofalcohol misuse. it’s estimated that, every year, 3-5% of people withcirrhosiswill develop liver cancer. cirrhosis liver transplant lab tests online: liver function test british liver trust',\n",

their lives.they are particularly common in children. some allergies go away as a child gets older, although many are lifelong. adults can develop allergies to things they weren’t previously allergic to.having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon.substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. the more common allergens include: grass and tree pollen – an allergy to these is known ashay fever(allergic rhinitis) dust mites animal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair) food– particularly nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow’s milk insect bites and stings medication – includingibuprofen, aspirin, and

causes the reaction whenever possible.for example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food’s ingredients list for allergens before eating it. the food standards agency has moreinformation about food allergen labelling.there are also several medications available to help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including: antihistamines – these can be taken when you notice the symptoms of a reaction, or before being exposed to an allergen to stop a reaction occurring decongestants– tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids that can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked

redness and swelling caused by an allergic reactionfor some people with very severe allergies, a treatment called immunotherapy may be recommended.this involves being exposed to the allergen in a controlled way over a number of years, so your body gets used to it and doesn’t react to it so severely.read more abouttreating an allergyandavoiding allergic reactions.allergies occur when the body’s immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it’s harmful.it’s not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema.the number of people with allergies is increasing every year. the reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it’s the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with.it’s thought this may cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances.symptoms of an allergic reaction usually develop within a few minutes of being exposed to something you’re allergic to, although occasionally they can develop gradually over a few hours.although allergic reactions can be a nuisance and hamper your normal activities, most are mild. very occasionally, a severe reaction calledanaphylaxiscan occur.common symptoms of an allergic reaction include: sneezing

clear cause.if your allergy is more severe or it’s not obvious what you’re allergic to, your pharmacist may advise you to see your gp as you may need referred for allergy testing at a specialist allergy clinic.the tests that may be carried out are described below.skin prick testing is one of the most common allergy tests.it involves putting a drop of liquid onto your forearm that contains a substance you may be allergic to. the skin under the drop is then gently pricked with a needle. if you are allergic to the substance, an itchy, red bump will appear within 15 minutes.skin prick testing is painless and very safe. make sure you don’t take antihistamines before the test, as they can interfere with the results.blood testsmay be used instead of, or alongside, skin prick tests to help diagnose common allergies.a sample of your blood is removed and analysed for specific antibodies produced by your immune system in response to an allergen.patch tests are used to investigate a type of eczema known as contact dermatitis, which can be caused by your skin being exposed to an allergen.a small amount of the suspected allergen is added to special metal discs, which are then taped to your skin for 48 hours and monitored for a reaction.if you have a suspectedfood allergy, you may be advised to avoid eating a particular food to see if your symptoms improve.after a few weeks, you may then be asked to eat the food again to check if you have another reaction.don’t attempt to do this yourself without discussing it with a qualified healthcare professional.in a few cases, a test called a food challenge may also be used to diagnose a food allergy.during the test, you’re given the food you think you’re allergic to in gradually increasing amounts, to see how you react under close supervision.this test is riskier than other forms of testing, as it could cause a severe reaction, but is the most accurate way to diagnose food allergies. and challenge testing is always carried out in a clinic where a severe reaction can be treated if it does develop.the treatment for an allergy depends on what you’re allergic to. in many cases your pharmacist will be able to offer advice and treatment.they’ll advise you about taking steps to avoid exposure to the substance you’re allergic to, and can recommend medication to control your symptoms.the best way to keep your symptoms under control is often to avoid the things you’re allergic to, although this isn’t always practical.for example, you may be able to help manage: food allergiesby being careful about what you eat animal allergies by keeping pets outside as much as possible and washing them regularly mould allergies by keeping your home dry and well-ventilated, and dealing with any damp and condensation hay feverby staying indoors and avoiding grassy areas when the pollen count is high dust mite allergies by using allergy-proof duvets and pillows, and fitting wooden floors rather than carpetsread more aboutpreventing allergic reactions.medications for mild allergies are available from pharmacies on thepharmacy first scotland servicewithout a prescription, but always ask your pharmacist for advice before starting any new medicine, as they’re not suitable for everyone.antihistamines are the main medicines for allergies. they can be used: as and when you notice the symptoms of an allergic reaction to prevent allergic reactions – for example, you may take them in the morning if you have hay fever and you know the pollen count is high that dayantihistamines can be taken as tablets, capsules, creams, liquids, eye drops or nasal sprays, depending on which part of your body is affected by your allergy.decongestantscan be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose caused by an allergic reaction.they can be taken as tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids. don’t use them for more than a week at a time, as using them for long periods can make your symptoms worse.red and itchy skin caused by an allergic reaction can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter creams and lotions, such as: emollients (moisturising creams) to keep the skin moist and protect it from allergens calamine lotion to reduce itchiness steroids to reduce inflammation (see below)steroid medicationscan help reduce inflammation caused by an allergic reaction. they’re available as: nasal sprays and eye drops for an inflamed nose and eyes creams foreczemaand contact dermatitis inhalers forasthma tablets forhives (urticaria)sprays, drops and weak steroid creams are available without a prescription. stronger creams, inhalers and tablets are available on prescription from your gp.immunotherapy may be an option for a small number of people with certain severe and persistent allergies who are unable to control their symptoms using the measures above.the treatment involves being given occasional small doses of the allergen – either as an injection, or as drops or tablets under the tongue – over the course of several years.the injection can only be performed in a specialist clinic under the supervision of a doctor, as there is a small risk of a severe reaction. the drops or tablets can usually be taken at home.the aim of treatment is to help your body get used to the allergen so it doesn’t react to it so severely. this won’t necessarily cure your allergy, but it will make it milder and mean you can take less medication.some people with severe allergies may experience life-threatening reactions, known asanaphylaxisor anaphylactic shock.if you’re at risk of this, you’ll be given special injectors containing a medicine called adrenaline to use in an emergency.if you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, you should inject yourself in the outer thigh before seeking emergency medical help.read more about thetreating anaphylaxis.the best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the substance that you’re allergic to, although this isn’t always easy or practical.below is some practical advice that should help you avoid the most common allergens.one of the biggest causes of allergies are dust mites, which are tiny insects found in household dust. you can limit the number of mites in your home by: choosing wood or hard vinyl floor coverings instead of a carpet fitting roller blinds that can be easily wiped clean choosing leather, plastic or vinyl furniture instead of upholstered furniture cleaning cushions, soft toys, curtains and upholstered furniture regularly, either by washing (at a high temperature) or vacuuming using tested allergy-proof covers on mattresses, duvets and pillows using a vacuum cleaner fitted with a hepa (high-efficiency particulate air) filter, because it can trap more dust mites than ordinary vacuum cleaners regularly wiping surfaces with a damp, clean cloth – avoid dry dusting, as this can spread dust into the airconcentrate your efforts of controlling dust mites in the areas of

manufacturers must clearly label any foods that contain something that’s known to cause allergic reactions in some people. by carefully checking the label for the list of ingredients, you should be able to avoid an allergic reaction.people with food allergies most often experience an allergic reaction while eating out at a restaurant. you can avoid this by: not relying on the menu description alone (remember, many sauces or dressings could contain allergens) communicating clearly with the waiting staff and asking for their advice avoiding places where there’s a chance that different types of food could come into contact with each other, such as buffets or bakeries let restaurant staff you know your dietary requirements, including how severe your food allergy or intolerance is always

multiple brain functions, including memory.the exact cause of alzheimer’s disease is unknown, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. these include: increasing age a family history of the condition previoussevere head injuries lifestyle factors and conditions associated withcardiovascular diseaseit’s becoming increasingly understood that it’s very common to have both changes of alzheimer’s and vascular dementia together (mixed dementia).read more about thecauses of alzheimer’s diseasealzheimer’s disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years. it affects multiple brain functions.the first sign of alzheimer’s disease is usually minor memory problems. for example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects.as the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as: confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places difficulty planning or making decisions problems with speech and language problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue) low mood or anxietyread more about thesymptoms of alzheimer’s diseasealzheimer’s disease is most common in people over the age of 65, and affects slightly more women than men.the risk of alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80.however, around 1 in every 20 cases of alzheimer’s disease affects people aged 40 to 65.as the symptoms of alzheimer’s disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there’s a problem. many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older.however, a timely diagnosis of alzheimer’s disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help.if you’re worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it’s a good idea to see your gp. if you’re worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.there’s no single test that can be used to diagnose alzheimer’s disease. your gp will ask questions about any problems you are experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions.if alzheimer’s disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist memory service to: discuss the process of making the diagnosis organise testing create a treatment planread more aboutdiagnosing alzheimer’s diseasethere’s no cure for alzheimer’s disease, but medication is available that can help relieve some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition in some people.various other types of support are also available to help people with alzheimer’s live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it’s easier to move around and remember daily tasks.psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability.read more abouttreating alzheimer’s diseaseon average, people with alzheimer’s disease live for around 8 to 10 years after they start to develop symptoms. however, this can vary considerably from person to person. some people with the condition will live longer than this, but others will not.alzheimer’s disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause.as alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. this can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs) which can cause frequent chest infections. it’s also common for people with alzheimer’s disease to eventually have difficulty eating and to have a reduced appetite.there’s increasing awareness that people with alzheimer’s disease needpalliative care. this includes support for families, as well as the person with alzheimer’s.as the exact cause of alzheimer’s disease isn’t clear, there’s no known way to prevent the condition. however, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: stopping smokingandcutting down on alcohol eating ahealthy, balanced dietand maintaining a healthy weight stayingphysically fitand mentally activethese measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health.read more aboutpreventing alzheimer’s diseasethe symptoms of alzheimer’s disease progress slowly over several years. sometimes these symptoms are confused with other conditions and may initially be put down to old age.the rate at which the symptoms progress is different for each individual and it’s not possible to predict exactly how quickly it will get worse.in some cases, infections, medications, strokes or delirium can be responsible for symptoms getting worse. anyone with alzheimer’s disease whose symptoms are rapidly getting worse should be seen by a doctor, so these can be managed.generally, the symptoms of alzheimer’s disease are divided into three main stages.in the early stages, the main symptom of alzheimer’s disease is memory lapses. for example, someone with early alzheimer’s disease may: forget about recent conversations or events, or misplace items forget the names of places and objects, or have trouble thinking of the right word repeat themselves regularly, such as asking the same question several times show poor judgement or find it harder to make decisions become less flexible and more hesitant to try new thingsthere are often signs of mood changes, such as increasinganxietyor agitation, or periods of confusion.as alzheimer’s disease develops, memory problems will get worse. someone with the condition may find it increasingly difficult to remember the names of people they know and may struggle to recognise their family and friends.other symptoms may also develop, such as: increasing confusion and disorientation – for example, getting lost, or wandering and not knowing what time of day it is obsessive, repetitive or impulsive behaviour delusions (believing things that are untrue) or feeling paranoid and suspicious about carers or family members problems with speech or language (aphasia) disturbed sleep changes in mood, such as frequent mood swings,depressionand feeling increasingly anxious, frustrated or agitated difficulty performing spatial tasks, such as judging distances hallucinationsby this stage, someone with alzheimer’s disease usually needs support to help them with their everyday living. for example, they may need help eating, washing, getting dressed and using the toilet.in the later stages of alzheimer’s disease, the symptoms become increasingly severe and distressing for the person with the condition, as well as their carers, friends and family.hallucinations and delusions may come and go over the course of the illness, but can get worse as the condition progresses. sometimes people with alzheimer’s disease can be violent, demanding and suspicious of those around them.a number of other symptoms may also develop as alzheimer’s disease progresses, such as: difficulty eating and swallowing (dysphagia) difficulty changing position or moving around without assistance considerable weight loss – although some people eat too much and put on weight unintentional passing of urine (urinary incontinence)or stools (bowel incontinence) gradual loss of speech significant problems with short- and long-term memoryin the

to find out what the cause may be, and they can refer you to a specialist for more tests, if necessary.read more aboutdiagnosing alzheimer’s diseasealzheimer’s disease is caused by parts of the brain shrinking (atrophy), which affects the structure and function of particular brain areas.it’s not known exactly what causes this process to begin. however, in the brains of people with alzheimer’s disease, scientists have found amyloid plaques (abnormal deposits of protein), neurofibrillary tangles (containing tau) and imbalances in a chemical called acetylcholine.it’s also common to have a degree of vascular damage in the brain.these reduce the effectiveness of healthy neurons (nerve cells that carry messages to and from the brain), gradually destroying them.over time, this damage spreads to several areas of the brain. the first areas affected are responsible for memories.although it’s still unknown what triggers alzheimer’s disease, several factors are known to increase your risk of developing the condition.age is the single most significant factor in the development of alzheimer’s disease. the likelihood of developing the condition doubles every five years after you reach 65 years of age.however, it’s not just older people who are at risk of developing alzheimer’s disease. around 1 in 20 people with the condition are under 65. this is called early onset alzheimer’s disease and it can affect people from around the age of 40.the genes you inherit from your parents can contribute to your risk of developing alzheimer’s disease, although the actual increase in risk is small if you have a close family member with the condition.however, in a few families, alzheimer’s disease is caused by the inheritance of a single gene, and the risks of the condition being passed on are much higher.if several of your family members have developed dementia over the generations, it may be appropriate to seek genetic counselling for information and advice about your chances of developing alzheimer’s disease when you are older.the alzheimer’s society website has more information about thegenetics of dementia.people with down’s syndrome are at a higher risk of developing alzheimer’s disease.this is because the genetic fault that causes down’s syndrome can also cause amyloid plaques to build up in the brain over time, which can lead to alzheimer’s disease in some people.people who have had asevere head injuryhave been found to be at higher risk of developing alzheimer’s disease.research shows that several lifestyle factors and conditions associated withcardiovascular diseasecan increase the risk of alzheimer’s disease.these include: smoking obesity diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterolyou can help reduce your risk by: stopping smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet leading an active life, both physically and mentally losing weight if you need to drinking less alcohol having regular health checks as you get olderread more

future, as well as accessing treatments and support that may help.memory problems aren’t just caused by dementia – they can also be caused by: depressionoranxiety stress medications alcohol or drugs other health problems – such as hormonal disturbances or nutritional deficienciesyour gp can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be. they can then refer you to a specialist for assessment, if necessary.your gp will ask about your concerns and what you or your family have noticed. they’ll also check other aspects of your health, and carry out a physical examination. they may also organise someblood testsand ask about any medication you’re taking to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.you’ll usually be asked some questions and carry out some memory, thinking, and pen and paper tasks to check how different areas of your brain are functioning. this can help your gp decide if you need to be referred to a specialist for more assessments.your gp may refer you to a specialist memory assessment service to help with your diagnosis. memory clinics are staffed by professionals from multiple disciplines who are experts in diagnosing, caring for and advising people with dementia and their families.memory clinic staff can include the following, depending on your local area: a nurse – usually a trained mental health nurse who specialises in diagnosing and caring for people with dementia a psychologist – a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions a psychiatrist – a qualified medical doctor who has training in treating mental health conditions a neurologist – a specialist in treating conditions that affect the nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) a geriatrician – a physician with specialist training in the care of older people a social worker – a trained member of staff able to advise and assist with accessing social services within the local area an occupational therapist – a member of staff with specialist skills in assessing and supporting people with dementia and their families with adjusting to disabilitiesthere’s no simple and reliable test for diagnosing alzheimer’s disease, but the staff will listen to the concerns of both you and your family about your memory or thinking. they will assess your skills and arrange more tests to rule out other conditions.a specialist will usually assess your mental abilities using a special series of questions.one widely used test is the mini mental state examination (mmse). this involves being asked to carry out activities such as memorising a short list of objects correctly and identifying the current day of the week, month and year. different memory clinics may also use other, longer tests.the mmse isn’t used to diagnose alzheimer’s disease, but it’s useful to initially assess areas of difficulty that a person with the condition may have. this helps specialists to make decisions about treatment and whether more tests are necessary.to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and look for possible signs of damage caused by alzheimer’s disease, your specialist may recommend having a brain scan. this could be a: computerised tomography (ct) scan– where several x-rays of your brain are taken at slightly different angles and a computer is used to put the images together magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– where a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of the inside of your brainsome specialist centres offer scans which look at brain function and particular protein deposits. however, at the moment, these are mostly experimental and only used if the diagnosis is unclear.it may take several appointments and tests over months, or even years, before a diagnosis of alzheimer’s disease can be confirmed.for some people, a diagnosis of alzheimer’s disease is a huge shock, especially as it’s not unusual for people with dementia to have less awareness of their difficulties.for others, the diagnosis can be very important in helping them and their families to make sense of symptoms they’ve been concerned about for a long time.if you’ve just been given a diagnosis of dementia, you may be feeling numb, scared and unable to take everything in. it may be helpful to have the diagnosis explained again to help make sense of the idea over time. it might help to talk things through with family and friends.it takes time to adapt to a diagnosis of dementia, for both you and your family. some people find it helpful to seek information and plan for the future, but others may need a longer period to process the news.however, as dementia is a progressive illness, the weeks to months after a diagnosis is often a good time to think about legal, financial and healthcare matters for the future.read more aboutwhat to do if you’ve just been diagnosed with dementiathere’s currently no

someone with the condition cope with everyday life.if you’re diagnosed with alzheimer’s disease, it’s helpful if your health and social care needs are assessed and plans made for the future.a care plan is a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. it involves identifying areas where you may need some assistance, such as: what support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible whether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in whether you need any financial assistancehealthcare professionals (such as your gp or psychiatrist) andsocial care services(which is normally your local council working with the nhs), will usually both be involved in helping draw up and carry out care plans.a number of medications may be prescribed for alzheimer’s disease to help temporarily improve some symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition.donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine (known as ache inhibitors) can be prescribed for people with early to mid-stage alzheimer’s disease. memantine may be prescribed for people with mid-stage disease who cannot take ache inhibitors, or for those with late-stage disease.there’s no difference in how well each of the three different ache inhibitors work, although some people respond better to certain types or have fewer side effects.all of these medications can only be prescribed by specialists such as psychiatrists, neurologists and geriatricians. they may be prescribed by your gp on the advice of a specialist.if you’re caring for someone with alzheimer’s disease, your views should be taken into account when prescribing medication, as well as at regular assessments. these assessments take place to ensure the medication is having a worthwhile effect and to identify and monitor side effects.read guidance from the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) ondonepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease.donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine can cause side effects such as: feeling and being sick dizziness diarrhoea headache agitation insomnia muscle cramps more rarely, slowing of the heartbeat – which can cause issues if you already have problems with your heart rhythm.these side effects are more likely to occur at the beginning of therapy or when the dose is increased. your doctor should review your medical history and your other medications to check the suitability and risk of interactions.common side effects of memantine include: dizziness headaches high blood pressure tiredness constipation shortness of breath more rarely, problems with walking or increased confusion very rarely, seizuresfor more information about the possible side effects of your specific medication, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with it or speak to your doctor.in addition to medication, treatment for alzheimer’s disease involves a wide range of other measures and treatments to help people with dementia live as independently as possible.for example, anoccupational therapistcan identify problems or unsafe areas in your everyday life and help you to develop strategies or use alternative tools to manage these. they may suggest: ways of prompting and reminding yourself of important tasks – such as using diaries or calendars assistive

if you develop any of the above symptoms. while they’re unlikely to be caused by anal cancer, it’s best to get them checked out.your gp will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations.they may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. this involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your bottom so they can feel any abnormalities. your gp will refer you to hospital if they think further tests are necessary.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends in its2015 guidelinesthat gps should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump or anal ulcer. the person should receive an appointment within 2 weeks.if you’re referred to hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions.some of the tests you may have include a: sigmoidoscopy – where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities proctoscopy – where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end biopsy– where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscopeif these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. once these are complete, your doctors will be able to ‘stage’ the cancer. this means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.you can read more about thestages of anal canceron the cancer research uk website.if you’re diagnosed with anal cancer, you’ll be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. this is a team of different specialists who work together to provide the best treatment and care.the main treatments used for anal cancer are: chemoradiation – a combination ofchemotherapyandradiotherapy surgery – to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowelin cases where the cancer has spread and can’t be cured, chemotherapy alone may be considered to help relieve symptoms. this is known aspalliative care.chemoradiation is a treatment that combines chemotherapy (cancer-killing medication) and radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill cancer cells). it’s currently the most effective treatment for anal cancer. you don’t usually need to stay in hospital when you’re having chemoradiation.chemotherapy for anal cancer is usually given in 2 cycles, each lasting 4 to 5 days, with a 4-week gap between the cycles. in many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (picc) in your arm, which can stay in place until your treatment has finished.the tube means you don’t need to stay in hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. however, you’ll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you.a few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and picc.read more abouthow chemotherapy is carried outradiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from monday to

problems long-term (chronic) diarrhoea erectile dysfunction vaginal pain when having sex dry and itchy skin around the groin and anus bleeding from the anus, rectum, vagina or bladdertell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms so they can be investigated and treated.surgery is a less common treatment option for anal cancer. it’s usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily removed, or if chemoradiation hasn’t worked.if the tumour is very small and clearly defined, it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. this is a relatively simple procedure, carried out undergeneral anaesthetic, that usually only requires a stay in hospital of a few days.if chemoradiation has been unsuccessful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended. as with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.an abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. you’ll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery.during the operation, a permanentcolostomywill also be formed to allow you to pass stools. this is where a section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. the stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation.before and after the operation, you’ll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time.read more aboutliving with a colostomyafter your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.to start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll gradually become less frequent over time.the exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. these include: infection withhuman papilloma virus (hpv)– a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body having anal sex or lots of sexual partners – possibly because this increases your risk of

seconds. instructions for how to use these auto-injectors can be found on the side of each device.you should call 999 for an ambulance whether adrenaline has been given or not.if after 5 to 10 minutes the person still feels unwell, a second injection should be given. this should be given in the opposite thigh.a second dose may also be needed if the person improves and then becomes unwell again.the person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table. if they are having difficulty breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier.if the person is unconscious, you should move them to the recovery position – on their side, supported by one leg and one arm, with the head tilted back and the chin lifted. if the person’s breathing or heart stops,cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)should be performed.further treatment will be carried out in hospital.read more abouttreating anaphylaxis.anaphylaxis is the result of your body’s immune system overreacting to a harmless substance, such as food. substances that trigger allergic reactions are known as allergens.anaphylaxis usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen, but sometimes the reaction can happen up to 4 hours later.the most widely reported triggers of anaphylaxis are: insect stings– particularly wasp and bee stings peanuts and tree nuts other types of foods – such as milk and seafood certain medicines – such asantibioticsread more about thecauses of anaphylaxis.if you know what has triggered anaphylaxis, it’s important to take steps to avoid exposure to similar triggers.you should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to either find out your allergy triggers or, if you already know what causes it, for further assessment and advice about how to avoid allergens in the future.you may be given two adrenaline auto-injectors to use during any future episodes of anaphylaxis.read more aboutpreventing anaphylaxis.anaphylaxis is not common, but people of all ages can be affected. people with other allergic conditions, such asasthmaor the allergic skin conditionatopic eczema, are most at risk of developing anaphylaxis.although the condition is life threatening, deaths are rare. there are around 20 deaths in the uk each year. with prompt and proper treatment, most people make a full recovery.anaphylaxis is caused by a problem with the immune system, which is the body’s natural defence against illness and infection.in the case of anaphylaxis, your immune system overreacts to a harmless substance and releases a number of different chemicals, such as histamine, to deal with the mistaken threat.some of the more common triggers for anaphylaxis are shown below.most cases of anaphylaxis are caused by wasp and bee stings, although potentially any insect bite or sting can cause anaphylaxis.it’s estimated around 1 in 100 people will experience an allergic reaction after a wasp or bee sting, but only a small number of these people will go on to develop severe anaphylaxis.more than half of all cases of food-related anaphylaxis are caused by peanuts.other foods known to trigger anaphylaxis include: nuts – such as walnuts, cashew nuts, almonds, brazil nuts and hazelnuts milk fish and shellfish eggs some types of fruit – such as bananas, kiwi fruit, grapes and strawberriesmedicines known to trigger anaphylaxis in a small amount of people include: antibiotics– particularly penicillin-like antibiotics general anaesthetic– muscle-relaxant medicines used during surgery non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)– a type of painkiller that includesibuprofenand aspirinpeople sensitive to these types of medicines will usually develop anaphylaxis as soon as they begin a course of treatment, although they may have safely received them in the past.the risk of anaphylaxis using these types of medicines is very small, so in most cases the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk.for example, the risk of developing anaphylaxis is around: 1 in 1,480 after taking a nsaid-type painkiller 1 in 5,000 after taking penicillin 1 in 10,000 after being given a general anaestheticcontrast agents are a group of special dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of your body show up better on scans such asx-rays.for example, a contrast agent injected into a blood vessel will help show up any problems in the vessel, such as a blockage, on the x-ray. this is known asangiography.the risk of developing anaphylaxis after being injected with a contrast agent is thought to be less than 1 in 10,000.less than 1 in 100 people in the population has a natural rubber latex allergy. healthcare, hair, beauty, catering and motor industry workers are more likely to have a latex allergy.those with a history of hayfever, asthma, eczema, and certain medical conditions, like spina bifida, are more likely to be affected.sometimes, despite extensive testing, no trigger can be found for anaphylaxis, and the cause remains unknown. this is known as idiopathic anaphylaxis.if you think somebody is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, you should use an adrenaline injector if one is available. dial 999 immediately afterwards.call 999 straight away if an adrenaline injector is not available.if you can see a potential trigger, such as a wasp or bee sting stuck in their skin, carefully remove it.adrenaline causes the blood vessels to become narrower, which raises your blood pressure and reduces swelling. it also causes the airways to open, relieving breathing difficulties.an adrenaline injection should be given as soon as a serious reaction is suspected.the signs of suspected anaphylaxis are: problems breathing feeling faint or dizzy loss of consciousnessthe injection can be done by the person with anaphylaxis, but sometimes – if it’s a young child or someone who is unconscious, for example – another person may need to do it.before attempting the injection, make sure you know what to do. you should read all of the instructions carefully when you, or the person you are responsible for, are first prescribed the injector.after injecting, the syringe should be held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. injections can be given through clothing.after injecting the adrenaline, you should immediately dial 999 for an ambulance, even if the person is starting to feel better.most people should experience a rapid improvement in symptoms once the adrenaline has been used.if there’s no improvement after 5 to 10 minutes, you should inject a second dose of adrenaline, if one is available. this should be injected into the opposite thigh.readmedicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) 2014 guidelines on how to use an adrenaline auto-injector (pdf, 188kb).in most cases, the person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table, to help maintain bloodflow to the head and heart.pregnant women should lie down on their left side to avoid putting too much pressure on the large vein that leads to the heart.if the person is conscious but having trouble breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier.if the person is unconscious, check that their airways are open and clear, and also check their breathing. then put them in therecovery positionto make sure they don’t choke on their vomit.place the person on their side, making sure they are supported by one leg and one arm. open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin.if the person’s breathing or heart stops,cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)should be performed.even if adrenaline is given, the person will need to go to hospital for observation – usually for 6 to 12 hours – as symptoms can occasionally return during this period.while in hospital, an oxygen mask can be used to help breathing, and fluids given by an intravenous drip directly into a vein can help increase blood pressure.as well as adrenaline, additional medications such as antihistamines andcorticosteroidscan be used to help relieve symptoms.blood testsmay also be carried out while you’re in hospital to confirm anaphylaxis.you should be able to leave hospital when the symptoms are under control and it’s thought they will not return quickly. this may be after a few hours, but you may have to stay in hospital for a few days if the symptoms were severe.you may be asked to take antihistamines and corticosteroid tablets 2 to 3 days after leaving hospital to help stop your symptoms returning.you will probably be asked to attend a follow-up appointment so you can be given advice about how you can avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis.an adrenaline auto-injector may be given to you for emergency use between leaving hospital and attending the follow-up appointment.read more aboutpreventing anaphylaxis.if you have anaphylaxis, you should be offered advice and medication to help prevent further episodes.you should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic for tests to find out what caused the anaphylaxis. knowing what allergen triggered the allergic reaction can help you avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis.some of the tests commonly used to determine allergies include: a skin prick test – your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of a suspected allergen to see if it reacts by becoming red, raised and itchy a blood test – a sample of your blood is taken to test its reaction to a suspected allergenread more aboutdiagnosing allergies.you may be prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector if you’ve had a previous episode of anaphylaxis and there’s a risk of you having another episode in the future.there are 3 types of auto-injector: epipen jext emeradeeach type is slightly different, and you should make sure you know how to use your auto-injector correctly.you can also ask for a “trainer” kit so you can practise giving yourself or your child injections.the following points are important: carry your auto-injector(s) at all times – there should be no exceptions. it may also be recommended that you get an emergency card or bracelet with full details of your allergy and doctor’s contact details to alert others. extremes of heat can make adrenaline less effective, so don’t leave your auto-injector in the fridge or your car’s glove compartment. check the expiry date regularly. an out-of-date injector will offer limited protection. the manufacturers offer a reminder service, where you can be contacted near the expiry date. check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine for more information. if your child has an auto-injector, they will need to change over to an adult dose once they reach 30kg (approximately 4.5 stone). don’t delay injecting yourself if you think you may be experiencing the beginning of anaphylaxis, even if your initial symptoms are mild. it’s better to use adrenaline early and then find out it was a false alarm than delay treatment until you’re sure you are experiencing severe anaphylaxis.if a trigger has been identified as causing your episode of anaphylaxis, you will need to take steps to avoid it in the future.you can reduce the chances of being exposed to a food allergen by: checking food labels letting staff at a restaurant know what you’re allergic to, so it’s not included in your meal remembering that some types of food may contain small traces of potential allergens – for example, some sauces contain wheat and peanutssee our page onliving with a food allergyfor more information.you can reduce your risk of being stung by an insect by taking basic precautions, such as: moving away from wasps, hornets or bees slowly without panicking – don’t wave your arms around or swat at them using an insect repellent if you spend time outdoors, particularly in the summersome specialist allergy centres also offer special treatment to help desensitise you to insect stings if you are at a particularly high risk of a further sting – for example, if you are a beekeeper or gardener.read more aboutpreventing insect stings.if you’re allergic to certain types of medicines, there are normally alternatives that can be safely used. for example, if you’re allergic to: penicillin – you can normally safely take a different group ofantibioticsknown as macrolides non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such asibuprofenand aspirin – you can normally safely takeparacetamol, but read the ingredients of things like colds medicines carefully to make sure they don’t contain nsaids one type ofgeneral anaesthetic– others are available, or it

blockers, can be usedalways tell any healthcare professional about medicine allergies you have, as they may not be aware of them.there may be times when it’s necessary to use contrast agents – for example, if you had bleeding inside your brain – even if this places you at risk of anaphylaxis.in such circumstances, you can be given injections of antihistamines andcorticosteroidsbefore the

       " 'Angina': 'angina is chest pain which occurs when the blood supply to the heart becomes restricted because of narrowing or blockages in the blood vessels around the heart.the main symptom of angina is chest pain. this can: feel like a dull pain, ache, ‘heavy’ or ‘tight’ feeling in your chest spread to your arms, neck, jaw or back be triggered by physical exertionangina itself is not life threatening, but prolonged chest pain can be a symptom of a heart attack.you or someone else has symptoms like: central chest pain or discomfort in the chest that doesn’t go away – it may feel like pressure, tightness or squeezing pain that radiates down the left arm, or both arms, or to the neck, jaw, back or stomach unconsciousness seizures or fitting difficulty breathing (snoring or rasping) chest pain alongside breathlessness, nausea and sweating do not have a diagnosis of angina and experience chest pain on exercise that eases after a few minutes of resting have an angina diagnosis and your symptoms are becoming more frequent or occur at restif your gp is closed, phone 111.to diagnose angina, you will be assessed and you may need to have several tests.you will also be asked some questions about: the symptoms you experienced if there were any triggers for the pain your family’s medical history lifestyle risk factors (like smoking, for example)you might also be given some tests to determine if you already have heart disease or you’re at risk of it. measuring your weight measuring blood pressure taking blood to check cholesterol levels, diabetes or anaemiaif it’s thought that you have angina, you might be referred to the hospital for some more tests. these might include: electrocardiogram (ecg)– measures the rhythms and electrical activity of the heart exercise tolerance test (ett) – measures the activity of the heart during exercise myocardial perfusion scan (mps or myoview) – measures how well blood is reaching the heart coronary angiography– shows whether your coronary arteries are narrow and how severe any blockages are blood tests–help to identify increased enzyme levels (troponin) which are released when the heart is damagedthe 2 main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina.stable angina is more common. attacks are more likely to have a trigger (like physical activity or stress).symptoms of stable angina usually only last for a few minutes after exercise or stress. they can improve with rest and by taking a medication called glyceryl trinitrate (gtn).attacks of unstable angina can be unpredictable and develop without any clear triggers. they might also last longer and continue even when resting.sometimes, when chest pain occurs suddenly, it’s unclear if it’s due to unstable angina or a heart attack. until tests confirm the diagnosis, doctors sometimes call this acute coronary syndrome (acs).there are various ways to treat and manage angina.if you have stable angina you may be given medicine to: prevent and treat angina attacks reduce your risk of a heart attackyou may be given nitrates if you have stable angina. these work by relaxing the muscles in the blood vessels so that blood can pass through more easily.you might be given nitrates as: slow release tablets a fast acting spray or tabletglyceryl trinitrate (gtn) is usually given in a fast acting spray or tablets. you should keep this with you at all times. if you experience an episode of angina you can use the spray or tablet under your tongue. the pain should then ease within a few minutes.you can repeat the dose after 5 minutes if the pain has not gone away. if the pain has still not gone 5 minutes after you take the second dose you should call an ambulance.beta blockers work mainly by slowing down the heart.calcium channel blockers relax the arteries, increasing blood supply to the heart muscle.if you cannot have beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, you may be given another medicine. your doctor will discuss this with you.to reduce your risk of more serious cardiovascular problems, your doctor might give you: a low dose ofaspirinto prevent blood clots statinsto reduce your cholesterol (blood fats) level ace inhibitors to reduce your blood pressureworsening angina symptoms over a short period of time can be a sign of a more acute coronary syndrome and you should seek urgent medical advice by phoning 999.if you have unstable angina (where symptoms develop unpredictably), you’ll need certain medicines. these will prevent blood clots and reduce your risk of having a heart attack.you may be given: low-dose aspirin clopidogrel ticagrelorsurgery may be recommended if you continue to have angina attacks despite medical treatment. it may also be recommended if tests show that you’re at a high risk of having a heart attack.there are 2 types of procedures that are used to treat angina. these are a: coronary artery bypass graft (cabg) percutaneous coronary intervention (pci)the best option for you depends on your circumstances. you should discuss the different options with your doctor. it’s likely that you will need to continue taking some medicines after surgery.a cabg is where a section of a blood vessel is taken from another part of the body. this is then used to re-route the flow of blood past a blocked or narrow section of artery.pci is where a narrowed section of artery is widened using a balloon and a tiny tube called a stent. it’s also known as a coronary angioplasty. breathlessness intervention service british heart foundation: angina chest heart & stroke scotland: angina',\n",
       " 'Angioedema': 'angioedema is the swelling of the deeper layers of the skin, caused by a build-up of fluid.the symptoms of angioedema can affect any part of the body, but swelling usually affects the: eyes lips genitals hands feetmany people with angioedema also experienceurticaria (hives). this is a raised, red and itchy rash that appears on the skin.the cause of angioedema depends on the type you have. there are 4 main types of angioedema: allergic angioedema – the swelling is caused by an allergic reaction, such as a reaction to peanuts, and sometimes occurs in combination withanaphylaxis idiopathic angioedema – there is no known cause for the swelling (although certain factors, such as stress or infection, may trigger the symptoms) drug-induced angioedema – the swelling is a side effect of certain medications, most often angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors hereditary angioedema – the swelling is caused by “faulty” genes that are inherited from a person’s parentsread more about thecauses of angioedema.angioedema is a common condition, affecting about 10-20% of people during their life, although some types are more common than others.hereditary angioedema is rare, only affecting between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 people worldwide.your doctor can diagnose angioedema by examining the affected skin and discussing symptoms.however, further tests, such asblood testsor allergy tests, may be required to determine the type of angioedema.idiopathic angioedema is only diagnosed if no cause can be found.read more aboutdiagnosing angioedema.although most cases of angioedema get better without treatment after a few days, medication is often used.for cases of allergic and idiopathic angioedema, antihistamines andoral steroids (steroid tablets)can be used to relieve the swelling.drug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to treat whatever underlying condition you have.although the condition cannot be cured, regular drug treatment can prevent attacks in people with hereditary angioedema.read more abouttreating angioedema.the main sign of angioedema is swelling that develops below the skin’s surface.the swelling is caused by a collection of fluid in the deep layers of the skin.it most often affects the hands, feet, eyes, lips, or genitals. in severe cases, the inside lining of the throat and bowel can be affected (see below).the swelling usually appears suddenly, and is more severe than normal hives (nettle rash). it commonly lasts 1 to 3 days. there may be a prickling sensation in the affected area before swelling is visible.the swelling is not itchy and the skin may look a normal colour; however, many people with allergic or idiopathic angioedema also developurticaria (hives), which is red and itchy.as well as visible swellings, angioedema can cause other symptoms, including: a hot or painful sensation in the swollen areas swelling of the inside of the throat, the windpipe and the tongue, making breathing difficult swelling of the conjunctiva (the transparent layer of cells that cover the white part of the eye), which affects visionpeople with hereditary angioedema may also experience: abdominal (stomach) pain caused by swelling in the stomach and bowel, which can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea swelling of the bladder or urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the genitals), which can cause bladder problems and difficulty passing urinecontact your gp if you have an episode of angioedema that does not affect your breathing and you have not previously been diagnosed with the condition. you will need to have tests to determine what type of angioedema you have.dial 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you, or someone you know, is experiencinganaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction). tell the operator that you suspect anaphylaxis.initial symptoms of anaphylaxis include: a feeling of tightness in the chest that leads to breathing problems swelling of the tongue and throatif you, or the person in your care, has previously been prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector pen, you should use it while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.angioedema is often caused by a problem with the immune system, although there are many cases where no cause can be identified.normally, your immune system protects your body from illness and infection by attacking germs in your body.in allergic angioedema, your immune system mistakenly attacks harmless substances in your blood. your body produces the chemical histamine, which causes the blood vessels in the area to expand, leading to swelling of the skin.substances known to trigger allergic angioedema include: certain types of food – particularly nuts, shellfish, milk and eggs some types of medication – such as penicillin, aspirin andnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such as ibuprofen insect bites and stings– particularly wasp and bee stings latex – a naturally occurring rubber used to make medical gloves, balloons andcondomscases of angioedema without an identifiable cause are known as idiopathic angioedema. it may be that a problem with the immune system sometimes causes it to “misfire”.in cases of idiopathic angioedema, certain triggers may lead to swelling, such as: anxiety or stress minor infections hot or cold temperatures exerciseavoiding these triggers whenever possible may improve your symptoms.some medications can cause angioedema. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, which are used to treathigh blood pressure (hypertension), are usually responsible.it’s estimated that around 1-5% of people taking ace inhibitors will develop drug-induced angioedema. black people being treated with ace inhibitors are 3 to 4 times more likely to develop this side effect than white people.around 1 in 4 cases of drug-induced angioedema occurs during the first month of taking an ace inhibitor. the remaining cases develop many months or even years after treatment begins.while they are useful in lowering blood pressure, ace inhibitors can sometimes disrupt the “chemical balance” and trigger an episode of severe swelling.less common causes of drug-induced angioedema include: bupropion – a medication that helps people togive up smoking vaccines selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)– a type of antidepressant cox-ii inhibitors – a type of painkiller used to treat chronic pain conditions such asarthritis nsaids – a type of painkiller, such as aspirin oribuprofen angiotensin-2 receptor antagonists – another medication used to treat high blood pressure statins– used to treat people withhigh cholesterol levels proton pump inhibitors (ppis) – used to treatstomach ulcershereditary angioedema is caused by a genetic mutation (a change in the dna) in the c1 esterase inhibitor (c1-inh) gene. genes are single units of genetic material that code for characteristics such as eye and hair colour.as a result of the mutated c1-inh gene, the body does not make enough c1-inh protein. this protein plays an important role in regulating the immune system. without enough c1-inh protein, the immune system can misfire and trigger the symptoms of angioedema.certain things are thought to trigger hereditary angioedema, such as: trauma – including surgery or infection the oral contraceptive pill pregnancythe mutated c1-inh gene is passed down through families. if you have hereditary angioedema, you have a 50% chance of passing it on to your children.angioedema is usually diagnosed by your doctor examining the affected skin and discussing your symptoms.it can be difficult to find the exact cause and identify which type of angioedema you have. there is no single test available, but you may have allergy tests or blood tests if a specific cause is suspected.you’re likely to be asked if you have recently been exposed to any allergy-causing substances, such as nuts or latex. you may also be asked whether you have a history of other allergic conditions, such asurticaria (hives)orasthma. people with an allergic condition often develop other allergic conditions.tell your doctor about any medications you are taking, including over-the-counter medication, such as painkillers, herbal supplements and vitamins.your gp may recommend that you keep a diary of your exposure to possible irritants – or a food diary, if a food allergy is suspected.if allergic angioedema is suspected, you are likely to be referred to a specialist allergy or immunology clinic for further testing. tests may include: a skin prick test – your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of the suspected allergen to see whether there is a reaction ablood test– a sample of your blood is tested to determine whether your immune system reacts to a suspected allergenread more aboutdiagnosing allergies.if you are taking a medication known to cause drug-induced angioedema, your gp will withdraw that medication and prescribe an alternative. you should not stop taking any prescribed medication without advice from a health professional.if you don’t have any further episodes of angioedema, a diagnosis of drug-induced angioedema can be made.hereditary angioedema can be diagnosed using a blood test to check the level of proteins regulated by the c1-inh gene. a very low level would suggest hereditary angioedema.the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema is highly specialised and should be carried out in a specialist immunology clinic.idiopathic angioedema is usually confirmed by a “diagnosis of exclusion”. this means a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema can only be made after all the above tests have been carried out and a cause has not been found.as angioedema can be associated with other medical problems – such as an iron deficiency, liver diseases and problems with the thyroid gland – your doctor or specialist will undertake some simple blood tests to check for these conditions.medication is the main treatment for angioedema, although many cases get better after a few days without treatment.allergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema are usually treated in the same way, using a combination of antihistamines andcorticosteroidsto help relieve the swelling.drug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to the one causing your symptoms.if you also had symptoms of anaphylaxis during an episode of angioedema, you will probably be given an adrenaline auto-injector pen in case your symptoms return.read more abouttreating anaphylaxis.hereditary angioedema cannot be cured and does not respond to adrenaline, antihistamines or steroids, so a preventative approach is taken. a number of different medications are used to stabilise the protein levels in your blood to help prevent symptoms developing.antihistamines work by blocking the effects of a protein called histamine, which is one of the chemicals responsible for causing your skin to swell.a 2-week course of a non-sedating type of antihistamine (which does not cause drowsiness) is usually recommended – these include fexofenadine and cetirizine. cetirizine can be bought over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription.antihistamines can also be given by injection at hospital or your gp surgery.if you also haveurticaria (hives)and are being kept awake at night by itchy skin, your gp may prescribe an older type of antihistamine to take before going to bed. these types cause drowsiness and should help you sleep.a minority of people will still experience drowsiness after taking the newer type of antihistamines. if you find yourself feeling drowsy, you should avoid: driving drinking alcohol operating complex or heavy machineryother side effects of the newer antihistamines include: headache dry mouth dry nosethese side effects are usually short-lived and should pass quickly.corticosteroids (steroids)work by blocking many of your immune system’s actions. in most cases, a 3 to 5 day course of steroid tablets is recommended. a steroid called prednisolone is the preferred choice.side effects of prednisolone include: nausea abdominal (stomach) pain tiredness oral thrush– a fungal infection inside your mouth dizzinessif you feel dizzy after taking prednisolone, avoid driving and operating heavy machinery. these side effects should pass once you finish the course of treatment.steroid injections may be needed for more severe cases of angioedema. these are usually administered in hospitals or at specialist clinics by an allergy specialist or immunologist (a doctor who specialises in treating conditions that affect the immune system).the medication used to treat hereditary angioedema falls into 1 of 2 categories: medication used to prevent angioedema medication used to relieve symptomsdanazol is a synthetic hormone that is effective in preventing the symptoms of angioedema because it helps boost levels of the c1-inh protein.however, danazol can cause a number of unpleasant side effects if used on a long-term basis. for example, it may cause: weight gain depression disruption to the menstrual cycle – such as irregular periods or absent periods high blood pressure in women, changes to the body that are usually associated with men – such as excessive body hair growth, flattening of the chest, deepening of the voice and an increase in muscle tone liver problemsdue to these side effects, many people with hereditary angioedema are uneasy about using danazol on a long-term basis. stanozolol is a similar medication that is slightly better tolerated.tranexamic acid is also an alternative medication to danazol. it can be as effective as danazol, but does not cause as many side effects and is preferred for use in women.icatibant is a relatively new medication used to treat acute (short-lasting) episodes of swelling. it works by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals that are responsible for causing the swelling in cases of hereditary angioedema.icatibant is given by injection under the skin, and a second injection is often required.common side effects of icatibant include: adverse skin reactions at the site of the injection – such as pain, redness, swelling or itchiness itchiness in other areas of the skin dizzinesspurified c1-inhibitor concentrate is widely used to replace the missing protein in the blood. it’s needed for patients undergoing surgery, to prevent attacks caused by surgical trauma. it’s used to treat acute attacks and is injected directly into the vein.many patients will keep supplies of their concentrate at home for emergency use.icatibant and c1-inhibitor concentrate will be prescribed by the specialist immunology unit caring for the patient with hereditary angioedema.',\n",

slowly worse.read more about thesymptoms of ankylosing spondylitisyou should see your gp if you have persistent symptoms of as.if your gp thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment.read more aboutdiagnosing ankylosing spondylitis.in as, various areas of the spine and other joints become inflamed.as well as causing pain, stiffness and swelling, this inflammation can damage affected areas of the body over time, and in some cases can lead to some of the individual bones of the spine fusing (joining together). this fusing of the spine is known as ankylosis.it is not known what causes the condition, but there is thought to be a link with a particular gene known as hla-b27.read more about thecauses of ankylosing spondylitis.as tends to first develop in teenagers and young adults. most cases first start in people aged 20-30, with only a minority of cases first affecting adults over 45.as is around three times more common in men than in women.there are around 200,000 people in the uk who have been diagnosed with the condition.there is no cure for as and it is not possible to reverse the damage caused by the condition. however, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help prevent or delay its progression.in most cases, treatment will involve a combination of: exercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness physiotherapy – where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility medication to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation – such as painkillers and a type of medicine called anti-tnf medicationsurgery is sometimes needed to repair significantly damaged joints or correct severe bends in the spine, but this is uncommon.read more abouttreating ankylosing spondylitis.the outlook for as is highly variable. for some people, the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others the condition can get progressively worse over time.around 70-90% of people with as remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term. however, some people eventually become severely disabled due to the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees.with modern treatments, as doesn’t normally affect life expectancy significantly, although the condition is associated with an increased risk of other potentially life-threatening problems.for example, as can lead toosteoporosis(weakening of the bones), spinal fractures andcardiovascular disease(a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels).read more about thecomplications of

may find: the pain gets better with exercise but doesn’t improve, or gets worse, with rest the pain and stiffness is worse in the morning and at night – you may wake up regularly during the night because of the pain you have pain in the area around your buttocksas well as causing symptoms in your back and spine, as can also cause inflammation of the joints (arthritis) in other parts of your body, such as your hips and knees. the main symptoms associated with arthritis are: pain on moving the affected joint tenderness when the affected joint is examined swelling and warmth in the affected areaenthesitis is painful inflammation where a bone is joined to a tendon (a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) or a ligament (a band of tissue that connects bones to bones).common sites for enthesitis are: at the top of the shin bone behind the heel (achilles tendon) under the heel where the ribs join to the breast boneif your ribs are affected, you may experience chest pain, and you may find it difficult to expand your chest when breathing deeply.fatigue is a common symptom of untreated as. it can make you feel tired and lacking in energy.you should see your gp if you have persistent symptoms of as.if your gp thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment.read more aboutdiagnosing ankylosing spondylitis.in ankylosing spondylitis (as), several parts of the lower spine become inflamed, including the vertebrae (bones in the spine) and spinal joints.over time, this can damage the spine and lead to the growth of new bone, which in some cases can cause parts of the spine to join up (fuse) and lose flexibility. this is known as ankylosis.it is not known exactly what causes as, but in many cases there seems to be a link with a particular gene known as hla-b27.research has shown that more than 9 out of 10 people with as carry a particular gene known as human leukocyte antigen b27 (hla-b27).having this gene does not necessarily mean you will develop as. it is estimated that 8 in every 100 people in the general population have the hla-b27 gene, but most do not have as.it is thought that having this gene may make you more vulnerable to developing as, and the condition is triggered by one or more environmental factors – although it is not known what these are.testing for this gene may be carried out if as is suspected. however, this test is not a very reliable method of diagnosing the condition because some people can have the hla-b27 gene but not have ankylosing spondylitis.read abouthow ankylosing spondylitis is diagnosed.as can run in families, and the hla-b27 gene can be inherited from another family member.if you have as and tests have shown you carry the hla-b27 gene, the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 20%. if you have as but don’t carry the hla-b27 gene, the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 10%.if you have a close relative who has as, such as a parent or a sibling (brother or sister), you are three times more likely to develop the condition compared with someone who does not have a relative with the condition.ankylosing spondylitis (as) can be difficult to diagnose because the condition develops slowly and there is no definitive test to confirm a diagnosis.the first thing you should do if you think you have as is to see your gp. they will ask about your symptoms, including what symptoms you are experiencing, when they started and how long you have had them.back pain associated with as can be quite distinctive. for example, it usually doesn’t improve with rest and may wake you up during the night.if your gp suspects as, they may arrangeblood teststo check for signs of inflammation in your body. inflammation in your spine and joints is one of the main symptoms of the condition.if your results suggest you do have inflammation, you will be referred to a rheumatologist for further tests. a rheumatologist is a specialist in conditions that affect muscles and joints.your rheumatologist will carry out imaging tests to examine the appearance of your spine and pelvis, as well as further blood tests. these are described below.anx-rayof your lower back can show damage to the joints at the base of your spine (the sacroiliac joints) and new bone forming between the vertebrae (bones in your spine), which are common signs of advanced as.amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanmay highlight changes in your sacroiliac joints that might not show up on an x-ray. it may also show any inflammation of ligaments in the spinal region.anultrasound scancan pick up inflammation of the tissues (tendons and ligaments) attached to your bones.a genetic blood test may sometimes be carried out to see if you carry the hla-b27 gene, which is found in most people with as.this can contribute towards a diagnosis of as, but it is not entirely reliable as not everyone with the condition has this gene, and some people have the gene without ever developing as.although scans can sometimes show spinal inflammation and fusing of the spine (ankylosis), damage to the spine cannot always be picked up in the early stages of as.this is why diagnosis is often difficult. in many cases, confirming a diagnosis is a long process that can take years.a diagnosis of as can usually be confirmed if an x-ray shows sacroiliitis (inflammation of the sacroiliac joints) and you have at least one of the following: at least three months of lower back pain that gets better with exercise and doesn’t improve with rest limited movement in your lumbar spine (lower back) limited chest expansion compared to what is expected for your age and sexif you have all three of these features but do not have sacroiliitis – or if you only have sacroiliitis – you will be diagnosed with “probable ankylosing spondylitis”.there is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis (as), but treatment is available to help relieve the symptoms.treatment can also help delay or prevent the process of the spine fusing (joining up) and stiffening.in most cases, treatment will involve a combination of exercise, physiotherapy and medication, which are described below.keeping active can improve your posture and range of spinal movement, along with preventing your spine from becoming stiff and painful.as well as keeping active, physiotherapy is a key part of treating as. a physiotherapist (a healthcare professional trained in using physical methods of treatment) can advise about the most effective exercises and draw up an exercise programme that suits you.types of physiotherapy recommended for as include: a group exercise programme – where you exercise with others an individual exercise programme – you are given exercises to do by yourself massage – your muscles and other soft tissues are manipulated to relieve pain and improve movement (the bones of the spine should never be manipulated as this can cause injury in people with as) hydrotherapy – exercise in water (usually a warm, shallow swimming pool or a special hydrotherapy bath); the buoyancy of the water helps make movement easier by supporting you, and the warmth can relax your musclessome people prefer to swim or play sport to keep flexible. this is usually fine, although some daily stretching and exercise is also important.if you’re ever in doubt, speak to your physiotherapist or rheumatologist before taking up a new form of sport or exercise.thenational ankylosing spondylitis society (nass)provides detailed information about different types of exercise to help you manage your condition.you may need painkillers to manage your condition while you are being referred to a rheumatologist. the rheumatologist may continue prescribing painkillers, although not everyone needs them all the time.the first type of painkiller usually prescribed is anon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). as well as helping to ease pain, nsaids can help relieve swelling (inflammation) in your joints.examples of nsaids includeibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac.when prescribing nsaids, your gp or rheumatologist will try to find the one that suits you, and the lowest possible dose that relieves your symptoms. your dose will be monitored and reviewed as necessary.if nsaids are unsuitable for you, an alternative painkiller, such asparacetamol, may be recommended.paracetamol rarely causes side effects and can be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. however, paracetamol may not be suitable for people with liver problems or those dependent on alcohol.if necessary, as well as paracetamol, you may also be prescribed a stronger type of painkiller called codeine.codeine can cause side effects including feeling sick, vomiting,constipationand drowsiness.if your symptoms cannot be controlled using painkillers or exercising and stretching, anti-tnf (tumour necrosis factor) medication may be recommended. tnf is a chemical produced by cells when tissue is inflamed.anti-tnf medications are given by injection and work by preventing the effects of tnf, as well as reducing inflammation in your joints caused by ankylosing spondylitis.examples of anti-tnf medication include adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab.these are relatively new treatments for as, and their long-term effects are unknown.however, they have been used for longer in people withrheumatoid arthritis, and this is providing clearer information about their long-term safety.if your rheumatologist recommends using anti-tnf medication, the decision about whether they are right for you must be discussed carefully and your progress will be closely monitored. this is because anti-tnf medication can interfere with the immune system (the body’s natural defence system), increasing your risk of developing potentially serious infections.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has produced guidance about the use of anti-tnf medication for as. nice states that adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab may only be used if: yourdiagnosis of ankylosing spondylitishas been confirmed your level of pain is assessed twice (using a simple scale that you fill in) 12 weeks apart and confirms your condition has not improved yourbath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (basdai)is tested twice, 12 weeks apart, and confirms your condition has not improved – basdai is a set of measures devised by experts to evaluate your condition, by asking a number of questions about your symptoms treatment with two or more nsaids for four weeks at the highest possible dose has not controlled your symptomsafter 12 weeks of treatment with anti-tnf medication, your pain score and basdai will be tested again to see whether they have improved enough to make continuing treatment worthwhile. if they have, treatment will continue and you will be tested every 12 weeks.if there is not enough improvement after 12 weeks, you will be tested again at a later date or the treatment will be stopped.corticosteroidshave a powerful anti-inflammatory effect and can be taken as tablets or injections by people with as.if a particular joint is inflamed, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the joint. after the injection, you will need to rest the joint for up to 48 hours.it is usually considered wise to have a corticosteroid injection up to three times in one year, with at least three months between injections in the same joint. this is because corticosteroids injections can cause a number of side effects, such as: infection in response to the injection the skin around the injection may change colour (depigmentation) the surrounding tissue may waste away a tendon (cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) near the joint may rupture (burst)corticosteroids may also calm down painful swollen joints when taken as tablets.disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) are an alternative type of medication often used to treat other types of arthritis.dmards may be prescribed for as, although they are only beneficial in treating pain and inflammation in joints in areas of the body other than the spine.two dmards sometimes used to treat inflammation of joints other than the spine include sulfasalazine and methotrexate.most people with as will not need surgery.however, in cases where a joint has become severely damaged, joint replacement surgery may be recommended to improve pain and movement in the affect joint. for example, if the hip joints are affected, ahip replacementmay be carried out.in rare cases, corrective surgery may be needed if the spine becomes badly bent.as the symptoms of as develop slowly and tend to come and go, you will need to see your rheumatologist or gp for regular check-ups.they will make sure your treatment is working properly and may carry out physical assessments to assess how your condition is progressing. this may involve further sets of the same blood tests or x-rays you had at the time of your diagnosis.anycomplications of ankylosing spondylitisthat arise will be treated as they develop.ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a complex condition that can affect many parts of your body. it can cause complications in your day-to-day life and lead to additional health conditions.some complications associated with as are outlined below.although most people with as remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term, around 4 in every 10 people with the condition will eventually have severely restricted movement in their spine.this usually only affects the lower back and is the result of the bones in the spine fusing (joining up).fusing of the spine can make it difficult to move your back and can mean your posture becomes fixed in one position, although it doesn’t lead to severe disability in most cases.in rare cases, surgery may be recommended to correct severe bends in the spine.as can cause joints such as the hips and knees to become inflamed. this can damage the affected joints over time, making them painful and difficult to move.if a joint becomes particularly damaged, you may need surgery to replace it with an artificial one.iritis, also known as anterior uveitis, is a condition sometimes associated with as where the front part of the eye becomes red and swollen. it usually only affects one eye, rather than both.if you have iritis, your eye may become red, painful and sensitive to light (photophobia). your vision may also become blurred or cloudy.you should visit your gp as soon as possible if you have as and think you may have developed iritis, as the condition can cause the loss of some or all of your vision if not treated promptly.if your gp thinks you have iritis, they will refer you urgently to an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specialises in eye problems) for treatment.iritis can usually be treated withcorticosteroideye drops.osteoporosisis where the bones become weak and brittle. in as, osteoporosis can develop in the spine and can increase your risk of fracturing the bones in your backbone. the longer you have the condition, the more this risk increases.if you do develop osteoporosis, you will usually need to take medication to help strengthen your bones. there are a number of medications that can be used to treat osteoporosis, which can be taken by mouth (orally) as tablets or given by injection.read more abouttreating osteoporosis.if you have as, you may also have an increased risk of developingcardiovascular disease (cvd). cvd is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such asheart diseaseandstroke.due to this increased risk, it is important to take steps to minimise your chances of developing cvd.your rheumatologist (a specialist in treating muscle and joint conditions) can advise about lifestyle changes you should make to minimise your risk of developing a cvd. these changes may include: stopping smoking– if you smoke losing weight– if you are overweight or obese taking regular exercise– 150 minutes of exercise per week can greatly increase your health making changes to your diet to keep other conditions you may have under control – such asdiabetesorhigh blood pressureyou may also be prescribed medication to reduce your blood pressure or blood cholesterol level.cauda equina syndrome is a very rare complication of as that occurs when nerves at the bottom of your spine become compressed (compacted).cauda equina syndrome causes: pain or numbness in your lower back and buttocks weakness in your legs – which can affect your ability to walk urinary incontinenceor bowel incontinence (when you cannot control your bladder or bowels)see your gp as soon as possible if you have as and you develop any of these symptoms.in very rare cases, it is possible to develop a condition called amyloidosis as a complication of as.amyloid is a protein produced by cells in your bone marrow (the spongy material found in the centres of some hollow bones). amyloidosis is a condition where amyloid builds up in organs such as your heart, kidneys and liver.amyloidosis can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, fluid retention (oedema),shortness of breathand numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.over time, as can increasingly affect your ability to work. some people with the condition may be unable to work at all and others may need changes to their working life, such as working part-time, working from home or avoiding physically demanding work.when at work, it is important to maintain a good posture when sitting or standing for long periods of time. you should get up, stretch and move around regularly. this could mean adjusting your work station or ensuring you take regular breaks. pain concern versus

       " 'Anorexia nervosa': 'anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder. it’s a serious, potentially life-threatening, mental health condition.people who have anorexia are very anxious about their weight and body shape. they try to keep their weight as low as possible by strictly controlling what they eat. many people with anorexia will also exercise excessively.they may also use other methods to try to control their weight, like usinglaxatives, vomiting after eating, and taking stimulant drugs.signs and symptoms of anorexia include:restricting your food intake means your body isn’t getting enough energy or nutrition. this can lead to other physical symptoms.eating too little for a long time can cause physical symptoms, like: fine downy hair (lanugo) growing on the body more hair on the face pubic hair becoming sparse and thin slow or irregular heartbeatpeople with anorexia may also: have pain in their abdomen (tummy) feel bloated orconstipated have swelling in their feet, hands or face feel very tired have low blood pressure (hypotension) feel cold or have a low body temperature feel light-headed or dizzyin children with anorexia, puberty and the associated growth spurt may be delayed. they may gain less weight than expected for someone going through puberty. they might be shorter than other people of the same age.if you get periods and you have anorexia, your periods may stop. anorexia can also lead to infertility, for both men and women. an eating problem anorexiabeat has more information about treatment for anorexiaif someone close to you is showing signs of anorexia, you can offer help and support.you could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. you could also offer to help by going with the person to see their gp.if you’d like to get some advice on how to help, a healthcare professional, such as your own gp, can provide information on: how to help the person recognise that they have a problem the treatments available how you can support them during their treatmentyou could also get help from a support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders.beat has more information about how to support someone with anorexiawhen making a diagnosis, your gp will probably ask questions about your weight and eating habits.for example, they might: ask if you’ve lost a lot of weight recently or quite quickly ask how you feel about your weight, and if you’re concerned about it ask if you make yourself vomit regularly check if you have periods, whether your periods have stopped and if so, for how long check your weight check your pulse and blood pressure do a blood testit’s important to answer these questions honestly. your gp isn’t trying to judge you. they just need to accurately assess your symptoms.if your gp thinks you may have anorexia, they’ll refer you to a specialist in eating disorders for a more detailed assessment. your gp sometimes carries out this assessment.treatment for anorexia usually involves a combination of: talking therapy, and supervised weight gainit’s important to start treatment as early as possible to reduce the risk of serious complications.treatment for anorexia is slightly different for adults and those under 18 years old.if someone has anorexia for a long time, it can lead to severe complications and health problems. these can sometimes be permanent.people with anorexia have an increased risk of: poor circulation and cardiovascular problems heart conditions, like coronary heart disease and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) health problems caused bymalnutrition– a lack of vitamins and mineralsanorexia can cause an imbalance of minerals in the blood, like potassium, calcium and sodium. these minerals help keep you healthy. when there’s an imbalance, it can cause symptoms like: tiredness weakness dehydration fits irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) muscle spasms confusionother conditions that can be caused by anorexia and malnutrition can include: low blood pressure (hypotension) anaemia dental problems, liketooth decaycaused by regular vomiting low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) acute kidney (renal) failure liver damage heart failure osteoporosis (fragile bones) and loss of muscle strength, particularly in women and girls loss of sex drive(libido) andimpotencyin menmisuse of laxatives can damage the bowels and cause permanent constipation.anorexia can lead to irregular menstrual cycles (periods), or cause your periods to stop altogether. this doesn’t mean anorexia makes you infertile.if you have anorexia, even if your periods are irregular or have stopped, you should continue to use birth control if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.if you have anorexia and are trying to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your gp and care team.anorexia during pregnancy can increase the risk of complications, like: miscarriage giving birth early (premature birth) having a baby with a low birth weightyou’re also likely to need extra care and support during pregnancy if you have previously had anorexia and

different issue.your gp will ask you about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions.everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life. for example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, or having a job interview.during times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal.but some people find it hard to control their worries. their feelings of anxiety are more constant and often affect their daily lives.anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including: panic disorder phobias post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) social anxiety disorder (social phobia)the information on this page is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (gad).gad can cause a change in your behaviour and the way you think and feel about things. it can also cause physical changes. this results in symptoms like: restlessness a sense of dread feeling constantly “on edge” difficulty concentrating irritability dizziness tiredness a noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations) muscle aches and tension trembling or shaking dry mouth excessive sweating shortness of breath stomach ache feeling sick headache pins and needles difficulty falling or staying asleep (insomnia)your symptoms may cause you to withdraw from social contact to avoid feelings of worry and dread.you may also find going to work difficult and stressful and may take time off sick. these actions can make you worry even more about yourself and increase your lack of self-esteem.if you’re anxious as a result of a specific phobia or because ofpanic disorder, you’ll usually know what the cause is. for example, if you have claustrophobia (a fear of enclosed spaces), you know that being confined in a small space will trigger your anxiety.however, if you have gad, it may not always be clear what you’re feeling anxious about. not knowing what triggers your anxiety can intensify it. you may start to worry that there’ll be no solution.the exact cause of gad is not fully understood. it’s likely that a combination of several factors plays a role, like: overactivity in areas of the brain involved in emotions and behaviour an imbalance of the brain chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline, which are involved in the control and regulation of mood the genes you inherit from your parents – you’re estimated to be 5 times more

       " 'Anxiety disorders in children': 'it’s normal for children to feel worried or anxious from time to time, like when they’re starting school or nursery, or moving to a new area.anxiety is a feeling of unease, like worry or fear. it’s an understandable reaction in children to change or a stressful event.but for some children, anxiety affects their behaviour and thoughts on a daily basis. this can interfere with their school, home and social life. if your child is anxious for a period of time and it’s impacting on day to day life you may need to speak to a healthcare professional to help support your child. for example, if they feel they cannot go to school or see their friends anymore.so how do you know when your child’s anxiety has reached this stage?anxiety can make a child feel scared, panicky, embarrassed or ashamed.some of the signs to look out for in your child are:your child may not be old enough to recognise why they’re feeling this way.the reason for the anxiety (if there is one) will differ depending on the age of the child. separation anxiety is common in younger children. older children and teenagers tend to worry more about school performance, relationships or health.the common types of anxiety in children and teenagers are :young children are commonly afraid of things like the dark or imaginary things like monsters. this is a normal part of growing up, but has the potential to become a phobia (a type of anxiety disorder) when the fear becomes overwhelming and affects your child’s day-to-day life.read about phobiasit’s normal for children to frequently have fears and worries. some anxious children may develop a condition called generalised anxiety disorder when they get older.generalised anxiety disordercauses you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event. it’s a feeling of constant fear or dread all the time that makes doing daily tasks hard because of feelings of anxiety.people affected by it feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed.separation anxiety means a child worrying about not being with their parent or regular carer.it’s common in young children, and normally develops at about 6 months of age. it can make settling into nursery or school or with a child minder very difficult.separation anxiety in older children may be a sign that they’re feeling insecure about something. they could be reacting to changes at home or at school, for example.social anxiety is not wanting to go out in public, see friends or take part in activities.social ‘shyness’ is perfectly normal for some children and teenagers. however it becomes a problem – ‘social anxiety disorder’ – when everyday activities like shopping or speaking on the phone cause intense, overwhelming fear. children affected by it tend to fear doing or saying something they think will be humiliating.social anxiety disorder tends to affect older children who’ve gone through puberty.some children become anxious about going to school. this could also be about schoolwork, friendships or bullying, especially if they’re changing school or moving up a level.they may not always share these worries with you, and instead they may say they have a tummy ache or are feeling sick. one of the signs is crying or seeming tired in the morning.this may be a problem that needs tackling if it is significantly affecting their daily life.post-traumatic stress disorderandobsessive compulsive disorderare other anxiety disorders that can occasionally affect children, but are usually seen in adults.you should seek help for your child’s anxiety if: you feel it’s not getting better or is getting worse, and efforts to tackle it yourself have not worked you think it’s slowing down their development or having a significant effect on their schooling or relationships it happens very frequently or they feel anxious all the time it’s making them feel physically unwell a lot of the time like feeling sick or having constant headaches your child becomes very withdrawn and is anxious about doing things they used to enjoylong-term anxiety can severely interfere with a child’s personal development, family life and schooling.anxiety disorders that start in childhood often persist into the teenage years and early adulthood.teenagers with an anxiety disorder can also: experienceclinical depression feel hopeless misuse drugsif a child is experiencing anxiety, there’s plenty parents and carers can do to help. first, it’s important to listen to your child about their anxiety or worries.you can talk to your gp or someone at your child’s school like the school nurse. you might want to do this on your own or with your child, or your child might be able to have an appointment without you. the healthcare professional should listen to your concerns and offer some advice about what to do next.your child may be referred to the local child and adolescent mental health service (camhs). camhs staff are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems. professionals who work in camhs services include: psychologists psychiatrists nurses occupational therapists physiotherapists and other specially trained professionalsthey should offer help and support to parents and carers as well as the child.more about camhsif your child doesn’t want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help from a local youth counselling service.youth counselling services are specially set up for young people to talk about what’s worrying them, and get advice.for more information,search scotland’s service directoryfor mental health and wellbeing services in your area. counselling may also be available in your local school.telephone helplines or online services can be helpful for children and young people. they might feel it’s easier to talk to someone who doesn’t know them.the type of treatment offered will depend on what is causing your child’s anxiety.it can be helpful for your child to talk in confidence about what’s worrying them to a trained person, especially as it’s someone they don’t know.if your child is being seen at camhs, they might see a child and adolescent psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist. if they’re at a youth counselling service, it might be a trained youth counsellor or psychotherapist.these sessions can help them work out what is making them anxious and how they can work through the situation.psychological therapies can really help with anxiety. they’re evidence based talking treatments, like cognitive behavioural therapy, that are proven to help.cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt)is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave.it’s been proven to help with anxiety and is commonly offered to young people who are anxious.your child will work with the psychological therapist to find ways to change the way they think. they’ll help your child to find strategies for coping in situations that make them anxious. thepsychological therapies matrixdescribes the most helpful talking therapies for anxiety.what is psychological therapy?if your child’s anxiety problem has not got better, your doctor may talk to you about trying medication.a type ofantidepressant, called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri), may help your child feel calmer and differently about things.antidepressants usually take around 2 to 4 weeks to work properly, so you or your child may not notice the difference immediately.it’s natural to be concerned about side effects. your child should be aware of any possible adverse effects and should tell you or their doctor if they happen.some children are simply born more nervous and anxious and less able to cope with stress than other children.sometimes traumatic life events like an illness, or an accident, can cause anxiety. this can happen even if your child was previously confident by nature before.a child’s anxious personality may be partly determined by the genes they’ve inherited from their parents. parents of anxious children may recognise the signs and remember feeling and behaving the same when they were younger.some children can also develop anxiety after a series of difficult life events. they may be able to cope with one of these events, but several difficult events together, or a traumatic single event, may be too much for them to cope with. examples are: frequently moving house and school – it can be hard to settle when you’re always expecting change divorce or separation of parents death of a close relative or friend becoming seriously ill or injured in an accident having someone in the

       " 'Appendicitis': 'appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix. the appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5 to 10cm (2 to 4 inches) long. it’s connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed.nobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn’t harmful.appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe.pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. you may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experiencediarrhoea.read more about thesymptoms of appendicitis.if you’re experiencing abdominal pain that’s gradually getting worse,

continues to get worse and spreads across your abdomen.these are signs your appendix may have burst, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.read more about: diagnosing appendicitis complications of appendicitisin most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible.removal of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the uk and its success rate is excellent.the operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted.open surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult.most people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6 weeks after open surgery.read more abouttreating appendicitis.it’s not exactly clear what the causes of appendicitis are. most cases are thought to occur when something blocks the entrance of the appendix.for example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of faeces or an upper respiratory tract infection could lead to a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel.this obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. the pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting.as the causes aren’t fully understood, there’s no guaranteed way of preventing appendicitis.appendicitis is a common condition. it’s estimated around 1 in every 13 people develop it at some point in their life.appendicitis can develop at any age, but it’s most common in young people aged from 10 to 20 years old.appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.within hours, the pain travels to your lower right-hand side, where the appendix is usually located, and becomes constant and severe.pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse.if you have appendicitis, you may also have other symptoms, including: feeling sick (nausea) being sick loss of appetite diarrhoea a high temperature (fever) and a flushed faceif you’re experiencing abdominal pain that’s gradually getting worse,

gastroenteritis severeirritable bowel syndrome (ibs) constipation bladder orurine infections crohn’s disease pelvic infectionin young women, these symptoms can sometimes have a gynaecological cause, such as anectopic pregnancyor menstrual pain.however, any condition that causes constant stomach pain requires urgent medical attention.you should phone 999 for an ambulance if you get a pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. these are signs your appendix may have burst.if the appendix bursts, it can cause peritonitis, a potentially serious infection of the inner lining of the abdomen.read more about thecomplications of appendicitis.appendicitis can be tricky to diagnose unless you have the typical symptoms, which are only present in about half of all cases.also, some people’s appendixes may be located in a slightly different part of their body, such as: the pelvis behind the large intestine around the small bowel near the right lower part of the liversome people develop pain similar to appendicitis, but it’s caused by something else, such as: gastroenteritis severeirritable bowel syndrome (ibs) constipation a bladder orurine infectionyour gp will ask about your symptoms, examine your abdomen, and see if the pain gets worse when pressure is applied to the appendix area (your lower right-hand side).if your symptoms are typical of appendicitis, this is normally enough for your gp to make a confident diagnosis. in this case, you’ll immediately be referred to hospital for treatment.if your symptoms aren’t typical, further tests may be required in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.further tests may involve: ablood testto look for signs of infection a pregnancy test for women a urine test to rule out other conditions, such as a bladder infection anultrasound scanto see if the appendix is swollen acomputerised tomography (ct) scanit can sometimes take time to get test results. your surgeon may recommend a laparoscopy to inspect your appendix and pelvic organs if the diagnosis is still uncertain.you’ll usually be advised to have your appendix removed if appendicitis is suspected, rather than run the risk of it bursting. this means some people will have their appendix removed even though it’s eventually found to be normal.in some cases where a diagnosis is not certain, a doctor may recommend waiting up to 24 hours to see if your symptoms improve, stay the same, or get worse.if your doctor suspects your appendix has burst, you’ll be sent to hospital immediately for treatment.read more abouttreating appendicitis.if you have appendicitis, your appendix usually needs to be removed as soon as possible. this operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy.surgery is usually also recommended if there’s a chance you have appendicitis but it’s not been possible to make a clear diagnosis.this is because it’s considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting.in humans, the appendix doesn’t perform any important function and having it removed doesn’t cause any long-term problems.appendectomies are carried out undergeneral anaestheticusing either a keyhole or open technique.keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is usually the preferred method of removing the appendix because the recovery tends to be quicker than with open surgery.this operation involves making 3 or 4 small cuts (incisions) in your tummy (abdomen). special instruments are then inserted, including: a tube that gas is pumped through to inflate your abdomen – this allows the surgeon to see your appendix more clearly and gives them more room to work a laparoscope – a small tube containing a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen to a television monitor small surgical tools used to remove the appendixonce the appendix has been removed, the incisions will usually be closed with dissolvable stitches. regular stitches may also be used, which need to be removed at your gp surgery 7 to 10 days later.in some circumstances, keyhole surgery isn’t recommended and open surgery is performed instead. these include: when the appendix has already burst and formed a lump called an appendix mass when the surgeon isn’t very experienced in laparoscopic removal people who have previously had open abdominal surgeryin these cases, the operation involves making a single larger cut in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen to remove the appendix.when there’s widespread peritonitis – infection of the inner lining of the abdomen – it’s sometimes necessary to operate through a long cut along the middle of the abdomen in a procedure called a laparotomy.as with keyhole surgery, the incision is closed using either dissolvable stitches or regular stitches that need to be removed at a later date.after both types of surgery, the removed appendix is routinely sent to a laboratory to check there are no signs of cancer. this is a precautionary measure, although it’s rare for a serious problem to be found.one of the main advantages of keyhole surgery is the recovery time tends to be short and most people can leave hospital a few days after the operation.if the appendix is operated upon promptly, most patients can go home within 24 hours. with open or complicated surgery – for example, if you have peritonitis – it may take up to a week before you’re well enough to go home.for the first few days after the operation you’re likely to experience some pain and bruising. this improves over time, but you can take painkillers if necessary.if you had keyhole surgery, you may experience pain in the tip of your shoulder for about a week. this is caused by the gas that was pumped into the abdomen during the operation.you may also experience some short-termconstipation. you can help reduce this by not taking codeine painkillers, eating plenty of fibre, and staying well hydrated. your gp can prescribe medication if the problem is particularly troublesome.before leaving hospital, you’ll be advised about caring for your wound and what activities you should avoid.in most cases, you can return to normal activities in a couple of weeks, although more strenuous activities may need to be avoided for 4 to 6 weeks after open surgery.while you recover, it’s important to keep an eye out for signs of any problems.contact the hospital unit where the appendectomy was performed or your gp for advice if you notice: increasing pain and swelling you start vomiting repeatedly a high temperature (fever) any discharge coming from the wound the wound is hot to touchthese symptoms could be a sign of infection.appendectomies are one of the most commonly performed operations in the uk, and serious or long-term complications are rare.however, like all types of surgery, there are some risks. these include: antibiotics may be given before, during, or after the operation to minimise the risk of serious infections bleeding under the skin that causes a firm swelling (haematoma) – this usually gets better on its own, but you should see your gp if you’re concerned scarring – both surgical techniques will leave some scarring where the incisions were made a collection of pus (abscess) – in rare cases, an infection caused by the appendix bursting can lead to an abscess after surgery hernia – at the site of the open incision or any of the incisions used in the laparoscopic approachthe use of general anaesthetic also carries some risks, such as the risk of an allergic reaction or inhaling stomach contents, leading topneumonia. however, serious complications like this are very rare.in some cases, appendicitis can lead to the development of a lump on the appendix called an appendix mass.this lump, consisting of appendix and fatty tissue, is an attempt by the body to deal with the problem and heal itself.if an appendix mass is found during an examination, your doctors may decide it’s not necessary to operate immediately.instead, you’ll be given a course of antibiotics and an appointment will be made for an appendectomy a few weeks later, when the mass has settled.another possible alternative to immediate surgery is the use of antibiotics to treat appendicitis.however, studies have looked into whether antibiotics could be an alternative to surgery and as yet there isn’t enough clear evidence to suggest this is the case.if appendicitis isn’t treated, the appendix can burst and cause potentially life-threatening infections.phone 999 for an ambulance if you have abdominal (tummy) pain that suddenly gets much worse and spreads across your abdomen. these are signs your appendix may have burst.if your appendix bursts, it releases bacteria into other parts of the body. this can cause a condition called peritonitis if the infection spreads to the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen.symptoms of peritonitis can include: severe continuous abdominal pain feeling sick or being sick a high temperature (fever) a rapid heartbeat shortness of breathwith rapid breathing swelling of the abdomenif peritonitis isn’t treated immediately, it can cause long-term problems and may even be fatal. treatment for peritonitis usually involvesantibioticsand the surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy).sometimes an abscess forms around a burst appendix. this is a painful collection of pus that occurs as a result of the body’s attempt to fight the infection.it can also occur as a complication of surgery to remove the appendix in about 1 in 500 cases.abscesses can sometimes be treated using antibiotics, but in the vast majority of cases the pus needs to be drained from the abscess.this can be carried out underultrasoundorcomputerised tomography (ct)guidance usinglocal anaestheticand a needle inserted through the skin, followed by the placement of a drain.if an abscess is found during surgery, the area is carefully washed out and a course of antibiotics is given. self-help guide: abdominal pain',\n",

colour from the other, and you have other symptoms, you should treat this as an emergency and call999.arterial thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms within an artery, slowing or stopping the flow of blood.your blood contains cells called platelets and proteins (clotting factors). together they make up the blood-clotting mechanism.when a blood vessel is cut, the platelets and clotting factors in your blood mesh together to form a solid clot at the site of the wound. this clot acts as a plug to stop the wound from bleeding.normally, the blood-clotting mechanism is triggered when a blood vessel is damaged and bleeds, such as when you cut yourself. however, the blood may sometimes begin to clot even when a blood vessel has not been damaged.if this happens, a blood clot can form within a vein or artery (thrombosis).most cases of arterial thrombosis are caused when an artery is damaged by atherosclerosis.fatty deposits build up on the walls of the arteries and cause them to harden and narrow. the risk factors for a blood clot in an artery include: eating a high-fat diet smoking alcohol misuse obesity lack of exercise diabetes (bothtype 1 diabetesandtype 2 diabetes) high blood pressure(hypertension)the tests used to diagnose blood clots in the arteries (arterial thrombosis) will depend on what medical condition the blood clot has triggered.suspected cases of unstable angina and heart attacks are diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ecg).every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals that will show on paper. this allows your doctor to see how well your heart is functioning or if there are any areas not receiving blood as in a heart attack.find out more abouthaving an ecgblood may also be taken to measure levels of a protein called troponin. this is

       " 'Arthritis': 'arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint.in the uk, around 10 million people have arthritis. it affects people of all ages, including children (see below).the two most common types of arthritis are: osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritisosteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the uk, affecting around 8 million people.it most often develops in adults who are in their late 40s or older. it’s also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. however, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. this makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. this can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes.severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.the most commonly affected joints are those in the: hands spine knees hipsin the uk, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. it often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. women are three times more likely to be affected than men.rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body’s immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.the outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. this can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint’s shape. this may cause the bone and cartilage to break down.people with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body. ankylosing spondylitis– a long-term inflammatory condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together. other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints. cervical spondylosis – also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness. fibromyalgia– causes pain in the body’s muscles, ligaments and tendons. lupus– an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body’s tissues. gout– a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. this can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe) but can develop in any joint. it causes intense pain, redness and swelling. psoriatic arthritis – an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people withpsoriasis. enteropathic arthritis – a form of chronic, inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), the two best-known types beingulcerative colitisandcrohn’s disease. about one in five people with crohn’s or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. the most common areas affected by inflammation are the peripheral (limb) joints and the spine. reactive arthritis– this can cause inflammation of the joints, eyes and urethra (the tube that urine passes through). it develops shortly after an infection of the bowel, genital tract or, less frequently, after a throat infection. secondary arthritis – a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards. polymyalgia rheumatica– a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. it can also cause joint inflammation.the symptoms of arthritis you experience will vary depending on the type you have.this is why it’s important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have: joint pain, tenderness and stiffness inflammation in and around the joints restricted movement of the joints warm, red skin over the affected joint weakness and muscle wastingarthritis is often associated with older people, but it can also affect children. in the uk, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis.most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia). jia causes pain and inflammation in one or more joints for at least six weeks.although the exact cause of jia is unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life.the main types of jia are discussed below. arthritis research uk has more information about the different types ofjuvenile idiopathic arthritis.oligo-articular jia is the most common type of jia. it affects fewer than five joints in the body – most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists.oligo-articular jia has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. however, there’s a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular eye tests with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended.polyarticular jia, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. it can develop at any age during childhood.the symptoms of polyarticular jia are similar to thesymptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis. the condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or above.systemic onset jia begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, lethargy (a lack of energy) and enlarged glands. later on, joints can become swollen and inflamed.like polyarticular jia, systemic onset jia can affect children of any age.enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. it can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone.there’s no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition.for osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including: painkillers non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) corticosteroidsin severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended: arthroplasty (joint replacement) arthodesis (joint fusion) osteotomy (where a bone is cut and re-aligned)treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow down the condition’s progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. this is to try and prevent damage to the joints. recommended treatments include: analgesics (painkillers) disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) – a combination of treatments is often recommended physiotherapy regular exerciseread more abouthow rheumatoid arthritis is treated.living with arthritis isn’t easy and carrying out simple, everyday tasks can often be painful and difficult.however, there are many things you can do to make sure you live a healthy lifestyle. a range of services and benefits are also available.many people with arthritis want to continue working for many reasons, including better financial security and higher self-esteem.better treatment options have helped to ensure that many people return to work after being diagnosed with arthritis. this is particularly the case if arthritis is diagnosed and treated at an early stage.you may find work challenging, but your employer should help you with the

       " 'Asbestosis': 'asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos.asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. in the past, it was widely used in construction.asbestos can be very dangerous. it does not present a health risk if it is undisturbed, but if material containing asbestos is chipped, drilled, broken or allowed to deteriorate, it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres.when the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can gradually damage them over time. for asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure to relatively high numbers of the fibres is necessary. however, it is not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure.read more about thecauses of asbestosis.breathing in asbestos fibres may eventually scar the lungs of some people, which can lead to a number of symptoms, including: shortness of breath – this may only occur after physical activity at first, but it can eventually become a more constant problem a persistentcough wheezing fatigue (extreme tiredness) chest pain in more advanced cases, clubbed (swollen) fingertipsnowadays, most people who are diagnosed with asbestosis were exposed many years ago, before there were effective controls on exposure to asbestos fibres in the workplace.see your gp if you have the above symptoms and you think you may have been exposed to asbestos in the past.read more aboutdiagnosing asbestosis.there is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, because it is not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs.one of the most important things someone with the condition can do is tostop smoking, if they smoke. this is because the symptoms are more likely to get worse in people who smoke, and smoking also increases the risk oflung cancerin people with asbestosis.if necessary, treatments such as oxygen therapy can improve the quality of life of someone with asbestosis.read more abouttreating asbestosis.the outlook for asbestosis can vary significantly, depending on the extent of damage to the lungs and whether any other conditions are present.asbestosis can get worse over time and severe cases can place a significant strain on a person’s health and shorten their life expectancy, but in many cases the condition progresses very slowly or not at all.however, people with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as: pleural disease – where the membrane covering the lungs (pleura) becomes thicker, which can further contribute to breathlessness and chest discomfort mesothelioma– a type of cancer that affects the membrane that covers the lungs, heart and gut lung canceroverall, more people with asbestosis die as a result of one of the cancers mentioned above, or from natural causes, than from asbestosis itself.if you have been diagnosed with asbestosis, you may be able to claim compensation. this can be done through: industrial injuries disablement benefit – this is a weekly benefit that may be paid to people with asbestosis who were exposed to asbestos while in employment (but not self-employed) a civil claim for compensation through the courts – you will need to obtain legal advice about how to do this a claim for a lump compensation sum under the pneumoconiosis etc. (workers’ compensation) act 1979 – if you have asbestosis, or you are the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and you haven’t been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer who exposed you (or the person on whose behalf you are claiming) has ceased tradingread more aboutindustrial injuries disablement benefit on the gov.uk website.there are three main types of asbestos that were used in construction. two of these – called crocidolite and amosite – were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans came into force earlier than this) and the use of the third type (chrysotile) was widely banned in 1999.however, despite these strict regulations having been in place for a number of years, large amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings.it’s therefore important to take precautions to reduce your risk of inhaling asbestos fibres if you live or work in a building that may contain asbestos.if you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos, you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council. do not attempt to remove any materials that you think may contain asbestos yourself.if your job means you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure you are fully aware of what you can do to reduce your risk. do not attempt to remove any asbestos you come across, unless you have been trained in how to do this safely.read aboutpreventing asbestosis.asbestosis is a relatively rare condition, because it takes a considerable degree of asbestos exposure to cause it, and regulations to restrict exposure have been in place for many years.however, in 2011 there were 178 deaths directly caused by asbestosis and 429 where the condition was thought to have played a role. 980 new cases were assessed for industrial injuries disablement benefit during 2012.asbestosis is caused by breathing in asbestos fibres. people working in certain trades are more likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the past.asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. materials containing asbestos used to be widely used in construction, because they are strong, durable and fire-resistant.there were three main types of asbestos in commercial use: crocidolite (‘blue asbestos’) amosite (‘brown asbestos’) chrysotile (‘white asbestos’)all these types of asbestos are hazardous if a material containing them becomes damaged and the fibres are released into the air.no crocidolite was imported into the uk after 1970, and both amosite and crocidolite were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans on the industrial use of both these materials came into force earlier than this). chrysotile was not banned until 1999.this means that, although asbestos is no longer used, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.when you inhale a foreign body, such as a dust particle, cells in the lungs called macrophages usually hunt and break the particle down before it gets into your lung tissues and bloodstream.however, asbestos fibres are too difficult for the macrophages to break down. in an attempt to break down the fibres, the macrophages release substances that are intended to destroy the fibres, but actually cause the tiny air sacs in your lungs (alveoli) to become damaged and permanently scarred over time. this scarring is what is known as asbestosis.alveoli are crucial in transferring oxygen from the air into your bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide from your bloodstream. if they become damaged and scarred, these processes will be affected, resulting in symptoms such as breathlessness.for asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure – usually over many years – to relatively high numbers of asbestosis fibres is necessary.the use of asbestos increased significantly after world war ii. it peaked during the 1970s, before declining during the 1980s and 1990s. you may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, where asbestos was used during this time period.occupations particularly associated with exposure to asbestos during this period include: insulation workers boilermakers plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters shipyard workers sheet metal workers plasterers chemical technicians heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanicsnow that asbestos is no longer used, those most at risk of being exposed to asbestos fibres include people whose jobs put them at risk of damaging any asbestos remaining in older buildings, such as caretakers, electricians and demolition workers.thehealth and safety executive (hse) websitehas further information about when you are most likely to be at risk of asbestos exposure.when diagnosing asbestosis, your gp will first ask about your symptoms and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope (a medical instrument used to listen to the heart and lungs).if your lungs have been affected by asbestos, they will usually make a crackling noise when you breathe in.your gp will also ask about your work history, particularly about periods when you may have been exposed to asbestos, how long you may have been exposed, and whether you were issued with any safety equipment, such as a face mask, when you were working.if asbestosis is suspected, you will be referred to a specialist in lung diseases for tests to confirm any lung scarring. these may include: a chestx-ray– to detect abnormalities in the structure of your lungs that could be caused by asbestosis acomputerised tomography (ct) scanof the lungs – which produces more detailed images of the lungs and the membrane covering the lungs and can help identify less obvious abnormalities lung function tests – to assess the impact of damage of the lungs, determine how much air your lungs can hold and assess how well oxygen crosses the membrane of the lungs into your bloodstreambefore confirming a diagnosis of asbestosis, the chest specialist will also consider and rule out other possible causes of lung inflammation and scarring, such asrheumatoid arthritis.there is no cure for asbestosis, as the damage to the lungs is irreversible. however, you can take steps to reduce your symptoms and improve your quality of life.if you have been diagnosed with asbestosis and you smoke, it’s very important to stop as soon as possible.smoking can make your symptoms of breathlessness worse and significantly increase your risk of developinglung cancerat a later stage.speak to your gp for help with giving up smoking. they can advise about nicotine replacement therapies and prescription medicines that can greatly increase your chances of quitting successfully. your gp can also put you in touch with local support groups in your area.you can also phone quit your way scotland on 0800 84 84 84 to get more help and advice about quitting smoking.read more aboutstopping smoking.if you have asbestosis, your lungs will be more vulnerable to infection.it’s recommended that you have the influenza (flu) vaccination to protect againstflu, and the pneumococcal vaccination to protect you from the bacteria that can cause serious conditions, such aspneumonia. your gp can arrange for you to have these vaccinations.you will need the flu vaccine every year to ensure you stay protected. most people only require one dose of the pneumococcal vaccine, although additional booster shots may be recommended if your general health is poor.if you have severe asbestosis, your body may not be getting all the oxygen it needs to function properly.oxygen therapymay be recommended if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood.oxygen therapy is supplied through a machine called an oxygen concentrator, which purifies oxygen from the air in the room and produces a more oxygen-rich supply of air.this oxygen-rich air is breathed in through a mask or a small, soft plastic tube placed just inside your nostrils (nasal cannula).you may be given a small, portable oxygen tank and mask, to be used when you’re out of the house. this is known as ambulatory oxygen.it’s very important not to smoke when you are using an oxygen concentrator. this is because high concentrations of oxygen are highly flammable, and a lit cigarette or flame could cause a fire or an explosion.most people with asbestosis will not benefit from any specific medication for the condition, unless you have another condition also affecting the lungs, such aschronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).more severe cases may benefit from medicines, such as small doses of morphine to reduce breathlessness and acough.serious side effects are uncommon, because the dose is so small. the most common problem isconstipation, and alaxativewill usually be given at the same time to help you pass stools.although asbestos is no longer widely used in the uk, it’s still important to take precautions to reduce your risk of exposure, because it’s still found in many old buildings.strict regulations were introduced in 1970 to regulate the use of asbestos in the workplace.however, the import, supply and use of brown (amosite) and blue (crocidolite) asbestos was not banned in the uk until 1985. white asbestos (chrysotile) was banned in 1999, except for a small number of specialist uses of the material.this means that buildings that were built or refurbished before the year 2000 could still contain asbestos.if you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos, you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council.in these circumstances, it may be best to leave any asbestos-containing materials where they are – especially if they are in good condition and unlikely to get damaged. you should check the condition of the materials from time to time to make sure they haven’t been damaged or started to deteriorate.slightly damaged asbestos-containing materials can sometimes be repaired by sealing or enclosing them. however, this should only be done by someone with the necessary training. any badly-damaged asbestos material that cannot be protected should be removed by someone who is appropriately trained. your local environmental health officer can advise you about this.if you are planning any home improvements, repairs or maintenance, and you intend to bring in any additional workers or contractors, you should inform them of any asbestos materials in your home before they start work. this will help reduce the risks of any asbestos-containing material being disturbed.you can search forwho to contact about asbestos in your homeon the gov.uk website.if your job doesn’t directly put you at risk of asbestos exposure, but you are concerned about asbestos in your workplace, speak to the building duty holder about what they are doing to monitor and manage the situation.a duty holder is someone who is responsible for maintaining and repairing non-domestic premises.if any asbestos-containing materials in your workplace are assessed as being in good condition, and not in a position where they are likely to be damaged, they will usually be left in place and monitored.however, asbestos-containing materials that are in a poor condition or are likely to be damaged during the normal use of the building should be sealed, enclosed or removed as appropriate.if your job means that you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure the appropriate precautions are taken before and during any work you do.the health and safety executive (hse) has drawn up the following checklist for employers, managers and traders to go through before carrying out work on a building that may contain asbestos:steps that may help reduce your exposure to asbestos during your work include wearing protective equipment (such as a suitable face mask), cleaning up as you go (using a vacuum cleaner or wet rags, rather than sweeping) and not using power tools whenever possible.the hse website has more information about: managing and working with asbestos dos and don’ts

       " 'Asthma': 'asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness.the severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems.occasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. this is known as an ‘asthma attack’, although doctors sometimes use the term ‘exacerbation’.severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual.read more about thesymptoms of asthmaanddiagnosing asthmaasthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. if you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal.when you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs – known as a trigger – your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm).common asthma triggers include: house dust mites animal fur pollen cigarette smoke exercise viral infectionsasthma may also be triggered by substances (allergens or chemicals) inhaled while at work. speak to your gp if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday.the reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition.asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and elderly people.read more about thecauses of asthmain the uk, around 5.4 million people are currently receiving treatment for asthma.that’s the equivalent of 1 in every 12 adults and 1 in every 11 children. asthma in adults is more common in women than men.while there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition.treatment is based on two important goals, which are: relieving symptoms preventing future symptoms and attacksfor most people, this will involve the occasional – or, more commonly, daily – use of medications, usually taken using an inhaler. however, identifying and avoiding possible triggers is also important.you should have a personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse that includes information about the medicines you need to take, how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse, and what steps to take when they do so.read more abouttreating asthmaandliving with asthmafor many people, asthma is a long-term condition – particularly if it first develops in adulthood.asthma symptoms are usually controllable and reversible with treatment, although some people with long-lasting asthma may develop permanent narrowing of their airways and more persistent problems.for children diagnosed with asthma, the condition may disappear or improve during the teenage years, although it can return later in life. moderate or severe childhood asthma is more likely to persist or return later on.the symptoms of asthma can range from mild to severe. most people will only experience occasional symptoms, although a few people will have problems most of the time.the main symptoms of asthma are: wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe) shortness of breath a tight chest – which may feel like a band is tightening around it coughingthese symptoms are often worse at night and early in the morning, particularly if the condition is not well controlled. they may also develop or become worse in response to a certain trigger, such as exercise or exposure to an allergen.read our page on thecauses of asthmafor more information about potential triggers.speak to your gp if you think you or your child may have asthma. you should also talk to your doctor or asthma nurse if you have been diagnosed with asthma and you are finding it difficult to control the symptoms.when asthma symptoms get significantly worse, it is known as an asthma attack or ‘acute asthma exacerbation’.asthma attacks often develop slowly, sometimes taking a couple of days or more to become serious, although some people with asthma are prone to sudden, unexpected severe attacks. it is important to recognise attacks early and take appropriate action.during an asthma attack, the symptoms described above may get worse and – if you’re already on treatment – your inhaler medication may not work as well as it normally does.you might be monitoring your asthma using a device called a peak flow meter, and there may be a drop in your peak expiratory flow. read aboutdiagnosing asthmafor more information.signs of a particularly severe asthma attack can include: your reliever inhaler (which is usually blue) is not helping symptoms as much as usual, or at all wheezing, coughing and chest tightness becoming severe and constant being too breathless to eat, speak or sleep breathing faster a rapid heartbeat feeling drowsy, exhausted or dizzy your lips or fingers turning blue (cyanosis)phone 999 to seek immediate help if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe asthma attack.it’s not clear exactly what causes asthma, although it is likely to be a combination of factors.some of these may be genetic. however, a number of environmental factors are thought to play a role in the development of asthma. these include air pollution, chlorine in swimming pools and modern hygiene standards (known as the ‘hygiene hypothesis’).there is currently not enough evidence to be certain whether any of these can cause asthma, although a variety of environmental irritants, such as dust, cold air and smoke, may make it worse.although the cause of asthma is unknown, a number of things that can increase your chances of developing the condition have been identified. these include: a family history of asthma or other related allergic conditions (known as atopic conditions) such as eczema,food allergyorhay fever having another atopic condition havingbronchiolitis(a common childhood lung infection) as a child childhood exposure to tobacco smoke, particularly if your mother also smoked during pregnancy being born prematurely, especially if you needed a ventilator to support your breathing after birth having a low birth weight as a result of restricted growth within the wombsome people may also be at risk of developing asthma through their job.in people with asthma, the small tubes (bronchi) that carry air in and out of the lungs become inflamed and more sensitive than normal.this means that when you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs (a trigger), your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm).asthma symptoms can have a range of triggers, such as: respiratory tract infections – particularly infections affecting the upper airways, such ascoldsand theflu allergens – including pollen, dust mites, animal fur or feathers airborne irritants – including cigarette smoke, chemical fumes and atmospheric pollution medicines – particularly the class of painkillers callednon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), which includesaspirinandibuprofen, andbeta-blockerssometimes given forhigh blood pressureor some types ofheart disease emotions – including stress or laughing foods containing sulphites – naturally occurring substances found in some food and drinks, such as concentrated fruit juice, jam, prawns and many processed or pre-cooked meals weather conditions – including a sudden change in temperature, cold air, windy days, thunderstorms, poor air quality and hot, humid days indoor conditions – including mould or damp, house dust mites and chemicals in carpets and flooring materials exercise food allergies– including allergies to nuts or other food itemsonce you know your asthma triggers, you may be able to help control your condition by trying to avoid them. asthma uk: asthma triggers a-zin some cases, asthma is associated with substances you may be exposed to at work. this is known as “occupational asthma”.some of the most commonly reported causes of occupational asthma include exposure to: isocyanates (chemicals often found in spray paint) flour and grain dust colophony (a substance often found in solder fumes) latex animals wood dustyou may be at an increased risk of developing occupational asthma if you are regularly exposed to substances such as these through your work.occupations that are commonly associated with the condition include paint sprayers, bakers and pastry makers, nurses, chemical workers, animal handlers, welders, food processing workers and timber workers. asthma uk: occupational asthma health and safety executive: asthmaif you have typical asthma symptoms, your gp will often be able to make a diagnosis.they will want to know when the symptoms happen and how often, and if you have noticed anything that might trigger them.your gp may also ask whether you have any allergic (atopic) conditions such aseczemaandhay fever, which often occur alongside asthma.a number of tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. these are described below.in children, asthma can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions can cause similar symptoms in infants. the tests outlined below are also not always suitable for children.your gp therefore may sometimes suggest that your child uses an asthma inhaler as a trial treatment. if this helps improve your child’s symptoms, it is likely they have asthma.a breathing test called spirometry will often be carried out to assess how well your lungs work. this involves taking a deep breath and exhaling as fast as you can through a mouthpiece attached to a machine called a spirometer.the spirometer takes two measurements – the volume of air you can breathe out in the first second of exhalation (the forced expiratory volume in one second, or fev1) and the total amount of air you breathe out (the forced vital capacity or fvc).you may be asked to breathe into the spirometer a few times to get an accurate reading.the readings are then compared with average measurements for people your age, sex and height, which can show if your airways are obstructed.sometimes an initial set of measurements is taken, and you are then given a medicine to open up your airways (a reliever inhaler) to see if this improves your breathing when another reading is taken.this is known as reversibility testing, and it can be useful in distinguishing asthma from other lung conditions, such aschronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).a small hand-held device known as a peak flow meter can be used to measure how fast you can blow air out of your lungs in one breath. this is your peak expiratory flow (pef) and the test is usually called a peak flow test.this test requires a bit of practise to get it right, so your gp or nurse will show you how to do it and may suggest you take the best of two or three readings.you may be given a peak flow meter to take home and a diary to record measurements of your peak flow over a period of weeks. this is because asthma is variable and your lung function may change throughout the day.your diary may also have a space to record your symptoms. this helps to diagnose asthma and, once diagnosed, will help you recognise when your asthma is getting worse and aid decisions about what action to take.to help diagnose asthma that may be related to your work (occupational asthma), your gp may ask you to take measurements of your peak expiratory flow both at work and when you are away from work. your gp may then refer you to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis.some people may also need a number of more specialised tests. the tests may confirm the diagnosis of asthma or help diagnose a different condition. this will help you and your doctor to plan your treatment.this test is sometimes used to diagnose asthma when the diagnosis is not clear from the more simple tests discussed above. it measures how your airways react when they come into contact with a trigger.you will be asked to breathe in a medication that deliberately irritates or constricts your airways slightly if you have asthma, causing a small decrease in your fev1 measured using spirometry and possibly triggering mild asthma symptoms. if you do not have asthma, your airways will not respond to this stimulus.the test often involves inhaling progressively increasing amounts of the medication at intervals, with spirometry measurement of fev1 in between to see if it falls below a certain threshold. in some cases, however, exercise may be used as a trigger.it may also be useful in some cases to carry out tests to check for inflammation in your airways. this can be done in two main ways: a mucus sample – the doctor may take a sample of mucus (phlegm) so it can be tested for signs of inflammation in the airways nitric oxide concentration – as you breathe out, the level of nitric oxide in your breath is measured using a special machine; a high level of nitric oxide can be a sign of airway inflammationskin testing or ablood testcan be used to confirm whether your asthma is associated with specific allergies, such as dust mites, pollen or foods.tests can also be carried out to see if you are allergic or sensitive to certain substances known to cause occupational asthma.read more aboutdiagnosing allergiesreliever inhalers – usually blue – are taken to relieve asthma symptoms quickly.the inhaler usually contains a medicine called a short-acting beta2-agonist, which works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. this allows the airways to open wider, making it easier to breathe again.reliever inhalers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways, so they do not make asthma better in the long term – they are intended only for the relief of symptoms.examples of reliever medicines include salbutamol and terbutaline. they are generally safe medicines with few side effects, unless overused.however, they should rarely, if ever, be necessary if asthma is well controlled, and anyone needing to use them three or more times a week should have their treatment reviewed.everyone with asthma should be given a reliever inhaler, also known simply as a ‘reliever’.read further information: asthma uk: relieverspreventer inhalers – usually brown, red or orange – work over time to reduce the amount of inflammation and sensitivity of the airways, and reduce the chances of asthma attacks occurring.they must be used regularly (typically twice or occasionally once daily) and indefinitely to keep asthma under control.you will need to use the preventer inhaler daily for some time before you gain the full benefit. you may still occasionally need the blue reliever inhaler to relieve your symptoms, but your treatment should be reviewed if you continue to need them often.the preventer inhaler usually contains a medicine called an inhaled corticosteroid. examples of preventer medicines include beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide and mometasone.preventer treatment should be taken regularly if you have anything more than occasional symptoms from your asthma, and certainly if you feel the need to use a reliever inhaler more than twice a week.some inhaled corticosteroids can occasionally cause a mild fungal infection (oral thrush) in the mouth and throat, so make sure you rinse your mouth thoroughly after inhaling a dose. the use of a spacer device also reduces this risk.smoking can reduce the effects of preventer inhalers.read further information: asthma uk: preventer inhalersif your asthma does not respond to initial treatment, the dose of preventer inhaler you take may be increased in agreement with your healthcare team.if this does not control your asthma symptoms, you may be given an inhaler containing a medicine called a long-acting reliever (long-acting bronchodilator/long-acting beta2-agonist, or laba) to take as well.these work in the same way as short-acting relievers. although they take slightly longer to work, their effects can last for up to 12 hours. this means that taking them regularly twice a day provides 24-hour cover.regular use of long-acting relievers can also help reduce the dosage of preventer medication needed to control asthma. examples of long-acting relievers include formoterol and salmeterol, and recently vilanterol, which may last up to 24 hours.however, like short-acting relievers, long-acting relievers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways. if they are taken without a preventer, this may allow the condition to get worse while masking the symptoms, increasing the chance of a sudden and potentially life-threatening severe asthma attack.you should therefore always use a long-acting reliever inhaler in combination with a preventer inhaler, and never by itself.in view of this, most long-acting relievers are prescribed in a ‘combination’ inhaler, which contains both an inhaled steroid (as a preventer) and a long-acting bronchodilator in the one device.examples of combination inhalers include seretide, symbicort, fostair, flutiform and relvar. these are usually (but not always) purple, red and white, or maroon.if regular efficient administration of treatment with a preventer and a long-acting reliever still fails to control asthma symptoms, additional medicines may be tried. two possible alternatives include: leukotriene receptor antagonists – tablets that block part of the chemical reaction involved in the swelling (inflammation) of the airways theophyllines – tablets that help widen the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, and are also relatively weak anti-inflammatory agentsif your asthma is still not under control, you may be prescribed regular steroid tablets. this treatment is usually monitored by a respiratory specialist (an asthma specialist).oral steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory preventers, which are generally used in two ways: to regain control of asthma when it is temporarily upset – for example, by a lapse in regular medication or an unexpected chest infection; in these cases, they are typically given for one or two weeks, then stopped when long-term control of asthma remains a problem, despite maximal dosages of inhaled and other medications – in these cases, oral steroids may be given for prolonged periods, or even indefinitely, while maintaining maximum treatment with inhalers as this maximises the chance of being able to stop the oral steroids again in the futurelong-term use of oral steroids has serious possible side effects, so they are only used once other treatment options have been tried, and after discussing the risks and benefits with your healthcare team.omalizumab, also known as xolair, is the first of a new category of medication that binds to one of the proteins involved in the immune response and reduces its level in the blood. this lowers the chance of an immune reaction happening and causing an asthma attack.it is licensed for use in adults and children over six years of age with asthma.the national institute for heath and care excellence (nice) recommends that omalizumab can be used in people with allergy-related asthma who need continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids.omalizumab is given as an injection every two to four weeks. it should only be prescribed in a specialist centre. if omalizumab does not control asthma symptoms within 16 weeks, the treatment should be stopped.read further information: asthma uk: other treatments and ‘add-on’ therapies asthma uk: steroid tablets nice: omalizumab for severe persistent allergic asthmabronchial thermoplasty is a relatively new procedure that can be used in some cases of severe asthma. it works by destroying some of the muscles surrounding the airways in the lungs, which can reduce their ability to narrow the airways.the procedure is carried out either with sedation or undergeneral anaesthetic. a bronchoscope (a long, flexible tube) containing a probe is inserted into the lungs through the mouth or nose so it touches the airways.the probe then uses controlled heat to damage the muscles around the airways. three treatment sessions are usually needed, with at least three weeks between each session.there is some evidence to show this procedure may reduce asthma attacks and improve the quality of life of someone with severe asthma.however, the long-term risks and benefits are not yet fully understood. there is a small risk it will trigger an asthma attack, which sometimes requires hospital admission.you should discuss this procedure fully with your clinician if the treatment is offered.read further information: nice: bronchial thermoplasty for severe asthmarelievers are a safe and effective medicine, and have few side effects as long as they are not used too much. the main side effects include a mild shaking of the hands (tremors),headachesand muscle cramps. these usually only happen with high doses of reliever inhaler and usually only last for a few minutes.preventers are very safe at usual doses, although they can cause a range of side effects at high doses, especially with long-term use.the main side effect of preventer inhalers is a fungal infection of the mouth or throat(oral candidiasis). you may also develop a hoarse voice andsore throat.using a spacer can help prevent these side effects, as can rinsing your mouth or cleaning your teeth after using your preventer inhaler.your doctor or nurse will discuss with you the need to balance control of your asthma with the risk of side effects, and how to keep side effects to a minimum.long-acting relievers may cause similar side effects to short-acting relievers. you should be monitored at the beginning of your treatment and reviewed regularly. if you find there is no benefit to using the long-acting reliever, it should be stopped.theophylline tablets have been known to cause side effects in some people, including nausea, vomiting, tremors and noticeable heartbeats (palpitations). these can usually be avoided by adjusting the dose according to periodic measurement of the theophylline concentration in the blood.side effects of leukotriene receptor agonists can includetummy (abdominal) painand headaches.oral steroids carry a risk if they are taken for more than three months or if they are taken frequently (more than three or four courses of steroids a year). side effects can include: osteoporosis (fragile bones) high blood pressure (hypertension) diabetes increased appetite, leading to weight gain cataracts and glaucoma (eye disorders) thinning of the skin easy bruising muscle weaknesswith the exception of increased appetite, which is very commonly experienced by people taking oral steroids, most of these unwanted effects are uncommon.however, it is a good idea to keep an eye out for them regularly, especially side effects that are not immediately obvious, such as high blood pressure, thinning of the bones, diabetes and glaucoma.you will need regular appointments to check for these.read further information: asthma uk: side effects of asthma medicinesa personal asthma action plan will help you recognise the initial symptoms of an asthma

see a doctor or asthma nurse within 24 hours.if you are admitted to hospital, you will be given a combination of oxygen, reliever and preventer medicines to bring your asthma under control.your personal asthma action plan will need to be reviewed after an asthma attack, so reasons for the attack can be identified and avoided in future.read further information: asthma uk: what to do in an

help you recognise when your symptoms are getting worse and what steps to take. you should also be given information about what to do if you have an asthma attack.your personal asthma action plan should be reviewed with your gp or asthma nurse at least once a year, or more frequently if your symptoms are severe.as part of your asthma plan, you may be given apeak flow meter. this will give you another way of monitoring your asthma, rather than relying only on symptoms, so you can recognise deterioration earlier and take appropriate steps.read further information: asthma uk: personal asthma

that your gp or pharmacist teaches you how to properly use your inhaler, as this is an important part of good asthma care.if it is possible you have asthma associated with your job (occupational asthma), you will be referred to a respiratory specialist to confirm the diagnosis.if your employer has an occupational health service, they should also be informed, along with your health and safety officer.your employer has a responsibility to protect you from the causes of occupational asthma. it may sometimes be possible to substitute or remove the substance triggering your occupational asthma from your workplace, to redeploy you to another role within the company, or to wear protective breathing equipment.however, you may need to consider changing your job or relocating away from your work environment, ideally within 12 months of your symptoms developing.some people with occupational asthma may be entitled to industrial injuries disablement benefit.read further information: asthma uk:

homoeopathy dietary supplementshowever, there is little evidence that any of these treatments, other than breathing exercises, are effective.there is some evidence that breathing exercises can improve symptoms and reduce the need for reliever medicines in some people. these include breathing exercises taught by a physiotherapist, yoga and the buteyko method (a technique involving slowed, controlled breathing).read further information: asthma uk: complementary therapieswith the right treatment and management, asthma shouldn’t restrict your daily life (including your sleep) in any way. you should

       " 'Atopic eczema': 'atopic eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is the most common form of eczema. it mainly affects children, but can also affect adults.eczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. it is a long-term (chronic) condition in most people, although it can improve over time, especially in children.atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, but the most common areas to be affected are: backs or fronts of the knees outside or inside of the elbows around the neck hands cheeks scalppeople with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).read more about thesymptoms of atopic eczemaanddiagnosing atopic eczema.the exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it’s clear it’s not down to one single thing. it often occurs in people who getallergies– “atopic” means sensitivity to allergens.it can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such asasthmaandhay fever.the symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. sometimesfood allergiescan play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.read more about thecauses of atopic eczema.there is currently no cure for atopic eczema, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.however, severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life and may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally. there is also an increased risk of skin infections.many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including: self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin topical corticosteroids– used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-upsif you have atopic eczema or symptoms of atopic eczema you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. find your local pharmacy on scotland’s service directory.atopic eczema isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your gp practice if required.read more abouttreating atopic eczemaand thecomplications of atopic eczema.about 1 in 5 children in the uk has atopic eczema. in 8 out of 10 cases, the condition develops before a child reaches the age of 5. many children develop it before their first birthday.atopic eczema can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. about half of all cases improve a lot by the time a child reaches 11 years, and around two-thirds improve by the age of 16.however, the condition can continue into adulthood and can sometimes develop for the first time in adults.atopic eczema causes areas of skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red.there will usually be periods where the symptoms improve, followed by periods where they get worse (flare-ups). flare-ups may occur as often as 2 or 3 times a month.atopic eczema can occur all over the body, but is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children. the face is more commonly involved in adults.the severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. people with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. in more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching.scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. it can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. this can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work.areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. this is more noticeable in people with darker skin. it’s not a result of scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a “footprint” of old inflammation and will eventually return to its normal colour.occasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. signs of an infection can include: your eczema getting a lot worse fluid oozing from the skin a yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema the skin becoming swollen and sore a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwellsee your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child’s skin may have become infected.read more about infections and othercomplications of atopic eczema.atopic eczema is likely to be caused by a combination of things.people with atopic eczema often have very dry skin because their skin is unable to retain much moisture.this dryness may make the skin more likely to react to certain triggers, causing it to become red and itchy.you may be born with an increased likelihood of developing atopic eczema because of the genes you inherit from your parents.research has shown children who have 1 or both parents with atopic eczema, or who have other siblings with eczema, are more likely to develop it themselves.atopic eczema is not infectious, so it cannot be passed on through close contact.there are a number of things that may trigger your eczema symptoms. these can vary from person to person.common triggers include: irritants – such as soaps and detergents, including shampoo, washing up liquid and bubble bath environmental factors orallergens– such as cold and dry weather, dampness, and more specific things such as house dust mites, pet fur, pollen and moulds food allergies– such as allergies to cows’ milk, eggs, peanuts, soya or wheat certain materials worn next to the skin – such as wool and synthetic fabrics hormonal changes – women may find their symptoms get worse in the days before their period or during pregnancy skin infectionssome people also report their symptoms get worse when the air is dry or dusty, or when they are stressed, sweaty, or too hot or too cold.if you are diagnosed with atopic eczema, your pharmacist or gp will work with you to try to identify any triggers for your symptoms. read more aboutdiagnosing atopic eczema.your gp will usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions about your symptoms.these questions may include asking: whether the rash is itchy and where it appears when the symptoms first began whether it comes and goes over time whether there is a history of atopic eczema in your family whether you have any other conditions, such asallergiesorasthmayou should tell your pharmacist or gp if your condition is affecting your quality of life – for example, if you have difficulty sleeping because of itching, or your eczema limits your everyday activities.typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following: visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin, such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above generally dry skin in the last 12 months a history of asthma orhay fever– children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions the condition started before the age of 2 (this does not apply to children under the age of 4)your pharmacist should work with you to establish if any triggers make your eczema worse.you may be asked about your diet and lifestyle to see if something obvious may be contributing to your symptoms. for example, you may have noticed some soaps or shampoos make the eczema worse.you may also be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.a food diary involves writing down everything you eat and making a record of any eczema flare-ups you have. your pharmacist can then use the diary to see if there is a pattern between your symptoms and what you eat.allergy testsare not usually needed to identify triggers, although they are sometimes helpful in identifying food allergies that may be triggering symptoms in young children or in those where a food allergy is suspected.read more abouttriggers and causes of atopic eczema.there is no cure for atopic eczema, but treatments can ease the symptoms. many children find their symptoms naturally improve as they get older.the main treatments for atopic eczema are: emollients (moisturisers) – used every day to stop the skin becoming dry topical corticosteroids– creams and ointments used to reduce swelling and redness during flare-upsother treatments include topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus for eczema in sensitive sites not responding to simpler treatment, antihistamines for severe itching, bandages or special body suits to allow the body to heal underneath, or more powerful treatments offered by a dermatologist (skin specialist).the various treatments for atopic eczema are outlined below.as well as the treatments mentioned above, there are things you can do yourself to help ease your symptoms and prevent further problems.eczema is often itchy and it can be very tempting to scratch the affected areas of skin. but scratching usually damages the skin, which can itself cause more eczema to occur.the skin eventually thickens into leathery areas as a result of chronic scratching. deep scratching also causes bleeding and increases the risk of your skin becoming infected or scarred.try to reduce scratching whenever possible. you could try gently rubbing your skin with your fingers instead. if your baby has atopic eczema, anti-scratch mittens may stop them scratching their skin.keep your nails short and clean to minimise damage to the skin from unintentional scratching. keep your skin covered with light clothing to reduce damage from habitual scratching.your pharmacist will work with you to establish what might trigger the eczema flare-ups, although it may get better or worse for no obvious reason.once you know your triggers, you can try to avoid them. for example: if certain fabrics irritate your skin, avoid wearing these and stick to soft, fine-weave clothing or natural materials such as cotton if heat aggravates your eczema, keep the rooms in your home cool, especially the bedroom avoid using soaps or detergents that may affect your skin – use soap substitutes insteadalthough some people with eczema are allergic to house dust mites, trying to rid your home of them isn’t recommended as it can be difficult and there is no clear evidence that it helps.read more aboutpreventing allergies.some foods, such as eggs and cows’ milk, can trigger eczema symptoms. however, you should not make significant changes to your diet without first speaking to your pharmacist or gp.it may not be healthy to cut these foods from your diet, especially in young children who need the calcium, calories and protein from these foods.if your gp suspects you have afood allergy, you may be referred to a dietitian (a specialist in diet and nutrition), who can help work out a way to avoid the food you’re allergic to while ensuring you still get all the nutrition you need.alternatively, you may be referred to a hospital specialist such as an immunologist, dermatologist or paediatrician.if you are breastfeeding a baby with atopic eczema, get medical advice before making any changes to your regular diet.emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. they are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as atopic eczema.in addition to making the skin feel less dry, they may also have a mild anti-inflammatory role, and can help reduce the number of flare-ups you have.several different emollients are available. you may need to try a few to find one that works for you. you may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as: an ointment for very dry skin a cream or lotion for less dry skin an emollient to use instead of soap an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your bodythe difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin.lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. creams are somewhere in between.if you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin.if this is the case, your pharmacist will be able to recommend another product that suits you better. the best emollient is the one you feel happy using every day.use your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms. many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school, or a tub in the bathroom and one in a living area.to apply the emollient: use a large amount don’t rub it in – smooth it into the skin in the same direction the hair grows instead after a bath or shower, gently pat the skin dry and apply the emollient while the skin is still moist to keep the moisture inyou should use an emollient at least twice a day if you can, or more often if you have very dry skin.during a flare-up, apply generous amounts of emollient more frequently, but remember to treat inflamed skin with a topical corticosteroid as emollients used on their own are not enough to control it.don’t put your fingers into an emollient pot – use a spoon or pump dispenser instead, as this reduces the risk of infection. and never share your emollient with other people.if your skin is sore and inflamed, your pharmacist may recommend a topical corticosteroid (applied directly to your skin), which can reduce the inflammation within a few days.topical corticosteroids can be prescribed in different strengths, depending on the severity of your atopic eczema and the areas of skin affected.they can be very mild (such as hydrocortisone), moderate (such as clobetasone butyrate), or even stronger (such as mometasone).if you need to use corticosteroids frequently, see your gp regularly so they can check the treatment is working effectively and you are using the right amount.don’t be afraid to apply the treatment to affected areas to control your eczema. unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. this will give details of how much to apply.most people will only have to apply it once a day as there is no evidence there is any benefit to applying it more often.when using a topical corticosteroid: apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes until the emollient has soaked into your skin, or apply the corticosteroid at a different time of day (such as at night) apply the recommended amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area continue to use it until 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared so the inflammation under the skin surface is treatedoccasionally, your doctor may suggest using a topical corticosteroid less frequently, but over a longer period of time. this is designed to help prevent flare-ups.this is sometimes called “weekend treatment”, where a person who has already gained control of their eczema uses the topical corticosteroid every weekend on the trouble sites to prevent them becoming active again.topical corticosteroids may cause a mild stinging sensation for less than a minute as you apply them.in rare cases, they may also cause: thinning of the skin – especially if the strong steroids are used in the wrong places, such as the face, for too long (for example, several weeks) changes in skin colour – usually, skin lightening after many months of using very strong steroids, but most lightening after eczema is a “footprint” of old inflammation and nothing to do with treatments acne(spots) – especially when used on the face in teenagers increased hair growthmost of these side effects will improve once treatment stops.generally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for many months, using them in sensitive areas such as the face, armpits or groin, or using a large amount will increase your risk of side effects. for this reason, you should be prescribed the weakest effective treatment to control your symptoms.antihistamines are a type of medicine that blocks the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. they can help relieve the itching associated with atopic eczema.they can either be sedating, which cause drowsiness, or non-sedating. if you have severe itching, your pharmacist may suggest trying a non-sedating antihistamine.if itching during a flare-up affects your sleep, your pharmacist may suggest taking a sedating antihistamine. sedating antihistamines can cause drowsiness into the following day, so it may be helpful to let your child’s school know they may not be as alert as normal.in some cases, your gp may prescribe special medicated bandages, clothing or wet wraps to wear over areas of skin affected by eczema.these can either be used over emollients or with topical corticosteroids to prevent scratching, allow the skin underneath to heal, and stop the skin drying out.corticosteroid tabletsare rarely used to treat atopic eczema nowadays, but may occasionally be prescribed for short periods of 5 to 7 days to help bring particularly severe flare-ups under control.longer courses of treatment are generally avoided because of the risk of potentially serious side effects.if your gp thinks your condition may be severe enough to benefit from repeated or prolonged treatment with corticosteroid tablets, they will probably refer you to a specialist.in some cases, your gp may refer you to a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist).you may be referred if your gp is not sure what type of eczema you have, normal treatment is not your eczema, your eczema is affecting your daily life, or it’s not clear what is causing it.a dermatologist may be able to offer the following: a thorough review of your existing treatment – to make sure you are using enough of the right things at the right times topical calcineurin inhibitors – creams and ointments that suppress your immune system, such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus very strong topical corticosteroids bandages or wet wraps phototherapy – ultraviolet (uv) light that reduces inflammation immunosuppressant tablets – to suppress your immune system, such as azathioprine, ciclosporin and methotrexate alitretinoin – medicine to treat severe eczema affecting the hands in adultsa dermatologist may also offer additional support to help you use your treatments correctly, such as demonstrations from nurse specialists, and they may be able to refer you for psychological support if you feel you need it.people with atopic eczema can sometimes develop further physical and psychological problems.as atopic eczema can cause your skin to become cracked and broken, there is a risk of the skin becoming infected with bacteria. the risk is higher if you scratch your eczema or do not use your treatments correctly.signs of a bacterial infection can include: fluid oozing from the skin a yellow crust on the skin surface small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema the skin becoming swollen and sore a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwellyour normal symptoms may also get rapidly worse and your eczema may not respond to your regular treatments.you should see your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child’s skin may have become infected.they will usually prescribe antibiotic tablets, capsules or cream to treat the infection, as well as making sure the skin inflammation that led to the infection is well controlled.speak to your pharmacist or gp if these don’t help or your symptoms get worse.once your infection has cleared, your gp should prescribe new supplies of any creams and ointments you’re using to avoid contamination. old treatments should be disposed of.it’s also possible for eczema to become infected with the herpes simplex virus, which normally causescold sores. this can develop into a serious condition called eczema herpeticum.symptoms of eczema herpeticum include: areas of painful eczema that quickly get worse groups of fluid-filled blisters that break open and leave small, shallow open sores on the skin a high temperature and generally feeling unwell, in some casescontact your doctor immediately if you think you or your child may have eczema herpeticum. if you cannot contact your gp, call nhs 111 or go to your nearest hospital.if you are diagnosed with eczema herpeticum, you will be given an antiviral medication called aciclovir.as well as affecting you physically, atopic eczema may also affect you psychologically.preschool children with atopic eczema may be more likely to have behavioural problems such as hyperactivity than children who do not have the condition. they are also more likely to be more dependent on their parents.schoolchildren may experience teasing or bullying if they have atopic eczema. any kind of bullying can be traumatic and difficult for a child to deal with.your child may become quiet and withdrawn. explain the situation to your child’s teacher and encourage your child to tell you how they are feeling.the national eczema society provides information aboutregional support groups, where you may be able to meet other people living with atopic eczema.sleep-related problems are common among people with eczema.a lack of sleep may affect mood and behaviour. it may also make it more difficult to concentrate at school or work.if your child has problems sleeping because of their eczema, they may fall behind with their schoolwork. it might help to let their teacher know about their condition so it can be taken into consideration.during a severe eczema flare-up, your child may need time off from school. this may also affect their ability to keep up with their studies.atopic eczema can affect the self-confidence of both adults and children. children may find it particularly difficult to deal with their condition, which may lead to them having a poor self-image.if your child is severely lacking in confidence, it may affect their ability to develop social skills. support and encouragement will help boost your child’s self-confidence and give them a more positive attitude about their appearance.speak to your gp if you are concerned your child’s eczema is severely affecting their confidence. they may benefit from

       " 'Atrial fibrillation': 'atrial fibrillation (af) is a condition that causes an irregular heart rate.most commonly, the heart rate will be unusually fast with this condition; but it is possible for the heart rate to be within accepted limits or slower and still be in atrial fibrillation.you can measure your heart rate by feeling the pulse in your wrist or neck. a normal heart rate, when you are resting, should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute. in atrial fibrillation, it may be over 140 beats a minute.atrial fibrillation is defined in various ways, depending on how it affects you: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation – this comes and goes, usually stopping within 48 hours without any treatment. persistent atrial fibrillation – this lasts for longer than seven days, or less when it is treated. longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation – this means you have had continuous atrial fibrillation for a year or longer. permanent atrial fibrillation – this is when atrial fibrillation is present all the time and no more attempts to restore normal heart rhythm will be madewhen the heart beats normally, its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. they then relax, so the heart can fill with blood again. this process is repeated every time the heart beats.atrial fibrillation occurs when abnormal electrical impulses suddenly start firing in the atria (upper chambers of the heart).these impulses override the heart’s natural pacemaker, which can no longer control the rhythm of the heart. the atria contract randomly and sometimes so fast that the heart muscle cannot relax properly between contractions. this reduces the heart’s efficiency and performance and causes a highly irregular pulse rate.atrial fibrillation can lead to a number of problems, including: dizziness feeling faint shortness of breath fast and irregular heartbeat (palpitations) feeling very tiredsome people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms and are completely unaware that their heart rate is irregular.find out more about thesymptoms of atrial fibrillationatrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disturbance and affects up to 800,000 people in the uk.the cause of atrial fibrillation is not fully understood, but it tends to occur in certain groups of people and may be triggered by certain situations, such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or smoking.the condition can affect adults of any age or gender but: is more common the older you get affects about 10% of people over 75 more common in men than womenatrial fibrillation is more likely to occur in people with other conditions, like: high blood pressure diabetes coronary heart diseasefind out more about thecauses of atrial fibrillationandhow it’s diagnosedatrial fibrillation is generally not life threatening, many people live normal healthy lives with this condition, but it can be uncomfortable and often needs treatment.this condition increases your risk by about four to five times of having atransient ischaemic attack (tia)orstroke.this is because when the atria in the heart do not contract properly there is a risk of blood clot formation. clots from the atria may break off and go to other parts of the body. a blood clot passing up to the arteries supplying the brain may cause a stroke.for this reason, treatment may involve medication to control the heart rate or rhythm, and medication to prevent clots from forming in the blood.find outhow to treat atrial fibrillationandpossible complications of having afthe most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation (af) is palpitations caused by a fast and irregular heartbeat.a normal heart rate, when you are resting, should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute. in atrial fibrillation, it may be over 140 beats a minute.if you notice an irregular heartbeat and/or have chest pain, see your doctor immediately.you can check your heart rate by pressing gently on the pulse in your wrist or neck.as well as a fast and irregular heartbeat, you may also experience: tiredness (inability to carry out  normal exercise for you) breathlessness dizziness feeling faint palpitations chest discomfort or painsome people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms and it is only discovered during routine tests or investigations for another condition.the exact cause of atrial fibrillation (af) is unknown, but it becomes more common with age and affects certain groups of people more than others.atrial fibrillation is common in people with other heart conditions, such as: high blood pressure coronary heart disease heart valve disease congenital heart disease (heart defects at birth) heart failure(from any cause)atrial fibrillation is also associated with other medical conditions such as: hyperthyroidism(overactive thyroid gland) heavy alcohol consumption pneumonia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pulmonary embolism (a blockage in a blood vessel in your lungs)not everyone with atrial fibrillation falls into one of the above groups. sometimes the cause can be idiopathic (no known cause) and can affect extremely athletic people.sometimes there is a trigger to an episode of atrial fibrillation, including: drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, particularly binge drinking being overweight taking illegal drugs, particularly amphetamines or cocaine smoking heightened emotional stressfeeling your pulse to check if you have an irregular heartbeat can give a strong indication of whether you have atrial fibrillation (af). however, a complete diagnosis requires a full medical investigation.if you notice your heartbeat is irregular and/or you have chest pain, see your gp straight away.if your gp thinks you have atrial fibrillation after assessing your symptoms, you will be asked to have an electrocardiogram (ecg) and referred to a heart specialist, known as a cardiologist.an ecg is a test that records the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart.small stickers called electrodes are attached to your arms, legs and chest and connected by wires to an ecg machine.every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals. an ecg machine traces these signals on paper.an ecg is usually carried out in a hospital or gp surgery. it takes about five minutes and is painless.if you have the test during an episode of atrial fibrillation, the ecg will record your abnormal heart rate. this will confirm the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and rule out other conditions.however, it may be difficult to capture an episode, as the irregular rhythm may ‘come and go’, therefore, to capture this your gp or cardiologist, may ask you to wear a small, portable ecg recorder for a longer period of time away from the hospital or gp surgery.find out more abouthaving an ecgan echocardiogram, sometimes called an echo, is an ultrasound scan of the heart.it can help identify any other heart problems and assess the structure and function of your heart and valves.find out more abouthaving an echocardiograma chestx-raymay be performed and will identify any lung problems that may have caused the atrial fibrillation.blood testscan also be useful in the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. they may show anaemia, which could be complicating the situation, problems with kidney function orhyperthyroidism(overactive thyroid gland).the treatment of atrial fibrillation (af) varies from person to person and depends on: the type of atrial fibrillation symptoms treatment of any underlying cause age overall healthsome people may be treated by their gp, whereas others may be referred to a cardiologist.the first step is to try to find out the cause of the atrial fibrillation. if a cause is found, treatment for this may be enough.for example, medication to correct hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) may cure atrial fibrillation.if no underlying cause of the atrial fibrillation can be found, the treatment options are: medicines to control atrial fibrillation restoring a normal heart rhythm medicines to reduce the risk of a stroke cardioversion (a controlled electrical shock to reset the heart rhythm) catheter ablation having a pacemaker fittedyou can find out more about each of these below.medicines called anti-arrhythmics can control atrial fibrillation by: restoring a normal heart rhythm controlling the rate at which the heart beatsthe choice of anti-arrhythmic medicine depends on: the type of atrial fibrillation any other medical conditions you have side effects of the medicine chosen how well the atrial fibrillation responds.some people with atrial fibrillation may need more than one anti-arrhythmic medicine to control it.there are a number of drugs that can be used to try to restore a normal heart. the best option for you will be decided by your cardiologist and /or gp.commonly, these drugs include: flecainide beta-blockers amiodaronedronedarone may also be used for certain people.it is important you know what side effects to look out for if taking such medication and seek medical advice if you experience any of them.to find out about side effects, read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for more details.the way the heart beats in atrial fibrillation means that there is a risk of blood clots forming in the heart chambers. if these get into the bloodstream, they can cause a stroke (ourcomplications of atrial fibrillationsection has more information on this).your doctor will assess your risk to minimise your chance of a stroke. they will consider your age and whether you have a history of any of the following: strokeor blood clots heart valve problems heart failure high blood pressure diabetes heart diseaseyou will be classed as having a high, moderate or low risk of a stroke and will be given medication according to your risk.depending on your level of risk, you may be prescribedwarfarin.anticoagulants help to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. newer anticoagulants like apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivoroxaban are now more commonly used than warfarin. they do not require dose changes and continuous blood test monitoring.warfarin may still be used in patients who can’t be treated with a newer anticoagulant, or in those patients with other conditions where treatment with warfarin is preferred.cardioversion may be tried in some people with atrial fibrillation. the heart is given a controlled electric shock to try to restore a normal rhythm.the procedure normally takes place in hospital with heavy sedation or anaesthetic and careful monitoring.in people who have had atrial fibrillation for more than two days, cardioversion is associated with an increased risk of clot formation. if this is the case, warfarin is given for three to four weeks before cardioversion and for at least four weeks afterwards to minimise the chance of having a stroke.if the cardioversion is successful, warfarin may be stopped. however, some people may need to continue with warfarin if there is a high chance of their atrial fibrillation returning and they have a moderate to high risk of a stroke.catheter ablation is a procedure that very carefully interrupts abnormal electrical circuits. it is an option if medication has not been effective or tolerated.catheters (thin, soft wires) are guided through one of your veins into your heart where they record electrical activity.when the source of the abnormality is found, an energy source (such as high-frequency radiowaves that generate heat) is transmitted through one of the catheters to destroy the tissue.this procedure commonly takes two to three hours, so it may be done undergeneral anaesthetic, where you are put to sleep.find out more aboutcatheter ablation for atrial fibrillationon the arrhythmia alliance websitea pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device that is implanted in your chest, just below your collarbone.it will not cure, reverse or actively treat your atrial fibrillation.a pacemaker provides beats where your heart is not supplying its own. if your heart beat is very slow the pacemaker will override this and pace at a set rate. if there are significant pauses between your heart beats beats, the pacemaker will supply a beat, acting as a ‘safety net’.having a pacemaker fittedis usually a minor surgical procedure performed under alocal anaesthetic(where the area is numbed).when the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria, do not pump efficiently then there is a risk of blood clots forming.these blood clots may move into the lower chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, and get pumped into the blood supply to the lungs or the general blood circulation.clots in the general circulation can block arteries in the brain, causing astroke.the risk of a stroke in people with atrial fibrillation (af) is four to five times greater than the general population. however, the risk depends on a number of factors, including age, whether you have high blood pressure, heart failure, diabetes and a previous history of blood clots.if your atrial fibrillation is persistent, it may start to weaken your heart muscle.in extreme cases, it can lead toheart failure, where your heart cannot pump blood around your body as efficiently as before. chest heart & stroke scotland: atrial fibrillation british heart foundation: atrial fibrillation',\n",
       " 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)': \"attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include:symptoms of adhd tend to be noticed at an early age. they may become more noticeable when a child’s circumstances change, like when they start school.the main symptoms of adhd in children and teenagers are:the main signs of inattentiveness are: having a short attention span being easily distracted making careless mistakes appearing forgetful losing things being unable to stick at tedious or time-consuming tasks appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions constantly changing activity or task having difficulty organising tasksthe main signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness are: being unable to sit still, especially in quiet surroundings constantly fidgeting being unable to concentrate on tasks excessive physical movement excessive talking being unable to wait their turn acting without thinking interrupting conversations little or no sense of dangerif you’re an adult with adhd, you may find that: you get easily distracted and find it hard to notice details, particularly with things you find boring it’s hard to listen to other people – you may find yourself finishing their sentences for them or interrupting them it’s hard to follow instructions you find it hard to organise yourself – you start a lot of things without ever finishing them you find it hard to wait you fidget and can’t sit still when there’s nothing much going on you’re forgetful and tend to lose or misplace things you easily get irritable, impatient or frustrated and lose your temper quickly you feel restless or edgy, have difficulty turning your thoughts off you find stress hard to handle you tend to do things on the spur of the moment, without thinking, which gets you into troublesome people with adhd have problems with inattentiveness, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness. this form of adhd is also known as attention deficit disorder (add). add can sometimes go unnoticed because the symptoms may be less obvious.some people might have other conditions alongside adhd.some children may also have signs of other problems or conditions alongside adhd, like: anxiety disorder oppositional defiant disorder (odd) – this involves negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards figures of authority conduct disorder – this often involves antisocial behaviour, like stealing and harming people or animals depression sleep problems autistic spectrum disorder (asd) epilepsy tourette’s syndrome learning difficulties, like dyslexiathe symptoms of adhd can improve with age. although many adults diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems.adhd in adults can occur alongside several related problems or conditions.one of the most common conditions is depression. other conditions that adults may have alongside adhd include: personality disorders bipolar disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd)adhd can also cause problems like difficulties with relationships and social interaction.the exact cause of adhd isn’t fully understood.a combination of the following factors might be responsible:adhd tends to run in families. the genes you you inherit from your parents are a factor in developing the condition. the way adhd is inherited is complex and isn’t thought to be related to a single gene.research has identified some possible differences in the brains of people with adhd.some studies involving brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be a different size in people with adhd.other studies have suggested that people with adhd may have a chemical imbalance in the brain. or that some chemicals may not work properly.certain people are also believed to be more at risk of adhd, including people: who were born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) or with a low birthweight with epilepsy with brain damage – which happened either in the womb or after a severe head injury later in lifespeak to your gp if you think that you or your child may have adhd.if you’re worried about your child, it may help to speak to their teachers before seeing your gp. this means you can find out if they have any concerns about your child’s behaviour.your gp can’t formally diagnose adhd. they can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary.treatment for adhd can help relieve the symptoms.adhd can be treated using medication or therapy. a combination of both is often best. treatment is usually arranged by a specialist, like a paediatrician or psychiatrist.treatment of adhd might include:medication might help you or your child concentrate better, be less impulsive and feel calmer.you might be offered therapy. this might be: psychoeducation behaviour therapy parent training education programmes cognitive behavioural therapy social skills training

       " 'Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)': 'autism spectrum disorder (asd), usually called autism, is something you’re born with. autism means that the way you think about and experience the world is different to most people. this means you can behave differently to most people, and have different strengths and difficulties. for example, some autism characteristics (things you think, feel and do) can make it hard to express yourself in social situations, but you may also be particularly knowledgeable and passionate about topics that interest you.read more about characteristics of autism hereautism is highly variable – the word ‘spectrum’ refers to how autism is experienced differently by different people. autism is considered a spectrum because it’s different for every autistic person – some autistic people might need more support than others to live the lives they want to lead. the way autism affects you can change as you grow and develop, and experience different environments.read more about support heremany people who have been diagnosed with autism prefer using the term ‘autistic’ to describe themselves – this is known as identity-first language (for example, “i’m autistic”). they consider autism to be part of their identity, not a condition to be treated.for a long time people used the term ‘person on the autism spectrum’, known as person-first language (for example, “i’m on the autism spectrum”), and some people still prefer this.in this guide, we’ll mostly use the term ‘autistic’.if in doubt, you can always ask an autistic person what term they’d prefer.in the past, autism was broken down into several different diagnoses, including: asperger’s syndrome autistic disorder kanner’s syndrome childhood autism atypical autism pervasive development disorder not otherwise specified (pdd-nos)because these diagnoses all had the characteristics of autism, they were removed and replaced with autism spectrum disorder (asd), or autism for short. people also use the term ‘autism spectrum condition’ (asc).learn more about autism from autistic peopleat least 1 in 100 people in scotlandare autistic. currently,between 1 in 3 and 1 in 4people diagnosed with autism are assigned female at birth (afab).read more about autism and genderautism is always present from birth, but it might not be recognised or diagnosed until adulthood. early intervention, in the form of support for their individual needs, can be helpful for autistic children.even if you aren’t diagnosed until adulthood, getting a diagnosis can be very helpful for identifying your strengths and the things you struggle with, and finding support.read more about characteristics of autismevery autistic person is different and has different experiences. however, there are some characteristics that are common in autistic people.the way these characteristics show themselves can change with age, and also with the situation you’re in.for example: the way you use language and talk might be different to most people you may use facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures (hand and body movements) differently to most people making and maintaining friendships might be difficult for you you may be good at seeing patterns or solutions, and be good at seeing solutions to problems that other people might not you might have set ways of doing things, and find it difficult to do them differently autistic people are often very good at understanding and working with structured systems, for example languages, music, and computers you may have good attention to detail, and be good at spotting mistakes you might be passionately interested in certain things, and as a result learn a large amount about them in a short time – these interests can change throughout your life you might avoid or seek out certain sensations, like loud noises or specific textures, more than most people, and experience them more strongly there might be some foods you particularly enjoy and eat a lot of, and others that you can’t be around due to their texture or smell when working on projects, you might find it difficult to think about the project as a whole – you may do a great job on your part of a group project, but struggle to imagine how it fits in with everyone else’s part while autistic people can be good at paying attention to detail, you might find it difficult to leave out details that are accurate but not needed when talking to people or working on projects autistic people can be very determined and driven, and keep going with tasks or problems when other people may give up you might find you’re always determined to make sure things are ‘perfect’, and sometimes forget to eat or sleep if you’re working on something it can be difficult for autistic people to work in groups where there isn’t clear communication about what they’re expected to dothere are a number of other possible signs that a healthcare professional will look for when assessing if someone is autistic.read more about diagnosing autism hereat the moment, men and those assigned male at birth are diagnosed with autism more often than women and those assigned female at birth.as more healthcare professionals now know what characteristics to look for, it’s becoming more common for women and those assigned female at birth to receive an autism diagnosis. however, recognising autism can take longer for women and those assigned female at birth. this is because the characteristics healthcare professionals look for are the same for everyone, but women and those assigned female at birth can often show these in slightly different ways. for example, they’re more likely to ‘mask’ autism – hiding autism characteristics and copying what other people without autism do – in order to fit into groups. this can make it harder to recognise that they might be autistic, and to receive a diagnosis.some environments can be very difficult for autistic people, due to the way they experience and interact with the world. every autistic person finds different things difficult, but common examples are: social situations with no timetable or clear ‘rules’ on things like who speaks when – for example, parties and nights out busy environments like concerts, supermarkets, and school playgrounds, where there might be a lot of different loud noises at oncemany environments allow autistic people to feel more comfortable and be themselves. when autistic people are in an environment with people who understand their individual needs and characteristics, they’re likely to: feel more relaxed perform better at tasks find it easier to learn use less time and energy trying to fit in with their environmentbecause every autistic person is different, it can take time to understand how you experience different environments. it may also take time to find the environments that suit your needs, and to learn which ones to avoid.if there’s an autistic person in your life, it’s important to ask them what they’d prefer and if there’s anything you can do to make a new environment more comfortable for them.if you’re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, you can ask how they felt in situations, or look for signs that they’re uncomfortable during or after being in different environments. autistic children are often able to communicate best with those closest to them about what they enjoy and don’t enjoy.read more about finding the right environmentthe signs of autism can be different depending on the person and how old they are.because autism is present from birth, it can usually be diagnosed in childhood. however, it may only be recognised later in life. understanding of autism has grown over time, so more people are now being diagnosed when they’re older if the signs weren’t recognised when they were children.these are signs of autism that health professionals look for when making a diagnosis, but an autistic person may not have all of these signs. for example, delayed speech (learning to speak later than most children), or a child not speaking at all, can be a sign of autism. however, many autistic children talk at the same age a child without autism would.it’s also possible that these signs are there, but they aren’t caused by autism.if you think you or your child might be autistic, talk to your gp or health visitor.the signs of autism can change as children grow – babies and toddlers show different signs of autism than children aged 4 and older.signs of autism in babies and toddlers can include a number of things that affect different parts of their life and behaviour.autistic babies and toddlers might: start talking later than most children seem less aware of others around them – for example, they might not respond to their name being called make repetitive movements when excited or upset – for example flapping their hands, rocking back and forth, or making the same noise repeatedlyautistic babies and toddlers might not: smile back when you smile at them point to show when they want something point to show you something they find interesting share when they’re feeling happy – for example, they might be having fun playing, but they might not turn around and smile at youautistic babies and toddlers might: spend a long time setting up toys in a certain way, and set them up the same way every time enjoy lining toys up in order, or watching parts of them moveautistic babies and toddlers might not: seem interested in playing with other children their age seem to use their toys to make up stories or pretend – they might also start pretend play at a later age than most childrenautistic babies and toddlers might: react strongly to sounds, smells, touch, tastes, or things they can see – for example, if they like the way a stuffed toy feels, they want to spend a lot of time stroking the toy become upset if given something to eat or drink that’s new to them eat a limited range of foodsas children grow and experience different environments, such as nursery and school, the characteristics of autism can appear differently.autistic children might: speak differently to most children – for example, they might use an unusual accent, talk slowly or quickly compared to others, speak in a ‘flat’ tone that doesn’t change, or use a ‘sing-song’ voice use longer or more complicated words than most children, even in relaxed situations struggle to ask other people questions about themselves find it hard to keep a conversation goingautistic children might: show a great deal of enthusiasm for talking about subjects that interest them, but experience significant difficulty when talking about other people’s interests find it difficult to make and keep friends want to play with other children, but find it hard to ask if they can join in have 1 or 2 good friends that they spend a lot of time with spend free time, such as school break times, by themselves find it hard to tell the difference between someone being friendly or joking and someone trying to bully them or hurt their feelings get on better with adults than other children their age get on better with children who are younger or older than them spend time with a group of children, but find it hard to join in with other children’s play, and so spend a lot of time on the edge of the group have friends at school, but show little to no interest in seeing them outside of schoolautistic children might: accidentally make social mistakes, for example correcting a teacher about classroom rules find some social situations, like parties or busy places, overwhelming and difficult to cope with be passive around other children or adults, agreeing to everything and doing everything people ask often tell others what to do, including while playing struggle with social situations with no timetable or clear ‘rules’, such as free play or school break times find it difficult to cope with changes to their routine, especially if the change is unexpected – for example, having a different teacher for a day or having plans change due to bad weatherautistic children might: react strongly to sounds, smells, touch, tastes, or things they can see – for example, being unable to cope with seams in their socks or the noises in supermarkets find certain sounds, smells, feelings or tastes particularly calming or enjoyable – for example, coloured lights or being tucked tightly into bed make repetitive movements when excited or upset – for example flapping their hands, rocking back and forth, or making the same noise repeatedlythe characteristics of autism can affect you differently as you get older – you may also recognise some of the signs of autism in children in yourself as an adult. many people are diagnosed with autism as teenagers or adults based on noticing that they think and behave differently from most other people.as you age and experience different environments, you might notice different signs of autism.as an autistic teenager, you might: find it hard to be understood in conversations, find it hard to work out when to talk in conversations – you might never get to say what you want to say, or find yourself talking over other people find it easier to communicate with other autistic people be able to talk for a long time about the subjects that particularly interest you show a great deal of enthusiasm for talking about subjects that interest you, but experience significant difficulty when trying to talk about other people’s interests be able to answer other people’s questions, but struggle to know what questions to ask or how to answer when someone tells you something about themselves find other people say you use a lot of long words, or use longer or more complicated words than most people often use the same phrases when you’re talking struggle with hidden meanings when other people are talking to you – it might be difficult for you to understand a ‘hint’, or notice when someone is flirting with you find people can take the wrong meaning from your words or behaviour – for example, if you make a lot of eye contact, they might think you’re flirting with themas an autistic teenager, you might: find eye contact uncomfortable, or struggle to know how much eye contact to use do well when you’re in your routine, but find it difficult when routines change – changes might make you feel anxious, make it hard to concentrate, or mean you have to work harder on things it’d normally be easy to do struggle to imagine things that you haven’t experienced before – for example, if you’re going to a party for the first time, it might be hard for you to imagine what will happen and what you’ll be expected to do find yourself making social mistakes without realising why – for example, during conversations you might not realise there are things other people would rather not talk about, or don’t think are important to talk aboutas an autistic teenager, you might: have a lot of knowledge on particular topics, and spend a lot of time learning about them and telling others about them have a hobby you feel very passionate about and spend a lot of time on find it hard to start a new activity but get very focused on it once you get started – you might be able to focus on it better than most people find it difficult to stop doing an activity you’re very focused on, even if you need to move on to something else – you might forget to eat or sleepas an autistic teenager, you might: spend a lot of time being careful to avoid making social mistakes, or trying to make sure you don’t accidentally hurt anyone’s feelings find that other people struggle to understand your feelings from your face or tone of voice find that your friends are often older or younger than you find that your friends tend to be autistic people have to ask people to explain idioms (phrases that say one thing, when they’re actually talking about something else), for example: “we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it”, which means “we’ll talk about that problem later” have a clear idea of right and wrong, and strong views on issues that are important to you – you might struggle to understand exceptions to rules, or ‘grey areas’ find a lot of people don’t understand your sense of humour, and you might not understand why their jokes are funny be trusting, and find people can often take advantage of you find it hard to work out when someone is being unkindas an autistic teenager, you might: have a strong negative reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, being unable to wear certain types of clothing or find it overwhelming being in places with a lot of different noises, like gyms have a strong positive reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, enjoying flashing, multi-coloured lights in nightclubs or how loud the music is at a concert seek out certain sounds, smells, feelings or tastes because you find them particularly calming – for example, coloured lights or soft clothing and blankets find making repetitive movements (often with your hands, fingers or legs) or sounds calming or enjoyableas you age and experience different environments, life events, and circumstances, you might notice different signs of autism. you might also have developed coping strategies for environments you find difficult, changing the way you manage them.as an autistic adult, you might: find it more difficult than most people to communicate in interviews – for example, talking about your skills – which can make it hard to get a job find it more difficult than most people to keep a job – you may be good at your work, but it might be hard to have good relationships with colleagues and managers have a lot of knowledge or feel very passionate about a subject that’s useful for your work or studies find it difficult or frustrating when rules or ways of doing things don’t make sense to you find it more difficult than most people would to work on a project or task that has unclear instructions for how to complete itas an autistic adult, you might: find socialising hard work – when others seem to have a lot of energy after meeting a group of friends, for example, you might feel exhausted have had relationships with friends or partners end because you couldn’t understand how each other thought, behaved, and communicated find dating challenging prefer to be alone during breaks at work find it difficult to make ‘small talk’ – meaning conversation about day-to-day things such as the weather – or understand the reasons for making small talk enjoy spending time with other people, but find activities that don’t have clear ‘rules’ or a schedule – for example, going to parties or nightclubs – difficult because you aren’t sure what to do prefer meeting up with people to do structured activities, like cooking or taking part in a shared hobby or interestas an autistic adult, you might: have a lot of detailed knowledge about a particular topic or hobby and feel very passionate about it find that the hobbies or topics you’re particularly passionate about have changed several times in your lifeas an autistic adult, you might: find other people often misunderstand you, or seem upset by things you say even if you don’t mean to upset them find it hard to understand why people around you see a situation one way, and not the way you understand it find change more difficult than most people do – things that disrupt your daily routine, like changes to your job or going on holiday, can make you feel stressed and anxiousas an autistic adult, you might: have a strong negative reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, being unable to wear certain types of clothing or find it overwhelming being in places with a lot of different noises, like busy buses or trains have a strong positive reaction to sounds, smells, sights, and things you can touch – for example, enjoying lying under a weighted blanket, or the loudness of the music at a concert seek out certain sounds, smells, feelings or tastes because you find them particularly calming – for example, coloured lights or soft clothing and blankets find making repetitive movements (often with your hands, fingers or legs) or sounds calming or enjoyableautistic traits – meaning things that autistic people often do, think, and feel – are often shared by people who don’t have autism too. this doesn’t mean that everyone is ‘a little bit autistic’, or that autistic people don’t need support.to be diagnosed with autism, a person has to have a lot of autistic traits from birth, and those traits need to have a big effect on their life. in order to be diagnosed with autism, those traits must cause what a healthcare professional would call ‘clinically significant difficulties’ in their day-to-day life. this means that they have difficulties with day-to-day life due to their autistic traits and need to use their own ways of overcoming those difficulties, or the people in their life need to help them to overcome them, or both.being in a supportive environment makes a big difference to an autistic person’s wellbeing and quality of life.learn more about how autism is diagnosedpeople who have these conditions can be more likely to also have autism: developmental disorders such asattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd)or learning disability muscular dystrophy down’s syndrome cerebral palsy epilepsy neurofibromatosis – a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves (the main types are neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2) rare genetic conditions, including fragile x syndrome, tuberous sclerosis and rett syndromethe exact cause of autism is unknown, but researchers think it’s at least partly genetic – that autism can run in the family. however, autism can also develop when there’s no family history. there’s no way to predict whether a child will be autistic, even if one or both of their parents are autistic.more research is being done to find out which genes cause autism – it’s thought to be caused by more than one.like everyone else, autistic people can be happy and healthy in the right environment – however, the right environment for an autistic person can be different to the right environment for a non-autistic person.autism doesn’t mean that a person will need additional support to work, have relationships, or enjoy hobbies. however, many autistic people do need additional understanding or support to overcome the challenges caused by having autistic characteristics in a society where most people don’t have them.there’s no cure for autism, and most autistic people wouldn’t want to be ‘cured’ even if it was possible. many autistic people feel autism is part of their identity, and not something to be cured or treated.because of the difficulties they can experience, autistic people may need treatment or support for other conditions, including: low mood anxiety sleep problemspsychological therapieslike cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) are often used to treat depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, both in people who have autism and people who don’t.psychological therapies can help to manage conditions linked with autism, like anxiety, but psychological therapies aren’t a treatment for autism itself. therapy techniques might need to be adapted to work for an autistic person.depending on what’s offered by your nhs board and local organisations, there are therapies to help overcome the challenges that autistic people can experience.possible therapies include: help with communicating, both for autistic people and the people in their lives groups for autistic people to share experiences and advice sensory assessments and support with an occupational therapist to help find ways of managing and improving your environment and how you experience the world training courses for loved ones, to help them understand autism and offer the best possible supportinterventions that aim to ‘train out’ behaviours (like repetitive movements, for example) or force autistic people to behave like non-autistic people are unethical and often harmful. however, many autistic people can benefit from support in learning skills to overcome some of the difficulties they experience – this is different to forcing someone to change their behaviour.for example, an autistic adult might want to learn extra social skills to improve their relationships at work, or a therapist may work with a child and parent to help them to develop their communication skills.these therapies don’t aim to change a person’s autism, but to give them skills they can use. if you’re an autistic adult, the decision to have therapies for things like social skills should be yours. if you have an autistic child, any therapy they have should be with the aim of meeting their needs.learn about avoiding harmful and unhelpful therapies for autismsometimes, when a situation is too much to cope with due to sensory input (things you see, hear, feel, smell or taste), or being asked to do things that cause stress or distress, an autistic person can become overwhelmed.when an autistic person becomes overwhelmed and isn’t able to use or benefit from their coping strategies, they might have ‘meltdowns’ or ‘shutdowns’.it’s important, for parents of autistic children in particular, to be aware that a meltdown isn’t a tantrum. a tantrum is something that a child can control, and tantrums often happen because a child wants something. a meltdown or shutdown isn’t something an autistic person can control, and it’s caused by being overwhelmed.during a meltdown, an autistic person might try to make themselves feel less overwhelmed. this can include doing things like: trying to get away from people – for example by running away or hiding trying to get people away from them – for example by shouting, screaming, hitting, or acting aggressivelyduring a shutdown, an autistic person might try to block everything out – for example by not responding to anything or anyone around them.read more about meltdownslike everyone else, autistic people can display challenging behaviour if they’re in the wrong environment. while it can be challenging for the people around them, this behaviour is often a result of distress or frustration, particularly if an autistic person has difficulty with communicating.behaviour that challenges others is usually a way for someone to get their needs met when they don’t have any other way to do so. it’s not ‘bad’ behaviour, or intended to cause harm. this kind of behaviour is most common in children, or people who find it hard to communicate their needs – for example, people with a learning disability.if you’re autistic, effective communication about your needs, and finding ways to have those needs met, can be helpful in reducing the distress that can lead to behaviour that challenges.if someone in your life is autistic, or you’re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, finding the right strategies for supporting their needs is important and helpful, and can be done if there’s effective support for everyone involved.behaviour that challenges can also be caused by: trying to meet sensory needs – for example, wanting to do something because it feels nice, like rubbing soaps and creams all over themselves and the walls wanting something – for example, being hungry or wanting to play with a toy needing assistance or attention – for example, because they’re bored or want help with a project at school trying to escape an environment or the people around them, but doing so in a way that can be dangerous or harmful, such as running into the roadbehaviour that people can find challenging includes: being destructive – breaking things, for example being disruptive – making noise in class or throwing things, for example self-harm aggressionhelp is available for anyone experiencing distress that might result in behaviour that challenges. finding support can help you identify the reasons behind this behaviour and find other ways of communicating and meeting needs. contactyour gp or the healthcare professional who usually supports you foradvice.environment is important to quality of life for autistic people. there are ways you can adapt (change) and improve your environment to make it as comfortable and supportive as possible for you or your child.the social model of disability is a way of looking at the world that treats the difficulties people with disabilities have as being caused by barriers in society, rather than just the disabilities themselves. these barriers can be physical – for example, buildings not having accessible toilets. barriers can also be caused by people’s attitudes – for example, many people will assume someone is lying because they don’t make eye contact while talking.the social model of disability can be a helpful way of considering the difficulties someone faces, and how to adapt their environment so it works for them.learn more about the social model of disabilityautism is covered by the equality act (2010), which means that schools and employers are required to make “reasonable adjustments” to ensure autistic people are comfortable in their environment and able to learn or work.learn more about the equality act (2010)common changes to an environment that can help autistic people include: sensory changes – for example, being given a quiet space to work, being able to use sensory toys like fidget spinners, or being allowed to make noises while working communication changes – for example, using email or apps to communicate, using very clear language, allowing additional time to ask questions, or using visual communication such as photos or pictures as well as written words routine – keeping to a regular routine and giving warning of any changes as far in advance as possibleevery autistic person is likely to benefit from different changes – the

       " 'Benign prostate enlargement': 'benign prostate enlargement (bpe), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph), is a condition that affects older men and anyone with a prostate.it’s particularly common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age and isn’t usually a serious threat to health.the prostate is a small gland, located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder. it’s involved in the production of semen.the prostate produces a thick, white fluid that’s made into a thinner liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (psa). the liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen.if the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). this can affect how you pass urine and may cause: difficulty starting urination a frequent need to urinate difficulty fully emptying the bladderin some men and anyone with a prostate, the symptoms are mild and don’t require treatment. in others, the symptoms can be very troublesome and have a major impact on a person’s quality of life.read more about thesymptoms of benign prostate enlargementmany people worry that having an enlarged prostate means they have an increased risk of developingprostate cancer. this isn’t the case. the risk of prostate cancer is no greater for people with an enlarged prostate than it is for those without an enlarged prostate.the cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but most experts agree that it’s linked to hormonal changes that occur as a man gets older.read more about thecauses of benign prostate enlargementif your gp suspects that you have an enlarged prostate, you’ll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms.each question has 5 possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score indicates the severity of your symptoms.your gp will also want to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to prostate enlargement.you may have a number of standard tests, such as urine tests, plus some more specific tests, such as a blood test that measures psa.read more aboutdiagnosing benign prostate enlargementtreatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms.if you have mild to moderate symptoms, you won’t receive any immediate medical treatment, but you’ll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate.you’ll probably also be advised to make lifestyle changes, such as limiting your caffeine andalcoholintake, andexercising regularly, to see if they improve your symptoms.as well as lifestyle changes, medication is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. finasteride and dutasteride are medications that are commonly used. they block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (dht) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve associated symptoms.alpha blockers may also be prescribed. they help to relax your bladder muscles, making it easier to pass urine. tamsulosin and alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement.surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication.read more abouttreating benign prostate enlargementbenign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications such as aurinary tract infection (uti)or acute urinary retention. serious complications are rare.read more about thecomplications of benign prostate enlargementbenign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age.the symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are caused by the enlarged prostate placing pressure on the bladder and urethra (which carries urine from the bladder to the penis).this can affect urination in a number of ways. for example, it can: make it difficult for you to start urinating weaken the flow of urine or cause ‘stopping and starting’ cause you to strain to pass urine cause you to need to urinate frequently cause you to wake up frequently during the night to urinate cause a sudden urge to urinate, which can result inurinary incontinenceif you can’t find a toilet quickly enough cause you to not be able to empty your bladder fully cause blood in the urine (haematuria)in the later stages, benign prostate enlargement can cause urine retention and other complications such as bladder stones, bladder infections and kidney damage.see your gp if you notice any problems with, or changes to, your usual pattern of urination. even if the symptoms are mild, they could be caused by a condition that needs to be investigated.any blood in the urine must be investigated by your gp to rule out other more serious conditions.the exact cause of benign prostate enlargement is unknown, but research suggests that hormones probably play an important role in the condition’s development.hormones are powerful chemicals that can have a wide range of effects on the cells of the body.one theory is that as some men and anyone with a prostate gets older, the levels of a type of hormone called dihydrotestosterone (dht) increases, which may stimulate the growth of the prostate.another theory suggests that two hormones, testosterone and oestrogen, play a role. younger men and anyone with a prostate produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. but as they get older, levels of testosterone decrease, which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. it’s been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth.research has shown that rates of benign prostate enlargement are higher among men and anyone with a prostate withhigh blood pressureanddiabetes. however, both diabetes and high blood pressure are associated with the natural ageing process, so there may not be a direct connection between the three conditions.to find out whether your prostate gland is enlarged, you’ll need to have a few tests.some tests will be carried out by your gp and others will be carried out by a urologist (a doctor who specialises in urinary problems).first, your gp will ask about your symptoms. if it seems that you havesymptoms of benign prostate enlargement, the next stage is to calculate your international prostate symptom score (ipss).you’ll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms. each question has 5 possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score is used to assess the severity of your symptoms.the checklist includes the following questions.over the past month, how often: have you had the sensation of not completely emptying your bladder after urinating? have you had to urinate again less than 2 hours after finishing urinating? have you found that you stopped and started again when urinating? have you found it difficult to postpone urination? have you had a weak stream of urine? have you had to push or strain to begin urinating during the course of one night? have you had to get up during the night to urinate?after your gp has assessed the severity your symptoms, they’ll aim to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms using certain tests.the symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are similar to those of other conditions, includingprostate cancer. therefore, your gp will need to be completely sure that your symptoms aren’t caused by cancer.a urine test can be used to check whether your symptoms are caused by an infection in your urinary system, such as akidney infectionor bladder infection.you may need a rectal examination to check whether you might have prostate cancer. prostate cancer can cause the prostate gland to become hard and bumpy.your gp will put on a glove and lubricate one of their fingers, before gently pushing this finger into your bottom and up into your rectum. as the rectum is close to the prostate gland, they’ll be able to check whether the surface of the gland has changed. the procedure will feel a little uncomfortable, but it isn’t usually painful.prostate cancer doesn’t always cause changes to the prostate gland, so you may need to have some more specialised tests to rule it out. you will probably be referred to a urologist for these tests.a blood test can be used to measure the amount of the psa protein that’s produced by the prostate.a raised psa level indicates enlargement of the prostate, and a significantly raised level may indicate prostate cancer. however, as with a rectal examination, a psa test can’t provide a definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer.a trus is a type ofultrasound scanspecifically designed to study the prostate and the surrounding area.an ultrasound probe is placed into your rectum and uses soundwaves to build a detailed image of your prostate.this type of scan measures the size of your prostate and can be used to either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of prostate cancer.a ct urogram is used to study the urinary tract (the bladder and the tubes through which urine passes, also known as the ureter and urethra).a ct urogram can be used to check for blockages in your urinary system that could be causing your symptoms, such as akidney stoneor bladder stone. it can also be used to detect any damage in the urinary tract.during a ct urogram, you’ll be injected with a harmless radioactive dye, which will be visible onx-rays. after 30-60 minutes, the dye should have passed into your urinary tract and a series of x-rays will be taken. in some cases, you may be asked to pass urine before the final x-ray is taken.a voiding chart is a urination diary, which you may be asked to keep for 24 hours. you’ll be asked to record how often you urinate, as well as details about how you urinate – for example, whether your urination is stopping and starting, or whether it’s difficult to start urinating.a voiding chart is a good way of finding out more information about your symptoms and can be used to determine the type of treatment that would be most effective in controlling your symptoms.uroflowmetry measures the pressure of your bladder and how well your bladder works when you urinate.you’ll be given alocal anaestheticand a small flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted into your urethra and moved up into your bladder.water will then be injected through the catheter and into your bladder. a computer connected to the catheter measures the pressure inside your bladder and can assess how well your bladder is working.as with voiding charts, uroflowmetry is a good way of determining what type of treatment will help to control your symptoms.the treatment for an enlarged prostate gland will depend on how severe your symptoms are.the 3 main treatments are: lifestyle changes medication surgeryif your symptoms are mild to moderate, you may not receive any immediate medical treatment, but you’ll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate gland. this is often referred to as ‘watchful waiting’.you may also be advised to make lifestyle changes to see whether they improve your symptoms.if your prostate gland is enlarged, you may be advised to: avoid drinking any liquids for 1 to 2 hours before going to bed – this will reduce your chances of waking up during the night to pass urine (nocturia) experiment with the time you take prescribed medication – for example, taking it at 7pm may help prevent nocturia stop drinkingalcoholand caffeine, or limit your consumption of them – these drinks can irritate your bladder and make your symptoms worse exercise regularly– research shows moderate exercise, such aswalkingfor 30 to 60 minutes a day, can improve symptoms, although it’s unclear exactly why this is the case join a patient support group – your doctor should be able to recommend one, which may help you manage mild symptoms without the need for medicationbladder training is an exercise programme that aims to increase the time between urination and the amount of urine your bladder can hold.you’ll be given a target, such as waiting at least 2 hours between each time you urinate.it’s a good idea to use a bladder training chart, which allows you to record each time you pass urine and the volume of urine passed – you’ll need a plastic jug to measure this. your doctor should give you a chart to take home.you’ll also be taught a number of exercises, such as breathing, relaxation and muscle exercises, to help take your mind off the need to urinate.over time your target time will be increased, and at the end of the programme you should find that you’re able to go for longer without urinating.bladder training should only be carried out under medical supervision.medication, in combination with the lifestyle changes above, is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement.finasteride and dutasteride are widely used to treat benign prostate enlargement.they block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (dht) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve your associated symptoms.find out about thecauses of prostate enlargementif you’re prescribed one of these medications, you may experience an immediate improvement in symptoms.however, you’ll need to take it for at least six months to get the maximum benefit, and your doctor will need to monitor you every year.usecondomsif you’re sexually active – both finasteride and dutasteride can have an adverse effect on your sperm. if you get a woman pregnant, there’s a risk the baby could develop birth defects.other possible side effects can also includeimpotenceand little or no sperm when you ejaculate.in many cases, these side effects will improve as your body gets used to the medication. see your gp if the side effects are troubling you.alpha blockers help relax the muscles of your bladder, making it easier to pass urine. you may be prescribed alpha blockers as your primary treatment or in combination with finasteride.tamsulosin and alfuzosin are 2 alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. side effects of tamsulosin and alfuzosin are uncommon and usually mild.they include: dizziness headaches weakness little or no sperm when you ejaculateyou should only begin taking alpha blockers over a restful weekend when you’re not planning to drive, as there’s a risk they could causelow blood pressure (hypotension)and fainting.generally, if you experience dizziness while taking this medication, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until it’s passed.surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication.various procedures can be used to reduce the pressure on your bladder.transurethral resection of the prostate (turp) involves inserting a small instrument called a resectoscope into your urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis.a wire loop heated by an electric current is used to remove excess tissue from your prostate.turp is carried out using either ageneral anaesthetic, where you’re asleep, or a spinal anaesthetic, where you’re awake, but the lower half of your body is numbed.the procedure can take up to an hour, depending on how much tissue needs to be removed. most people are well enough to leave hospital 2 to 3 days after the operation.after surgery, you’ll be unable to urinate normally at first because of your swollen urethra.a thin tube called a catheter will be inserted into your urethra and up into your bladder to allow urine to drain away. this will usually be removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery.a common complication of turp is you’ll no longer produce semen when you ejaculate. this is known as retrograde ejaculation.it causes sperm to go into your bladder rather than out of your penis during ejaculation. however, you’ll still experience the physical pleasure associated with ejaculation (the climax).bladder neck incision involves widening the urethra so it is easier to pass urine. it is also known as transurethral incision of the prostate (tuip).like turp, the surgeon will insert a resectoscope into your urethra. the resectoscope has a heated wire loop at the end and is used to make small cuts (incisions) in the muscle where the prostate meets the bladder.this type of surgery relaxes the opening to the bladder, helping urine flow out of it. as with turp, tuip is carried out under a spinal or general anaesthetic.after surgery, you may not be able to urinate and a catheter may be needed to empty your bladder. like turp, you’ll only need to use a catheter for a short time until you’re able to urinate normally.there’s less of a risk of retrograde ejaculation with tuip compared with turp, although it can sometimes still occur.holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (holep) is similar to a turp. excess prostate tissue is removed using an instrument inserted through the urethra. however, it uses a laser, rather than a wire loop.there are some advantages to using this technique rather than a turp, but also some disadvantages.if you have been offered a holep, you may want to ask your surgeon to explain why this was chosen for you, and the risks and benefits compared with turp.the insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants is a new surgical procedure that can help relieve urinary symptoms.the procedure can be carried out under local anaesthesia or general anaesthesia.it involves inserting tiny implants through the urethra. the implants are then positioned to hold the enlarged prostate away from the urethra so it isn’t blocked.one of the big advantages of prostatic urethral lift implants compared with turp and tuip is a reduced risk to your sexual function – there is less chance of erectile dysfunction and ejaculation problems.there’s also less tissue injury, which means your recovery will be quicker and you won’t need to stay in hospital as long.however, prostatic urethral lift implants are unlikely to provide permanent symptom relief in all cases. and as it’s a new procedure, the long-term outcomes are unknown and availability may be limited.read more about the use ofprostatic urethral lift implantsto relieve symptoms of prostate enlargement.transurethral vaporisation of the prostate (tuvp) is similar to a turp, but parts of the prostate are destroyed (vaporised) rather than cut away.studies have shown that tuvp is as effective as turp at improving symptoms. but some men and anyone with a prostate may need more treatment in the future.a laser can sometimes be used to destroy the prostate tissue. this particular form of tuvp is called photoselective vaporisation of the prostate (pvp), or greenlight laser surgery.a thin, flexible instrument called a cytoscope is inserted into the urethra. a laser fibre is then passed through the cytoscope to destroy the excess prostate tissue that is blocking the urine flow.the procedure is recommended for those who don’t have a high risk of developing complications from treatment, such as men and anyone with a prostate who: doesn’t have urinary retention doesn’t have an increased risk of bleeding has a prostate smaller than 100mlin these ‘low-risk’ groups, greenlight laser surgery is thought to be as effective as turp, but also has several benefits.these include: a shorter hospital stay – the procedure is often carried out as a day case the catheter can be removed sooner recovery is quicker there’s a lower risk of complicationsthe national institute for health and care excellence (nice) website has more information aboutgreenlight xps for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia.an open prostatectomy is a procedure that may be more effective than turp if you have severe benign prostate enlargement.however, it’s now rarely used, even for larger prostates, because other techniques have been developed, such as holep.during an open prostatectomy, an incision will be made in your tummy and the outer portion of your prostate will be removed.the procedure carries a higher risk of complications, such aserectile dysfunctionandurinary incontinence. there’s also a greater chance that these complications will become permanent than if they occur after turp.benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications, such as a urinary tract infection or acute urinary retention.if you’re unable to empty your bladder properly, there’s a risk that bacteria in your urinary system won’t get flushed out and will spread through the urine to cause aurinary tract infection (uti).symptoms of a uti include: cloudy, bloody or bad–smelling urine pain in your lower abdomen (tummy) nausea vomiting shaking and chills a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or aboveutis can be treated withantibiotics. a single uti isn’t usually serious, but repeated utis can damage your kidneys and bladder. if you have a history of repeated utis, you may need to have surgery.acute urinary retention (aur) is the sudden inability to pass any urine. aur should be treated as a medical emergency, because without prompt treatment urine may be passed back up into the kidneys, which can damage them.symptoms of aur include: the sudden inability to pass urine severe lower abdominal pain swelling of the bladder that you can feel with your handsphone 999 and ask for an ambulance if you or someone you know experiences the symptoms of aur.aur can be treated using a thin tube (catheter) to drain the urine out of your bladder. in very serious cases, surgery may be required to empty the

       " 'Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma)': 'bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is a rare but aggressive type of cancer.the bile duct system, or ‘biliary’ system, is made up of a series of tubes that begin in the liver and end in the small intestine. bile is a fluid the digestive system uses to help break down fats and digest foods.in most cases, there are no signs of bile duct cancer until it reaches the later stages, when symptoms can include: jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine unintentional weight loss abdominal painspeak to your gp if you have signs of jaundice or are worried about other symptoms. while it is unlikely you have bile duct cancer, it is best to get it checked.read more about thesymptoms of bile duct cancerthe exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown. however, some things may increase your chances of developing the condition. the most common include being over 65 years old or having a rare chronic liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc).read more about thecauses of bile duct cancerthere are 2 main types of bile duct cancer, depending on where the cancer begins: cancer that starts in a part of the bile duct inside the liver is known as intrahepatic bile duct cancer cancer that starts in part of the bile duct outside the liver is known as extrahepatic bile duct cancercancer of the bile duct can be difficult to diagnose, so you may need several tests, including: blood tests ultrasound scans computerised tomography (ct) scans magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scansfor some of these tests, you may need to be injected with a special dye that highlights your bile ducts.you may also need abiopsy. this involves removing a small sample of tissue so it can be studied under a microscope. however, in some cases, your surgeon may prefer to remove the suspected tumour based on the results of your scans alone.read more aboutdiagnosing bile duct cancercancer of the bile duct can usually only be cured if cancerous cells haven’t spread. if this is the case, some or all of the bile duct may be removed.only a small proportion of bile duct cancer cases are diagnosed early enough to be suitable for surgery. this is because symptoms usually develop at a late stage.despite this, treatment such aschemotherapycan relieve the symptoms of bile duct cancer and improve the quality of life of people in the advanced stages of the condition.read more abouttreating bile duct cancermost cases of bile duct cancer occur in people over the age of 65. the condition affects men and women almost equally.there are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, but you can reduce your chances of developing it.the most effective ways of achieving this are reducing your alcohol intake, ascirrhosisis a risk factor, and trying to ensure that you don’t become infected with hepatitis b or hepatitis c.read more aboutpreventing bile duct cancerbile duct cancer doesn’t usually cause any symptoms until the flow of bile from the liver is blocked.in most cases, the condition is at an advanced stage by this time.the blockage will cause bile to move back into the blood and body tissue, resulting in symptoms such as: jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine unintentional weight loss abdominal pain – most people feel a dull ache in the upper right-hand side of their abdomen (stomach) high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above and shivering loss of appetitealways visit your gp if you have jaundice. while jaundice is unlikely to be caused by bile duct cancer, it could indicate an underlying problem with the liver, such as hepatitis.the exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown, although some things can increase the risk of developing the condition.cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the dna in cells, which can affect how they grow. this means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.if left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.a number of factors that increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer have been identified.your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct increase as you get older. most people with the condition are over 65 years old.primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) is a rare type of liver disease that causes long-lasting (chronic) inflammation of the liver.it usually occurs in people aged 30 to 50. up to 10% of people withulcerative colitis(inflammation of the colon and rectum) also have psc.around 10 to 20% of people with psc will develop bile duct cancer. your risk of developing bile duct cancer is thought to be higher if you have psc and you smoke.some people can have fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in their bile duct. these cysts are usually congenital, which means they are present from birth.the most common types are choledochal cysts and caroli’s disease, but both conditions are very rare.up to 20% of people with choledochal cysts that are not removed will develop cancer of the bile duct.biliary stones are similar togallstones, except they form inside the liver rather than inside the gallbladder.biliary stones are rare in western europe, but are relatively common in parts of asia, such as japan and taiwan. it’s estimated that approximately 10% of people with biliary stones will develop bile duct cancer.liver flukes are a type of parasitic insect known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer. you can become infected with liver flukes by eating undercooked fish that has been contaminated with fluke eggs.liver fluke infections are usually only a problem in asia (especially thailand) and africa, where liver flukes are more widespread.exposure to certain chemical toxins is known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer.for example, if you are exposed to a chemical called thorotrast, your chances of developing bile duct cancer rises. thorotrast was widely used in radiography until it was banned during the 1960s after its dangerous properties were fully understood.other toxins that may increase your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct include: asbestos – a fire-resistant material that was widely used in construction and manufacturing, but is now banned in this country polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) – a chemical that was used in manufacturing and building but, like asbestos, has now been bannedthe following factors are linked with an increased risk of developing bile duct cancer, but more research is still needed: hepatitis bandhepatitis c cirrhosis(a scarred liver) as a result of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol hiv diabetes obesity smokingbile duct cancer can be a challenging condition to diagnose. you usually need several different tests before an accurate diagnosis can be made.in bile duct cancer, the cancerous cells may release certain chemicals that can be detected usingblood tests. these are known as tumour markers.however, tumour markers can also be caused by other conditions. a positive blood test does not necessarily mean you have bile duct cancer, and a negative blood test does not always mean you don’t.a number of scans can be used to examine your bile ducts in more detail and check for lumps or other abnormalities that could be the result of cancer. these scans include: ultrasound scan– high-frequency sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your body computer tomography (ct) scan– a series of x-rays of your liver are taken and a computer is used to assemble them into a more detailed three-dimensional image magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– this uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a picture of the inside of your liverendoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ercp) allows your bile ducts show up more clearly on anx-rayscanner.a special dye is injected and the x-ray scanner is used to guide an endoscope (a small, flexible tube with a camera at the end) down your throat and into your bile duct. the endoscope can detect blockages in your bile duct that could be the result of bile duct cancer.a short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, may also be inserted into the artery during the procedure. the stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely.an advanced form of ercp is a special test called a spyglass. this involves passing a specialised endoscope into the bile duct to detect abnormalities. it also enables a biopsy to be taken.while this test can help confirm bile duct cancer in uncertain cases, it is very expensive and requires specialist training. therefore, it is only available at a limited number of centres.percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is carried out to obtain a detailed x-ray image of your bile duct.the side of your abdomen (tummy) is numbed usinglocal anaesthetic, and a special dye that shows up on x-rays is injected through your skin and into your liver duct.as with ecrp, a stent may be inserted during the procedure. ptc and ecrp are both useful ways of detecting any blockages in your bile duct that could be caused by bile duct cancer.if scans indicate that you may have bile duct cancer, abiopsymay be carried out to confirm a diagnosis.during a biopsy, a small sample of tissue is taken from the body and checked under a microscope for cancerous cells.a biopsy is usually performed while ercp or ptc is being carried out. as well as taking bile and tissue samples from your bile duct, samples may be taken from nearby lymph nodes. this is to check whether the cancer has spread from your bile duct into your lymphatic system.a widely used method of staging bile duct cancer is a number staging system. the stages are: stage 1a – the cancer is contained inside the bile duct stage 1b – the cancer is beginning to spread beyond the walls of the bile duct, but has not spread into the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes stage 2 – the cancer has spread into nearby tissue, such as the liver, but has not spread into the lymph nodes stage 3 – the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes and major blood vessels that supply the liver stage 4 – the cancer has spread into distant organs, such as the lungsread more aboutstaging bile duct cancer on the cancer research uk websiteif you are diagnosed with cancer, thealan morement memorial fund (ammf)is currently the only dedicated uk charity that provides support for people affected by bile duct cancer.most cases of bile duct cancer cannot be cured. instead, treatment is most commonly used to relieve symptoms.due to the rarity of bile duct cancer, you are likely to be referred to a specialist hepatobiliary unit with experience in treating the condition.a multidisciplinary team (mdt) made up of different specialists will help you decide on your treatment, but the final decision will be yours. your mdt may include: a liver surgeon – a specialist in treating cancers of the liver a medical or clinical oncologist – a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer using techniques such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy a pathologist – a specialist in diseased tissue a radiologist – a specialist in radiological diagnosis and intervention a cancer nurse – who usually acts as the first point of contact between you and the rest of the care team a gastroenterologist – a specialist in the medical management of liver and biliary diseasebefore going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.your recommended treatment plan will be determined by your general health and thestage the cancer has reached.in cases of stage 1 and stage 2 bile duct cancer, a cure may be possible by surgically removing the affected part of the bile duct, and possibly some of the liver or gallbladder.in cases of stage 3 bile duct cancers, the chances of achieving a successful cure will depend on how many lymph nodes have been affected. a cure may be possible if only a few nodes have cancerous cells in them, or it may be possible to slow the spread of the cancer by surgically removing the lymph nodes.in cases of stage 4 bile duct cancer, achieving a successful cure is highly unlikely. however, stenting, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can often be used to help relieve the symptoms.your treatment plan may also be different if you have intrahepatic bile duct cancer, as this is usually treated in a similar way to liver cancer. read more abouttreating liver cancer.a number of experimental treatments may be available as part of a clinical trial.if your mdt thinks it is possible to cure your bile duct cancer, surgery will be needed to remove any cancerous tissue. depending on the extent of the cancer, it may be necessary to remove: the part of your bile duct that contains cancerous cells your gallbladder nearby lymph nodes a large part of your liverafter surgery, it is usually possible to reconstruct what remains of the bile duct so that bile can still flow into the intestine.similarly, it is often possible for the liver to resume normal function after surgery because we do not need all of our liver. the liver can also regenerate itself after surgery.you may need to stay in hospital for up to two weeks or more after having bile duct cancer surgery before you are well enough to go home.success rates of bile duct surgery depend on individual circumstances, such as whether nearby lymph nodes are free of cancer and whether it was possible to remove all of the cancerous cells during surgery.if your bile duct becomes blocked as a result of cancer, treatment to unblock it may be recommended. this will help resolve symptoms such as: jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes itchy skin abdominal (tummy) painunblocking the bile duct is sometimes necessary if the flow of bile back into your liver starts to affect the normal functioning of your liver.the bile duct can be unblocked by using a small tube called a stent. the stent widens the bile duct, which should help to get the bile flowing again.a stent can be inserted using either: a variation of the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) procedure, which uses an endoscope to guide the stent into the bile duct a variation of the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (ptc) procedure, which involves making a small incision (under local anaesthetic) in your abdominal walloccasionally, an implanted stent can become blocked. if this occurs, it will need to be removed and replaced.radiotherapy is not a standard treatment for bile duct cancer, but may help to relieve the symptoms, slow the spread of the cancer and prolong life. the types of radiotherapy are used to treat bile duct cancer: external beam radiotherapy – a machine is used to target radioactive beams at your bile duct internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) – a radioactive wire is placed inside your bile duct next to the tumourradiotherapy works by damaging the cancerous cells. however, it can also damage healthy cells and cause side effects. side effects of radiotherapy include: nausea (feeling sick) vomiting fatigue (severe tiredness)read more aboutradiotherapychemotherapy is used in a similar way to radiotherapy to relieve the symptoms of cancer, slow down the rate it spreads and prolong life. it is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy.medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as cancerous tissue, and adverse side effects are common. side effects of chemotherapy can include: nausea vomiting fatigue hair losshowever, these side effects should stop once the course of treatment has finished. chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.read more aboutchemotherapythe treatments for bile duct cancer are not as effective as treatments for other types of cancer. therefore, a number of clinical trials are being conducted to find better ways of treating the condition.for example, ongoing trials are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medicines, which may help extend the lifespan of someone with bile duct cancer.another promising field of research involves using targeted therapies to treat bile duct cancer. targeted therapies are medications that target the processes that cancerous cells need to grow and reproduce.in studies for some cancers, a medication called sorafenib has proved reasonably effective. sorafenib works by blocking a protein that cancerous cells need to create a blood supply. however, sorafenib is not currently used as a routine treatment for bile duct cancer.as bile duct cancer is a rare condition, there is a possibility you may be invited to take part in a clinical trial looking at the use of these types of experimental treatments.all clinical trials are carried out under strict ethical guidelines based on the principles of patient care. however, there is no guarantee that the treatment you receive during a clinical trial will be more effective, or even as effective, as existing treatments.read more aboutclinical trialsandclinical trials for bile duct cancerthere are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, although it is possible to reduce your chances of developing the condition.the 3 most effective steps to reduce your chances of developing bile duct cancer are: giving up smoking (if you smoke) drinking alcohol in moderation minimising your exposure

events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors.bipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life.bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to develop bipolar disorder.the pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. for example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and are stable in between, while others have many episodes.bipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings. these can range from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression).episodes of mania and depression often last for several weeks or months.during a period of depression, your symptoms may include: feeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time lacking energy difficulty concentrating

but aren’t severe enough to be classed as bipolar disorder, you may be diagnosed with cyclothymia (a mild form of bipolar disorder).bipolar disorder is a condition of extremes. a person with the condition may be unaware they’re in the manic phase.after the episode is over, they may be shocked at their behaviour. however, at the time, they may believe other people are being negative or unhelpful.some people with bipolar disorder have more frequent and severe episodes than others. the extreme nature of the condition means staying in a job may be difficult and relationships may become strained. there’s also an increased risk ofsuicide.during episodes of mania and depression, someone with bipolar disorder may experience strange sensations, such as seeing, hearing or smelling things that aren’t there (hallucinations).they may also believe things that seem irrational to other people (delusions). these types of symptoms are known aspsychosisor a psychotic episode.read more aboutliving with bipolar disorderthe exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. experts believe there are a number of factors that work together to make a person more likely to develop the condition.these are thought to be a complex mix of physical, environmental and social factors.bipolar disorder is widely believed to be the result of chemical imbalances in the brain.the chemicals responsible for controlling the brain’s functions are called neurotransmitters and include noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine.there’s some evidence that if there’s an imbalance in the levels of one or more neurotransmitters, a person may develop somesymptoms of bipolar disorder.for example, there’s evidence that episodes of mania may occur when levels of noradrenaline are too high, and episodes of depression may be the result of noradrenaline levels becoming too low.it’s also thought bipolar disorder is linked to genetics, as the condition seems to run in families. the family members of a person with the condition have an increased risk of developing it themselves.however, no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder. instead, a number of genetic and environmental factors are thought to act as triggers.a stressful circumstance or situation often triggers the symptoms of bipolar disorder. examples of stressful triggers include: the breakdown of a relationship physical, sexual or emotional abuse the death of a close family member or loved onethese types of life-altering events can cause episodes of depression at any time in a person’s life.bipolar disorder may also

medication directly into the bladder, to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.in cases with a higher risk of recurrence, a medication known asbacillus calmette-guérin (bcg)may be injected into the bladder to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.treatment for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or muscle-invasive bladder cancer may involve surgically removing the bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy.when the bladder is removed, you’ll need another way of collecting your urine. possible options include making an opening in the abdomen so urine can be passed into an external bag, or constructing a new bladder out of a section of bowel. this will be done at the same time as a cystectomy.if it’s possible to avoid removing the bladder, or if surgery is not suitable, a course ofradiotherapyandchemotherapymay be recommended. chemotherapy may sometimes be used on its own before surgery or before being combined with radiotherapy.after treatment for all types of bladder cancer, you’ll have regular follow-up tests to check for signs of recurrence.read more abouttreating bladder cancerbladder cancer is more common in older adults, with more than half of all new cases diagnosed in people aged 75 and over.bladder cancer is also more common in men than in women, possibly because in the past, men were more likely to smoke and work in the manufacturing industry.blood in your urine is the most common symptom of bladder cancer.the medical name for this is haematuria and it’s usually painless. you may notice streaks of blood in your urine or the blood may turn your urine brown. the blood isn’t always noticeable and it may come and go.less common symptoms of bladder cancer include: a need to urinate on a more frequent basis sudden urges to urinate a burning sensation when passing urineif bladder cancer reaches an advanced stage and begins to spread, symptoms can include: pelvic pain bone pain unintentional weight loss swelling of the legsif you ever have blood in your urine – even if it comes and goes – you should speak to your gp, so the cause can be investigated.having blood in your urine doesn’t mean you definitely have bladder cancer. there are other, more common, causes including: aurinary tract infection, such ascystitis akidney infection kidney stones urethritis anenlarged prostate gland, in menbladder cancer is caused by changes to the cells of the bladder. it’s often linked with exposure to certain chemicals, but the cause isn’t always known.cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the dna in cells, which can affect how they grow. this means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.several factors have been identified that can significantly increase your risk of developing bladder cancer.smoking is the single biggest risk factor for bladder cancer. this is because tobacco contains cancer-causing (carcinogenic) chemicals.if you smoke for many years, these chemicals pass into your bloodstream and are filtered by the kidneys into your urine. the bladder is repeatedly exposed to these harmful chemicals, as it acts as a store for urine. this can cause changes to the cells of the bladder lining, which may lead to bladder cancer.it’s estimated that just over a third of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking. people who smoke may be up to four times more likely to develop bladder cancer than non-smokers.exposure to certain industrial chemicals is the second biggest risk factor. previous studies have estimated that this may account for around 25% of cases.chemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer include: aniline dyes 2-naphthylamine 4-aminobiphenyl xenylamine benzidine o-toluidineoccupations linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving: dyes textiles rubbers paints plastics leather tanningsome non-manufacturing jobs have also been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer. these include taxi or bus drivers, as a result of their regular exposure to the chemicals present in diesel fumes.the link between bladder cancer and these types of occupations was discovered in the 1950s and 1960s. since then, regulations relating to exposure to cancer-causing chemicals have been made much more rigorous and many of the chemicals listed above have been banned.however, these chemicals are still linked with cases of bladder cancer now, as it can take up to 30 years after initial exposure to the chemicals before the condition starts to develop.other factors that can increase your risk of bladder cancer include: radiotherapyto treat previous cancers near the bladder, such asbowel cancer previous treatment with certainchemotherapymedications, such as cyclophosphamide and cisplatin previous surgery to remove part of the prostate gland, during treatment forbenign prostate enlargement having diabetes – bladder cancer is thought to be linked to certain treatments fortype 2 diabetes having a tube in your bladder (an indwelling catheter) for a long time, because you have nerve damage that has resulted in paralysis long-term or repeatedurinary tract infections (utis) long-termbladder stones having an earlymenopause(before the age of 42) an untreated infection calledschistosomiasis, which is caused by a parasite that lives in fresh water – this is very rare in the ukbladder cancer usually begins in the cells of the bladder lining. in some cases, it may spread into surrounding bladder muscle. if the cancer penetrates this muscle, it can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system.if bladder cancer spreads to other parts of the body, such as other organs, it’s known as metastatic bladder cancer.if you have symptoms of bladder cancer, such as blood in your urine, you should speak to your gp.your gp may ask about your symptoms, family history and whether you’ve been exposed to any possible causes of bladder cancer, such as smoking.in some cases, your gp may request a urine sample, so it can be tested in a laboratory for traces of blood, bacteria or abnormal cells.your gp may also carry out a physical examination of your rectum and vagina, as bladder cancer sometimes causes a noticeable lump that presses against them.if your doctor suspects bladder cancer, you’ll be referred to a hospital for further tests.in 2015, thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of bladder cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. find outwho should be referred for further tests for suspected bladder cancer.some hospitals have specialist clinics for people with blood in their urine (haematuria), while others have specialist urology departments for people with urinary tract problems.if you’re referred to a hospital specialist and they think you might have bladder cancer, you should first be offered acystoscopy.this procedure allows the specialist to examine the inside of your bladder by passing a cystoscope through your urethra (the tube through which you urinate). a cystoscope is a thin tube with a camera and light at the end.before having a cystoscopy, alocal anaestheticgel is applied to your urethra (the tube through which you urinate) so you don’t feel any pain. the gel also helps the cystoscope to pass into the urethra more easily.the procedure usually takes about 5 minutes.you may be offered act scanor anmri scanif the specialist feels they need a more detailed picture of your bladder.an intravenous (iv) urogram may also be used to look at your whole urinary system before or after treatment for bladder cancer.during this procedure, dye is injected into your bloodstream and x-rays are used to study it as it passes through your urinary system.if abnormalities are found in your bladder during a cystoscopy, you should be offered an operation known as turbt. this is so any abnormal areas of tissue can be removed and tested for cancer (a biopsy).turbt is carried out undergeneral anaesthetic.sometimes, a sample of the muscle wall of your bladder is also taken to check whether the cancer has spread, but this may be a separate operation within 6 weeks of the firstbiopsy.you should also be offered a dose ofchemotherapyafter the operation. this may help to prevent the bladder cancer returning if the removed cells are found to be cancerous.seetreating bladder cancerfor more information about the turbt procedureonce these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you the grade of the cancer and what stage it is.staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. lower-stage cancers are smaller and have a better chance of successful treatment.grading is a measurement of how likely a cancer is to spread. the grade of a cancer is usually described using a number system ranging from g1 to g3. high-grade cancers are more likely to spread than low-grade cancers.the most widely used staging system for bladder cancer is known as the tnm system, where: t stands for how far into the bladder the tumour has grown n stands for whether the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes m stands for whether the cancer has spread into another part of the body (metastasis), such as the lungsthe t staging system is as follows: tis or cis (carcinoma in situ) – a very early high-grade cancer confined to the innermost layer of the bladder lining ta – the cancer is just in the innermost layer of the bladder lining t1 – the cancerous cells have started to grow into the connective tissue beyond the bladder liningbladder cancer up to the t1 stage is usually called early bladder cancer or non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.if the tumour grows larger than this, it’s usually called muscle-invasive bladder cancer and is categorised as: t2 – the cancer has grown through the connective tissue, into the bladder muscle t3 – the cancer has grown through the layer of muscles, into the surrounding layer of fatif the tumour grows larger than the t3 stage, it’s considered to be advanced bladder cancer and is categorised as: t4 – the cancer has spread outside the bladder, into surrounding organsthe n staging system is as follows: n0 – there are no cancerous cells in any of your lymph nodes n1 – there are cancerous cells in just one of your lymph nodes in your pelvis n2 – there are cancerous cells in two or more lymph nodes in your pelvis n3 – there are cancerous cells in one or more of your lymph nodes (known as common iliac nodes) deep in your grointhere are only two options in the m system: m0 – where the cancer hasn’t spread to another part of the body m1 – where the cancer has spread to another part of the body, such as the bones, lungs or liverthe tnm system can be difficult to understand, so don’t be afraid to ask your care team questions about your test results and what they mean for your treatment and outlook.the treatment options for bladder cancer largely depend on how advanced the cancer is.treatments usually differ between early stage, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and more advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer.all hospitals use mdts to treat bladder cancer. these are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.members of your mdt may include: a urologist – a surgeon specialising in treating conditions affecting the urinary tract a clinical oncologist – a specialist in chemotherapy and radiotherapy a pathologist – a specialist in diseased tissue a radiologist – a specialist in detecting disease using imaging techniquesyou should be given the contact details for a clinical nurse specialist, who will be in contact with all members of your mdt. they’ll be able to answer questions and support you throughout your treatment.deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. your mdt will make recommendations, but remember that the final decision is yours.before discussing your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask your mdt.if you’ve been diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stages cis, ta and t1), your recommended treatment plan depends on the risk of the cancer returning or spreading beyond the lining of your bladder.this risk is calculated using a series of factors, including: the number of tumours present in your bladder whether the tumours are larger than 3cm (1 inch) in diameter whether you’ve had bladder cancer before the grade of the cancer cellsthese treatments are discussed in more detail below.low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is treated with transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (turbt). this procedure may be performed during your first cystoscopy when tissue samples are taken for testing (seediagnosing bladder cancer).turbt is carried out undergeneral anaesthetic. the surgeon uses an instrument called a cystoscope to locate the visible tumours and cut them away from the lining of the bladder. the wounds are sealed (cauterised) using a mild electric current, and you may be given acatheterto drain any blood or debris from your bladder over the next few days.after surgery, you may be given a single dose ofchemotherapy, directly into your bladder, using a catheter. the solution is kept in your bladder for around an hour before being drained away.most people are able to leave hospital less than 48 hours after having turbt and are able to resume normal physical activity within 2 weeks.you should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months and nine months to check your bladder, using acystoscopy. if your cancer returns after 6 months and is small, you may be offered a treatment called fulguration. this involves using an electric current to destroy the cancer cells.people with intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a course of at least 6 doses of chemotherapy. the liquid is placed directly into your bladder, using a catheter, and kept there for around an hour before being drained away.you should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months, 9 months, 18 months, then once every year. at these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy. if your cancer returns within 5 years, you’ll be referred back to a specialist urology team.some residue of the chemotherapy medication may be left in your urine after treatment, which could severely irritate your skin. it helps if you urinate while sitting down and that you’re careful not to splash yourself or the toilet seat. after passing urine, wash the skin around your genitals with soap and water.if you’re sexually active, it’s important to use a barrier method ofcontraception, such as a condom. this is because the medication may be present in your semen or vaginal fluids, which can cause irritation.you also shouldn’t try to get pregnant or father a child while having chemotherapy for bladder cancer, as the medication can increase the risk of having a child with birth defects.people with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a second turbt operation, within 6 weeks of the initial investigation (seediagnosing bladder cancer). act scanor anmri scanmay also be required.your urologist and clinical nurse specialist will discuss your treatment options with you, which will either be: a course of bacillus calmette-guérin (bcg) treatment – using a variant of thebcg vaccine an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy)the bcg vaccine is passed into your bladder through a catheter and left for 2 hours before being drained away. most people require weekly treatments over a 6-week period. common side effects of bcg include: a frequent need to urinate pain when urinating blood in your urine (haematuria) flu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, fever and aching urinary tract infectionsif bcg treatment doesn’t work, or the side effects are too strong, you’ll be referred back to a specialist urology team.you should be offered follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, then once a year. at these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.if you decide to have a cystectomy, your surgeon will need to create an alternative way for urine to leave your body (urinary diversion). your clinical nurse specialist can discuss your options for the procedure and how the urinary diversion will be created.read about thecomplications of bladder cancer surgeryfor more information about urinary diversion and sexual problems after surgery.after having a cystectomy, you should be offered follow-up appointments including a ct scan at six and 12 months, and blood tests once a year. men require an appointment to check their urethra once a year for 5 years.the recommended treatment plan for muscle-invasive bladder cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. with t2 and t3 bladder cancer, treatment aims to cure the condition if possible, or at least control it for a long time.your urologist, oncologist and clinical nurse specialist will discuss your treatment options with you, which will either be: an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy) – see above radiotherapywith a radiosensitiseryour oncologist should also discuss the possibility of having chemotherapy before either of these treatments (neoadjuvant therapy), if it’s suitable for you.radiotherapy is given by a machine that beams the radiation at the bladder (external radiotherapy). sessions are usually given on a daily basis for 5 days a week over the course of 4 to 7 weeks. each session lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes.a radiosensitiser should also be given alongside radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. this is a medicine which affects the cells of a tumour, to enhance the effect of radiotherapy. it has a much smaller effect on normal tissue.as well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells, which means it can cause a number of side effects. these include: diarrhoea inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) tightening of the vagina (in women), which can make having sex painful erectile dysfunction (in men) loss of pubic hair infertility tiredness difficulty passing urinemost of these side effects should pass a few weeks after your treatment finishes, although there’s a chance they’ll be permanent.having radiation directed at your pelvis usually means you’ll be infertile for the rest of your life. however, most people treated for bladder cancer are too old to have children, so this isn’t usually a problem.after having radiotherapy for bladder cancer, you should be offered follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and every year after that. at these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.you may also be offered ct scans of your abdomen, pelvis and chest after 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. a ct scan of your urinary tract may be offered every year for 5 years.your mdt may recommend a specific treatment because of your individual circumstances.for example, someone with a small bladder or many existing urinary symptoms is better suited to surgery. someone who has a single bladder tumour with normal bladder function is better suited for treatments that preserve the bladder.however, your input is also important, so you should discuss which treatment is best for you with your mdt.there are pros and cons of both surgery and radiotherapy.the pros of having a radical cystectomy include: treatment is carried out in one go you won’t need regular cystoscopies after treatment, although other less invasive tests may be neededthe cons of having a radical cystectomy include: it can take up to 3 months to fully recover a risk of general surgical complications, such as pain, infection and bleeding a risk of complications from the use of general anaesthetic an alternative way of passing urine out of your body needs to be created, which may involve an external bag a high risk of erectile dysfunction in men (estimated at around 90%) as a result of nerve damage after surgery, some women may find sex uncomfortable, as their vagina may be smaller a small chance of a fatal complication, such as aheart attack,strokeordeep vein thrombosis (dvt)the pros of having radiotherapy include: there’s no need to have surgery, which is often an important consideration for people in poor health your bladder function may not be affected, as your bladder isn’t removed there’s less chance of causing erectile dysfunction (around 30%)the cons of having radiotherapy include: you’ll require regular sessions of radiotherapy for 4 to 7 weeks short-term side effects are common, such as diarrhoea, tiredness and inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) a small chance of permanently damaging the bladder, which could lead to problems urinating women may experience a narrowed vagina, making sex difficult and uncomfortablein some cases, chemotherapy may be used during treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. instead of medication being put directly into your bladder, it’s put into a vein in your arm. this is called intravenous chemotherapy and can be used: before radiotherapy and surgery to shrink the size of any tumours in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation) to slow the spread of incurable advanced bladder cancer (palliative chemotherapy)there isn’t enough evidence to say whether chemotherapy is an effective treatment when it’s given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning. it’s usually only used this way as part of aclinical trial. seeclinical trials for bladder cancerfor more information.chemotherapy is usually given over a few consecutive days at first. you’ll then have a few weeks off to allow your body to recover before the treatment begins again. this cycle will be repeated for a few months.as the chemotherapy medication is being injected into your blood, you’ll experience a wider range of side effects than if you were having chemotherapy directly into the bladder. these side effects should stop after the treatment has finished.chemotherapy weakens your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. it’s important to report any symptoms of a potential infection, such as a high temperature, persistent cough or reddening of the skin, to your mdt. avoid close contact with people who are known to have an infection.other side effects of chemotherapy can include: nausea vomiting hair loss lack of appetite tirednessthe recommended treatment plan for locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. your oncologist should discuss your treatment options with you, which may include: a course of chemotherapy treatments to relieve cancer symptomsif you receive a course of chemotherapy, you’ll be given a combination of drugs to help relieve the side effects of treatment. treatment may be stopped if chemotherapy isn’t helping, or a second course may be offered.you may be offered treatment to relieve any cancer symptoms. this may include: radiotherapy to treat painful urination, blood in urine, frequently needing to urinate or pain in your pelvic area treatment to drain your kidneys, if they become blocked and cause lower back painif your cancer is at an advanced stage and can’t be cured, your mdt should discuss how the cancer will progress and which treatments are available to ease the symptoms.you can be referred to a palliative care team, who can provide support and practical help, including pain relief.read more aboutend of life carea diagnosis of bladder cancer, and some treatments for the condition, can have a significant impact on your life.the emotional impact of living with bladder cancer can be huge. many people report experiencing a kind of ‘rollercoaster’ effect. for example, you may feel down at receiving a diagnosis, up when the cancer is removed, and down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of your treatment.this type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger feelings ofdepression. signs that you may be depressed include: having continuous feelings of sadness or hopelessness no longer taking pleasure in the things you enjoycontact your gp for advice if you think you may be depressed. there’s a range of relatively successful treatments for depression, includingantidepressant medicationand therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt).read more aboutcoping with cancerif your bladder is removed, an alternative way of passing urine out of your body will be created during the operation. this is called urinary diversion.there are various types of urinary diversion, which are described below. in some cases, you may be able to make a choice based on your personal preferences. however, certain treatment options will not be suitable for everyone.your multidisciplinary team (mdt) can provide information on the most suitable options for you.a urostomy is carried out during a radical cystectomy. a small section of the small bowel is removed and connected to your ureters (the 2 tubes that normally carry urine out of the kidneys).the surgeon then creates a small hole in the surface of your abdomen and the open end of the removed bowel is placed in this hole, creating an opening known as a stoma.a special waterproof bag is placed over the stoma to collect urine. a stoma nurse will teach you how to care for your stoma, and how and when to change the bag.continent urinary diversion is similar to a urostomy, but without an external bag. instead, a section of your bowel is used to create a pouch inside your body that stores urine.the ureters are connected to the pouch and the pouch is connected to an opening in the abdominal wall. a valve in the opening (stoma) prevents urine leaking out.the pouch is emptied using a thin, flexible tube (catheter). most people need to empty their pouch about 4 or 5 times a day.in some cases it may be possible to create a new bladder, known as a neobladder. this involves removing a section of your bowel and reconstructing it into a balloon-like sac, before connecting it to your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) at one end and your ureters at the other end. however, bladder reconstruction isn’t suitable for everyone.you’ll be taught how to empty your neobladder by relaxing the muscles in your pelvis, while tightening the muscles in your abdomen at the same time.your neobladder won’t contain the same types of nerve endings as a real bladder, so you won’t get the distinctive sensation that tells you to pass urine. some people experience a feeling of fullness inside their abdomen, while others have reported they feel like they need to pass wind.because of the loss of normal nerve function, most people with a neobladder experience some episodes ofurinary incontinence, which usually occurs during the night, while they’re asleep.you may find it useful to empty your neobladder at set times during the day, including before you go to bed, to help prevent incontinence.contact your mdt if you lose the ability to obtain or maintain an erection after a radical cystectomy. it may be possible for you to be treated with a type of medicine known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (pde5). pde5s work by increasing the blood supply to your penis.pde5s are sometimes combined with a device called a vacuum pump, which consists of a cylinder connected to a pump. the penis is placed inside the cylinder and the air is pumped out. this creates a vacuum that causes blood to flow into the penis. a rubber ring is then placed around the base of the penis, which allows an erection to be maintained for around 30 minutes.read more abouttreating erectile dysfunctionboth radiotherapy and cystectomy can cause a woman’s vagina to become shortened and narrowed, which can make penetrative sex painful or difficult.there are 2 main treatment options available if you have a narrowed vagina. the first is to apply hormonal cream to the area, which should help to increase moisture inside your vagina.the second is to use vaginal dilators. these are plastic cone-shaped devices of various sizes that are designed to gently stretch your vagina and make it more supple.it’s usually recommended that you use dilators for a 5 to 10-minute period every day, starting with the dilator that fits in easiest first and gradually increasing the size, as your vagina stretches over the following weeks.many women find this an embarrassing issue to discuss, but the use of dilators is a well-recognised treatment for narrowing of the vagina. your specialist cancer nurse should be able to provide more information and advice.you may find that the more often you have penetrative sex, the less painful it becomes. however, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner.the macmillan cancer support website has information and a video aboutcancer and sexualityit’s not always possible to prevent bladder cancer, but some risk factors have been identified, which may increase your risk of developing the condition.if you smoke, giving up is the best way to reduce your risk of developing bladder cancer and preventing it from recurring.if you decide to stop smoking, you could contact the quit your way scotland service on 0800 84 84 84 (8.00am to 10.00pm, every day). the specially trained helpline staff will offer you free expert advice and

symptoms you may experience after giving up.for more information and advice about giving up smoking, have a browse throughstop smoking treatmentsand thestop smoking home page.your risk of bladder cancer could be increased if your job involves exposure to certain chemicals. occupations linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving: rubber dyes textiles plastic leather tanning diesel fumesnowadays, there are rigorous safety protocols in place designed to minimise your risk of exposure, and chemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer have been banned. if you’re uncertain about what these protocols involve, talk to your line manager or health and safety representative.if you’re concerned that your employer may be disregarding recommendations about workplace safety, you should contact thehealth and safety executivefor advice.there’s some evidence to suggest that a diet high in fruit and vegetables and low in fat can help to prevent bladder cancer.even though this evidence is limited, it’s a good idea to follow this type of healthy diet, as it can help to prevent other types of cancer, such asbowel cancer, as well as serious health conditions, includinghigh blood pressure (hypertension),strokeandheart disease.a low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 portions a day) and whole grains. limit the amount of salt you eat to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day (1 teaspoon) because too much can increase your blood pressure.you should try to avoid foods that contain saturated fat, as it

       " 'Blood poisoning (sepsis)': 'you or someone else has symptoms like: loss of consciousness severe breathlessness a high temperature (fever) or low body temperature a change in mental state – like confusion or disorientation slurred speech cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin a fast heartbeat fast breathing chills and shivering severe muscle pain feeling dizzy or faint nausea and vomiting diarrhoeasepsis is a serious complication of an infection.without quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death.the immune system usually keeps an infection limited to one place. this is called a localised infection. to do this, the body produces white blood cells.white blood cells travel to an infection site to destroy the germs causing the infection. this triggers tissue swelling, known as inflammation. this helps to fight the infection and prevent it from spreading.however, an infection can spread to other parts of the body if the immune system is weak or an infection is severe.widespread inflammation can damage tissue and interfere with blood flow. when blood flow is interrupted, blood pressure can drop dangerously low. this stops oxygen from reaching the organs and tissues.sepsis can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body. the most common sites of infection that lead to sepsis are the: lungs urinary tract tummy (abdomen) pelvishowever, sometimes the specific infection and source of sepsis can’t be identified. appendicitis – infection in the appendix cellulitis – a skin infection that can be caused by an intravenouscatheterthat’s been inserted through the skin to give fluids or medication cholangitis – an infection of the bile duct cholecystitis – an infection of the gallbladder encephalitis – an infection of the brain and nervous system endocarditis – a heart infection flu – only in some cases meningitis – an infection of the brain and nervous system peritonitis – an infection of the thin

a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus blood pressure tests imaging studies – like anx-ray,ultrasound scanorcomputerised tomography (ct) scananyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection.

severity of the sepsis the person’s overall health how much time was spent in hospital whether treatment was needed in an intensive care unit (icu)some people with sepsis will experience long-term physical and psychological problems. this is known as post-sepsis syndrome.symptoms of post-sepsis syndrome include: feeling lethargic or excessively tired muscle weakness swollen limbs joint pain

has severe sepsis or septic shockdon’t be afraid to ask the healthcare professional ‘is this sepsis?’.treatment for sepsis varies, depending on the: area affected cause of the infection organs affected extent of any damageif you have the early signs of sepsis, you’ll usually be referred to hospital. you’ll then be given a diagnosis and treatment.you’ll need emergency treatment, or treatment in an intensive care unit (icu), if: the sepsis is severe you developseptic shock– when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low levelicus can support body functions like breathing that are affected by sepsis. this allows the medical staff to focus on treating the infection.sepsis is treatable if it’s identified and treated quickly. in most cases it leads to full recovery with no lasting problems.the main treatment for sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock isantibiotics. these will be given directly into a vein (intravenously).ideally, antibiotic treatment should start within an hour of diagnosis.intravenous antibiotics are usually replaced by tablets after 2 to 4 days. you may have to take them for 7 to 10 days or longer, depending on the severity of your condition.if sepsis is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given first. this is because there won’t be time to wait until a specific type of infection has been identified.broad-spectrum antibiotics work against a wide range of known infectious bacteria. they usually cure most common infections.once a specific bacterium has been identified, a more focused antibiotic can be used.if the sepsis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won’t work. however, it would be too dangerous to delay treatment to find out the specific cause. this means antibiotics are usually given anyway.with a viral infection, you’ll need to wait until your immune system starts to tackle it. however, antiviral medication may be given in some cases.if you have sepsis, your body needs more fluid to prevent dehydration and kidney failure.if you have severe sepsis or septic shock, you’ll usually be given fluids intravenously for the first 24 to 48 hours.it’s important that the doctors know how much urine your kidneys are making when you have sepsis. this helps them spot signs of kidney failure.if you’re admitted with severe sepsis or septic shock, you’ll usually be givena catheter. this is inserted into your bladder to monitor your urine output.your body’s oxygen demand goes up if you have sepsis.if you’re admitted to hospital with sepsis and the level of oxygen in your blood is low, you’ll usually be given oxygen. this is given through a mask or tubes in your nostrils.if a source of the infection can be identified, like an abscess or infected wound, this will also need to be treated.for example, any pus may need to be drained away. in more serious cases, surgery may be needed to remove the infected tissue and repair any damage.medications called vasopressors are used if you havelow blood pressurecaused by sepsis.vasopressors are normally given intravenously while you’re in an icu. extra fluids may also be given intravenously to help increase blood pressure.you may require additional treatments like: corticosteroids insulin medication a blood transfusion mechanical ventilation – where a machine is used to help you breathe dialysis– where a machine filters your blood to copy the function of your kidneysthese treatments are mostly used in icus. antibiotics uk sepsis trust nice: sepsis: recognition, diagnosis and early management sepsis research',\n",
       " 'Bone cancer': 'primary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones.this is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bones after developing in another part of the body.these pages only refer to primary bone cancer. the macmillan cancer support website has more information aboutsecondary bone cancer.bone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.the main symptoms include: persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night swelling and redness (inflammation) over a bone, which can make movement difficult if the affected bone is near a joint a noticeable lump over a bone a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normalif you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, visit your gp. while it’s highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation.read more about thesymptoms of bone cancersome of the main types of bone cancer are: osteosarcoma – the most common type, which mostly affects children and young adults under 20 ewing sarcoma– which most commonly affects people aged between 10 and 20 chondrosarcoma – which tends to affect adults aged over 40young people can be affected because the rapid growth spurts that occur during puberty may make bone tumours develop.these types of bone cancer affect different types of cell. the treatment and outlook will depend on the type of bone cancer you have.in most cases, it’s not known why a person develops bone cancer.you’re more at risk of developing it if you: have had previous exposure to radiation duringradiotherapy have a condition known as paget’s disease of the bone – however, only a very small number of people with paget’s disease will actually develop bone cancer have a rare genetic condition called li-fraumeni syndrome – people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cellsread more about thecauses of bone cancertreatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread.most people have a combination of: surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it’s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that’s been removed, butamputationis sometimes necessary chemotherapy– treatment with powerful cancer-killing medication radiotherapy– where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cellsin some cases of osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may also be recommended.read more abouttreating bone cancerthe outlook for bone cancer depends on factors such as your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade).generally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn’t spread.bone pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. some people experience other symptoms as well.pain caused by bone cancer usually begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone. this gradually progresses to a persistent ache or ache that comes and goes, which continues at night and when resting.any bone can be affected, although bone cancer most often develops in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.the pain can sometimes be wrongly mistaken forarthritisin adults and growing pains in children and teenagers.some people also experience swelling and redness (inflammation) or notice a lump on or around the affected bone. if the bone is near a joint, the swelling may make it difficult to use the joint.in some cases, the cancer can weaken a bone, causing it to break (fracture) easily after a minor injury orfall.less common symptoms can include: a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above unexplained weight loss sweating, particularly at nightspeak to your gp if you or your child experiences persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, or if you’re worried about any symptoms.while it’s highly unlikely that your symptoms are caused by cancer, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.read more aboutdiagnosing bone cancercancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. this produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.the exact reason why this happens is often not known, but certain things can increase your chance of developing the condition, including: previousradiotherapytreatment other bone conditions, such as paget’s disease of the bone rare genetic conditions, such as li-fraumeni syndrome a history of certain other conditions, including retinoblastoma andumbilical herniaprevious exposure to high doses of radiation duringradiotherapymay cause cancerous changes in your bone cells at a later stage, although this risk is thought to be small.some non-cancerous (benign) conditions affecting the bones may increase your chances of developing bone cancer, although the risk is still small.in particular, a condition called paget’s disease of the bone can increase the risk of bone cancer in people over 50 to 60 years of age.rarer conditions that cause tumours to grow in your bones, such as ollier’s disease, can also increase your risk of bone cancer.a rare genetic condition called li-fraumeni syndrome can increase your risk of developing bone cancer, as well as several other types of cancer.people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that usually helps stop the growth of tumours in the body.people who had a rare type of eye cancer called retinoblastoma as a child may be more likely to develop bone cancer, because the same inherited faulty gene can be responsible for both conditions.research has also found that babies born with an umbilical hernia are three times more likely to develop a type of bone cancer called ewing sarcoma, although the risk is still very small.if you’re experiencing bone pain, your gp will ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area, before deciding whether you need to have any further tests.they will look for any swelling or lumps, and ask if you have problems moving the affected area. they may ask about the type of pain you experience – whether it’s constant or comes and goes, and whether anything makes it worse.after being examined, you may be referred for anx-rayof the affected area to look for any problems in the bones. if the x-ray shows abnormal areas, you’ll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in bone conditions) or bone cancer specialist for a further assessment.an x-ray is a procedure where radiation is used to produce images of the inside of the body. it’s a particularly effective way of looking at bones.x-rays can often detect damage to the bones caused by cancer, or new bone that’s growing because of cancer. they can also determine whether your symptoms are caused by something else, such as a broken bone (fracture).if an x-ray suggests you may have bone cancer, you should be referred to a specialist centre with expertise in diagnosing and treating the condition. as bone cancer is rare, there are a small number of specialist centres, so you may have to travel outside your local area for advice and treatment.the most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. this is known as abiopsy.a biopsy can determine exactly what type of bone cancer you have and what grade it is (see below).a biopsy can be carried out in two ways: a core needle biopsy is performed under anaesthetic (depending on where the bone is located, this could be alocal anaestheticorgeneral anaesthetic). a thin needle is inserted into the bone and used to remove a sample of tissue. an open biopsy is performed under a general anaesthetic. the surgeon makes an incision in the affected bone to remove a sample of tissue.you may need to have an open biopsy if the results of a core needle biopsy are inconclusive.if the results of the biopsy confirm or suggest bone cancer, it’s likely you’ll have further tests to assess how far the cancer has spread. these tests are described below.amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanuses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the bones and soft tissues.an mri scan is an effective way of assessing the size and spread of any cancerous tumour in or around the bones.acomputerised tomography (ct) scaninvolves taking a series of x-rays and using a computer to reassemble them into a detailed three-dimensional (3d) image of your body.ct scans are often used to check if the cancer has spread to your lungs. chest x-rays may also be taken for this purpose.a bone scan can give more detailed information about the inside of your bones than an x-ray. during a bone scan, a small amount of radioactive material is injected into your veins.abnormal areas of bone will absorb the material at a faster rate than normal bone and will show up as “hot spots” on the scan.if you have a type of bone cancer calledewing sarcoma, you may have a test called a bone marrow biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the bone marrow (the tissue inside your bones).during the test, a needle is inserted into your bone to remove a sample of your bone marrow. this may be done under either local or general anaesthetic.once these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you what stage and grade the bone cancer is. staging is a description of how far a cancer has spread and grading is a description of how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future.a widely used staging system for bone cancer in the uk uses 3 main stages: stage 1 – the cancer is low-grade and has not spread beyond the bone stage 2 – the cancer has still not spread beyond the bone, but is a high-grade stage 3  – the cancer has spread into other parts of the body, such as the lungsmost cases of stage 1 bone cancer and some stage 2 bone cancers have a good chance of being cured. unfortunately, stage 3 bone cancer is more difficult to cure, although treatment can relieve symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer.being told you have bone cancer can be a distressing and frightening experience. receiving that type of news can be upsetting at any age, but can be particularly difficult if you are still in your teenage years, or if you’re a parent of a child who has just been told they have bone cancer.these types of feelings can cause considerable stress and anxiety, which in some cases can triggerdepression. if you think you may be depressed, your gp may be a good person to talk to about support and possibly treatment.you may also find it useful to contact thebone cancer research trust, which is the uk’s leading charity for people affected by bone cancer, if you need more information. if you’re a teenager you may want to contact theteenage cancer trust, which is a charity for teenagers and young adults affected by cancer.read more aboutcoping with a cancer diagnosistreatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have, how far it has spread and your general health. the main treatments are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.your treatment should be managed by a specialist centre with experience in treating bone cancer, where you’ll be cared for by a team of different healthcare professionals known as a multi-disciplinary team (mdt).members of the mdt will include an orthopaedic surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in bone and joint surgery), a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer) and a specialist cancer nurse, among others.your mdt will recommend what they think is the best treatment for you, but the final decision will be yours.your recommended treatment plan may include a combination of: surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it’s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that’s been removed, althoughamputationis occasionally necessary chemotherapy– treatment with powerful cancer-killing medication radiotherapy– where radiation is used to destroy cancerous cellsin some cases, a medication called mifamurtide may be recommended as well.surgery to remove the cancerous area of bone is an important part of treatment for bone cancer, although it’s often combined with the other treatments mentioned below.nowadays, it’s usually possible to avoid removing an affected body part completely (known as limb-sparing surgery), although up to 1 in every 10 people may need to have a limb permanently removed (amputation).limb-sparing surgery is usually possible when the cancer has not spread beyond the bone, and the bone can be reconstructed.the most common type of limb-sparing surgery involves removing the section of affected bone and some of the surrounding tissue (in case any cancerous cells have spread into the tissue).the removed section of bone may then be replaced with a metal implant called a prosthesis or a piece of bone from elsewhere in your body (bone graft).if the cancer is near a joint, such as the knee, it may be possible to remove the joint and replace it with an artificial one. read more aboutknee joint replacementand hip joint replacement.amputation may be necessary if limb-sparing surgery is not possible or has not worked well. for example, it may be necessary if: the cancer has spread beyond the bone into major blood vessels or nerves you developed an infection after limb-sparing surgery and the prosthesis or bone graft had to be removed the cancer has developed in a part of the body where limb-sparing surgery is not technically possible, such as the ankleyour care team will understand the shock and fear that you, or your child, may be feeling if an amputation is needed and should be able to provide you with counselling and other support. in some cases, your care team may be able to introduce you to someone who has already had an amputation.after an amputation, most people use an artificial limb to replace the limb that’s removed. these limbs are now very advanced and convenient to use. for example, people with an artificial leg are often able to walk, run and play sport, and have an excellent quality of life.after limb-sparing surgery or an amputation, you’ll need help to return to normal life. this is known as rehabilitation.rehabilitation will usually involve physiotherapy sessions, where you carry out exercises to help regain proper function in the treated body part, andoccupational therapy, where you’re taught skills to help you cope with day-to-day activities.after an amputation, you may be referred to a local limb centre for advice, support and rehabilitation treatment. read more aboutliving with an amputation.there are 4 ways chemotherapy can be used to treat bone cancer. it can be used: before surgery, to shrink the tumour and make surgery easier in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation) – this approach works particularly well in the treatment ofewing sarcoma after surgery, to prevent the cancer returning to control symptoms in cases where a cure is not possible (known as palliative chemotherapy)chemotherapy for bone cancer involves taking a combination of different medications that are usually delivered via a drip into your vein, or into a line inserted into a bigger blood vessel.the treatment is usually given in cycles. a cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to allow your body to recover from the effects of the treatment. the number of cycles you need will depend on the type and grade of your bone cancer.chemotherapy can damage healthy cells as well as cancerous cells, which means it often causes a number of side effects.common side effects of chemotherapy include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea mouth ulcers tiredness increased risk of catching infections temporaryhair loss infertilitymost side effects associated with chemotherapy should resolve once your treatment has finished. however, there is a risk you will be permanently infertile. your care team will provide more detailed information about the specific risk to your fertility.read more about theside effects of chemotherapyas with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used before and after surgery to treat bone cancer, or used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure is not possible.radiotherapy for bone cancer involves beams of radiation being directed at the cancerous section of bone by an external machine.this is normally given in daily sessions, 5 days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes. the whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.the radiation you’re exposed to during radiotherapy will mostly be focused on the cancerous cells, but healthy cells nearby can also be damaged. this can lead to side effects such as: reddening and irritation of the skin (this can feel much like sunburn) joint pain in the part of the body that is being treated feeling sick hair loss in the body part being treated tirednessthese side effects will pass once the radiotherapy has been completed, although feelings of tiredness may persist for several weeks.read more about theside effects of radiotherapyfor people with a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may be used alongside other treatments.mifamurtide is an immune macrophage stimulant. this means it works by encouraging the immune system to produce specialised cells that kill cancerous cells.it’s normally recommended for young people with high-grade osteosarcomas and is given after surgery, in combination with chemotherapy, to help prevent the cancer returning.mifamurtide is slowly pumped into one of your veins over the course of an hour (known as infusion). the recommended course of treatment is usually twice a week for 12 weeks, and then once a week for a further 24 weeks.mifamurtide can cause a wide range of side effects. these can include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea orconstipation headache dizziness loss of appetite tiredness and weaknessit’s unclear whether it’s safe to take mifamurtide during pregnancy, so as a precaution it’s important to use an effective method ofcontraceptionif you’re a sexually active woman. you will need to tell your mdt as soon as possible if you think you’re pregnant, and you should avoid breastfeeding while taking mifamurtide.once your treatment has finished, you’ll need to attend regular follow-up appointments to check the cancer hasn’t returned.you’ll be asked to attend frequent appointments in the first two years after treatment has finished – possibly every 3 months. these will become less frequent as the years go on.contact your specialist or gp if you developsymptoms of bone canceragain and think the cancer may have come

       " 'Bone cancer: Teenagers and young adults': 'this section about bone cancer is for teenagers and young adults. there are different types of bone cancer, and most of this information applies to all types. if you have a rare type of bone cancer and want to know more, you couldtalk to macmillan.if you’re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our generalbone cancersection.there are different types of bone cancer. the 2 most common bone cancers to affect teenagers are osteosarcoma and ewing sarcoma.osteosarcomas are most likely to affect bones in the leg, especially around the knee joint, but they can affect any bone.ewing sarcoma can affect any bone, but it’s most common in the pelvis (which is made up of the tail bone and the 2 hip bones), or in leg bones. ewing sarcoma can sometimes start outside the bone in the soft tissue. this is called soft tissue ewing sarcoma, and is treated in the same way. sarcoma is the name for a cancer that starts in any connective tissue, such as muscle, fat or cartilage.in this information we sometimes use the term ‘bone tumour’. this means the same as bone cancer.the cause of bone cancer is unknown. because it’s more common in young people, doctors think that it may be linked to the changes that happen when bones are growing. there is lots of ongoing research into the possible causes.people often think a knock or injury might have caused bone cancer, but there’s no evidence for this.remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.bone cancer symptoms vary, and not everyone will feel the same. many symptoms are similar to everyday aches and pains, so they can be mistaken for other things, like strains, sports injuries or growing pains.the main symptoms are: pain or tenderness – this may start as an ache that doesn’t go away and may be made worse by exercise or feel worse at night swelling around the affected area of bone – swelling may not show up until the tumour is quite large and it isn’t always possible to see or feel a lump if the affected bone is deep inside the body reduced movement – if the bone tumour is near a joint (like an elbow or knee), it can make it harder to move the joint; if it’s in a leg bone, it may cause a limp; if it’s in the backbone (spine), it may press on nerves and cause tingling and numbness in the legs or arms a broken bone – a bone may break suddenly, or after only a minor fall or accident if the bone has been weakened by cancer.there might also be other symptoms including: tiredness a high temperature loss of appetite weight lossif you have any of these symptoms, or you are worried that you may have a bone tumour, you should get it checked by your gp. they can talk to you about your symptoms, and arrangetestsif they feel they’re needed.remember – most people with these symptoms won’t have bone cancer.knowing what your bones do might help you understand what bone cancer is.bones are like human scaffolding. they help keep you upright. the human skeleton is made up of more than 200 bones of different shapes and sizes.bones do lots of important things: they work with joints and connective tissue so that you can move around they protect parts of the body from injury – for example, the ribs protect the heart and lungs they store calcium some bones contain bone marrow, which make blood cellsjoints help bones fit together so that we can move freely. there are different types of joint. some work as levers, like the finger joint. others are ball-and-socket joints, such as the hip joint. there are different types of connective tissue that help bones move: ligaments are tough cords of tissue that attach bones to each other cartilage is a slippery material that covers the ends of bones to stop them rubbing together muscles are made of tough, stretchy tissue and give strength tendons are strong cords of tissue that attach muscles to boneswe also have more information about: symptoms of bone cancer having tests for bone cancer treatment for bone cancer life after bone cancerif you’re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our generalbone cancersection.there are some tests you might have when you visit your gp or at the hospital. the tests will help the doctors see whether you have bone cancer.if you think you might have some of thesymptoms of bone cancer, you should speak to your gp.your gp will talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and usually arrange some tests, such as x-rays and blood tests. there may be a number of reasons why you’re feeling unwell, so it can be difficult to diagnose the problem straight away. if your gp can’t find the cause, you may be referred to a specialist at the hospital.the hospital you’re referred to will depend on the results of the tests. you may go straight to a doctor specialising in bone cancer, or you might see doctors with more general experience first.the hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the following tests: x-rays bone scans biopsies mriand/orct scansif you’re diagnosed with bone cancer and not already seeing a specialist bone doctor, you’ll be referred to one.if the tests show you have bone cancer, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general: blood tests tests to check your heart is healthy chest x-rays to check your lungs are healthy tests to check your kidneys are healthy – you may need to give a sample of pee (urine) to be testedthis may seem like a lot of tests, but they’ll help the doctors plan the best treatment for you.having tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends, your specialist nurse or your doctor can help.we have more information about: the bones symptoms of bone cancer treatment for bone cancer life after bone cancerif you’re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our generalbone cancersection.the information on this page is about ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. if you have a different type of bone cancer and want to know more, you cantalk to macmillan.the 3 main treatments for bone cancer arechemotherapy, surgery andradiotherapy. most people have a combination of these.your doctors will plan your treatment based on: the type of bone cancer you have where the cancer is the stage of the cancer (this means whether it has spread outside the bone) how fast-growing the cancer isif you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. they’ll be happy to help you understand what’s involved.you may be offered the opportunity to take part in a clinical research trial. these trials help doctors find new and better treatments for people with bone cancer. if your doctor thinks you are suitable for a clinical trial, they’ll discuss this with you.in this information we sometimes use the term ‘bone tumour’. this means the same as bone cancer.chemotherapyis when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. it’s an important treatment for bone tumours. it helps shrink the tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, and it can kill cells that have spread outside the bone. after your surgery or radiotherapy, you’ll usually have more chemotherapy.chemotherapy for bone cancer is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a picc line.you’ll have chemotherapy over a few days and then you’ll have some time off to give your body a chance to recover from any side effects. the days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. most people have several cycles of chemotherapy. you’ll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy.the type of chemotherapy you have depends on whether the tumour is an ewing sarcoma or an osteosarcoma.for ewing sarcoma, the drugs most often used first are vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide. giving these drugs together is called vide. you’ll usually have 6 cycles of vide.after your chemotherapy you may have surgery, or, if the tumour can’t be removed with an operation, you’ll have radiotherapy. some people have both surgery and radiotherapy. the team looking after you will decide on the best combination for you.if you have surgery, you’ll have more chemotherapy afterwards to help stop the tumour coming back or spreading to other parts of the body.at the moment, there is a clinical trial called euro-ewing 2012 that is comparing different combinations of chemotherapy treatments before and after surgery for people with ewing sarcomas. you can talk to your specialist doctor about whether you could take part in this trial.osteosarcoma is usually treated with 3 chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate, doxorubicin (adriamycin) and cisplatin. giving these drugs together is called map.you will usually have 6 cycles of chemotherapy in total. each cycle takes about 5 weeks. after the first 2 cycles, you’ll have surgery to remove the cancer.if the cancer has spread, you may also need to have surgery on another part of your body. for example, if osteosarcoma spreads outside of the main tumour, it usually spreads to the lungs. if the cancer has spread to your lungs, you may need a second operation to remove the cancer in your lungs. if you have bone cancer that’s spread, your doctors will talk to you about what will happen next.after surgery, you’ll have 4 more cycles of map chemotherapy. you may also be given a new treatment called mifamurtide (mepact), which helps your body kill tumour cells. your doctor will tell you if you can have this drug as well as your chemotherapy.different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. some people have just a few side effects and others have more. it’s hard to know how it’s going to be for you. most side effects are temporary and gradually disappear once treatment stops.the most common are a sore mouth,hair loss, tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection.the most common side effect of mifamurtide is having a high temperature or feeling cold and shivery for a few hours after it’s given.the surgery you have will depend on the type of bone cancer you have and where it is in the body.your surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, while trying to keep as much function in the limb as possible.most people with bone cancer have an operation called limb-sparing surgery. this means the surgeon removes the cancer without having to remove the arm or leg it’s in. you’ll have all the tumour taken away from your limb, including any bone and muscle affected by the tumour.it’s usually possible to remove the affected part of the bone and replace it with a custom-made metal fitting (endoprosthesis) or with a bone from another part of the body (bone graft). if the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, the whole joint can often be replaced with an artificial one. in some cases, the surgeon can remove the affected bone without replacing it with anything and without it affecting the way you move.if you’ve had chemotherapy, you’ll need 2 or 3 weeks to recover before you can have your operation. doctors will make sure that you’re well enough to have the operation. if you’ve lost weight or been off your food, you might need to build yourself up a bit before the operation. the hospital dietitian can help you do this. you’ll probably see a physiotherapist, who’ll give you exercises to strengthen your muscles.you may like to see the replacement part or endoprosthesis (often just called a prosthesis) that will be put in during your operation. if you would like to see it, your surgeon or key worker can usually arrange this.you’ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it supported and let it heal.you’ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. this stops fluid building up in your wound. a nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days.you won’t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you’ll be given fluids into a vein. this is called a drip.you’ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help. it’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. the pain usually starts to get better within 2 or 3 days. as time goes on, you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable.once you’re home, you should start to feel a bit better and stronger every day. but if you do have any problems, it’s important to tell your doctor or nurse right away, so they can deal with them quickly.after your operation, you will need to do lots of physiotherapy to help you make the best possible recovery. this can feel like hard work but is really important. your physiotherapist will tell you what exercises to do, and help you to do them regularly.if you notice any new redness, pain or swelling in the limb that’s been operated on, it’s very important to get in touch with your doctor right away. you might have an infection that needs treatment, so you’ll need to see the surgeon who did your operation without delay.there’s more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section onliving with and after bone cancer.sometimes the only way to get rid of the bone cancer affecting an arm or a leg is to remove the limb. this is called an amputation. it’s only done if there is no alternative. this is usually needed if the cancer has spread from the bone and has grown around nearby blood vessels. these need to be removed along with the cancer.some people choose to have an amputation rather than limb-sparing surgery. you should be given a chance to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of surgery with your team.an amputation may also need to be done if there’s an infection in the bone that doesn’t go away with treatment, or if the cancer comes back in the bone. every person and every tumour is different, so you might meet other people with the same type of tumour, who are having slightly different surgery. your specialist will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand what’s involved.your doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what’s involved. losing a limb can feel very scary and it might help to talk to your specialist nurse, key worker or a counsellor about your feelings. it might also help to talk to someone who’s had an amputation – your nurse or doctor can arrange this. it’s really important to get support at this tough time.you’ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that’s been operated on. there’ll be a tube, called a drain, coming from the wound. this stops fluid building up. a nurse will usually take it out after 3 or 4 days. you’ll also have a drip to give you fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again.you’ll probably feel a bit sore after your op, especially for the first 2 or 4 days, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help with this. it’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. as time goes on, you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. you may have pain that feels like it’s coming from the part of the limb that’s been removed. this is known as ‘phantom pain’. let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. there are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. it usually gets better and goes away in time.a physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. they’ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible.if you’ve had an arm removed, you’ll be able to get up and move around once you’ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don’t feel too sore. if you’ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. you’ll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days.once you’re up and about, you’ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. this is a big part of your recovery. your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger.it’ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won’t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis until this happens. in the meantime, you’ll be given a temporary prosthesis and learn how to use it in physiotherapy.you should be able to go home about 2 weeks after your operation.there’s more information about the long-term effects of amputation in our section onliving with and after bone cancer.radiotherapytreats cancer by using high-energy x-rays to destroy cancer cells.radiotherapy is mainly used to treat ewing sarcoma. you may have radiotherapy after your chemotherapy, or before or after having surgery.if you have osteosarcoma, you’re less likely to have radiotherapy treatment. but you might have it if an operation to remove the cancer isn’t possible. occasionally, people with osteosarcoma have radiotherapy after surgery to remove their cancer.radiotherapy is generally given every weekday (monday to friday) for 5 weeks. each treatment takes a few minutes.radiotherapy isn’t painful, but it can cause other side effects. after a few treatments you may begin to feel tired, and your skin may go red or get darker and feel sore or itchy around the area that’s being treated. this gets better once your radiotherapy treatment is over.other side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help.we also have more information about: symptoms of bone cancer having tests for bone

limb-sparing surgery, the limb might not work as well as it used to. physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. you’ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. these can be hard work, but it’s important to keep going with them.if you’ve had a knee joint replacement, you’ll be able to walk and swim, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. these activities could damage or loosen the new joint.it’s usually ok to run a short distance, for example for a bus. but running or jogging regularly wears out the new joint, so it’s best to avoid this. if your knee joint wears out or loosens, you might need to have it replaced after a few years.after a hip joint replacement, you should be able to do most of your usual activities, but you’ll probably be advised to avoid running and high-impact sports.if you’ve had a shoulder replacement, you’ll be able to move your arm below shoulder height the same as before, but you might not be able to lift your arm above your shoulder.if you’ve had an implant put into your limb while you’re still growing, you’ll need to have it lengthened as your leg or arm grows. some types of implant can be lengthened without an operation, but with others you’ll need surgery. your specialist or key worker can tell you what kind of implant you have.after amputation, you usually have an artificial limb fitted. this is called a prosthesis. there are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports.different types of prosthesis let you do different things. some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics.things may be tough as you get used to living with the changes in your body, but help is available. you might have lots of different emotions. you might be tearful, angry,

       " 'Bowel cancer': 'bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer.cancer can sometimes start in the small bowel (small intestine), but small bowel cancer is much rarer than large bowel cancer.bowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the uk.the 3 main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), changes in bowel habit – such as more frequent, looser stools – andabdominal (tummy) pain.however, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. for example, blood in the stools is more often caused byhaemorrhoids(piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually the result of something you have eaten.as almost 9 out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. they are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments.most people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following combinations of symptoms: a persistent change in bowel habit that causes them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain blood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching or a lump hanging down outside the back passage abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating,

also arrange for a simple blood test to check for iron deficiency anaemia. this can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel that you haven’t been aware of.in some cases, your doctor may decide it is best for you to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there is no serious cause for your symptoms.make sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age.read more aboutdiagnosing bowel cancerit’s not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk. these include: age – almost 9 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over diet – a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk weight – bowel cancer is more common in people who are overweight or obese exercise – being inactive increases the risk of getting bowel cancer alcohol and smoking – a high alcohol intake and smoking may increase your chances of getting bowel cancer family history – having a close relative (mother or father, brother or sister) who developed bowel cancer under the age of 50 puts you at a greater

are known aspolyps. however, if you develop polyps, it does not necessarily mean you will get bowel cancer.exactly what causes cancer to develop inside the bowel is still unknown. however, research has shown several factors may make you more likely to develop it.your chances of developing bowel cancer increase as you get older. almost 9 out of 10 cases of bowel cancer in the uk are diagnosed in people over the age of 60.having a family history of bowel cancer can increase your risk of developing the condition yourself, particularly if a close relative (mother, father, brother or sister) was diagnosed with bowel cancer below the age of 50.if you are particularly concerned that your family’s medical history may mean you are at an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, it may help to speak to your gp.if necessary, your gp can refer you to a genetics specialist, who can offer more advice about your level of risk and recommend any necessary tests to periodically check for the condition.a large body of evidence suggests a diet high in red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing bowel cancer.for this reason, the department of health advises people who eat

common in people who have had severecrohn’s diseaseorulcerative colitisfor many years.if you have one of these conditions, you will usually have regular check-ups to look for signs of bowel cancer from about 10 years after your symptoms first develop.check-ups will involve examining your bowel with a colonoscope – a long, narrow flexible tube that contains a small camera – that is inserted into your rectum.the frequency of the colonoscopy examinations will increase the longer you live with the condition, and will also depend on factors such as how severe your ulcerative colitis is and if you have a family history of bowel cancer.there are two rare inherited conditions that can lead to bowel cancer. they are: familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) – a condition that triggers the growth of non-cancerous polyps inside the bowel hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc), also known as lynch syndrome – an inherited gene fault (mutation) that increases your bowel cancer riskalthough the polyps caused by fap are non-cancerous, there is a high risk that, over time, at least one will turn cancerous. most people with fap will have bowel cancer by the time they are 50.as people with fap have such a high risk of getting bowel cancer, they are often advised by their doctor to have their large bowel removed before they reach the age of 25.families affected can find support and advice from fap registries such asthe polyposis registryprovided by st mark’s hospital, london.removing the bowel as a precautionary measure is also usually recommended in people with hnpcc because the risk of developing bowel cancer is so high.read further information: bowel cancer uk: risk factors bowel cancer uk: dietwhen you first see your gp, they will ask about your symptoms and whether you have a family history of bowel cancer.they will then usually carry out a simple examination of your abdomen (tummy) and your bottom, known as a digital rectal examination (dre).this is a useful way of checking whether there are any lumps in your tummy or back passage. the tests can be uncomfortable, and most people find an examination of the back passage a little embarrassing, but they take less than a minute.if your symptoms suggest you may have bowel cancer or the diagnosis is uncertain, you will be referred to your local hospital initially for a simple examination called a flexible sigmoidoscopy.in 2015, thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected bowel cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.a flexible sigmoidoscopy is an examination of your rectum and some of your large bowel using a device called a sigmoidoscope.a sigmoidoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a very small camera and light. it is inserted into your rectum and up into your bowel.the camera relays images to a monitor, and can also be used to takebiopsies, where a small tissue sample is removed for further analysis.it is better for your lower bowel to be as empty as possible when sigmoidoscopy is performed, so you may be asked to carry out an enema – a simple procedure to flush your bowels – at home beforehand. this should be used at least two hours before you leave home for your appointment.a sigmoidoscopy can feel uncomfortable, but it only takes a few minutes and most people go home straight after the examination.most people with bowel cancer can be diagnosed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. however, some cancers can only be diagnosed by a more extensive examination of the colon.the two tests used for this are colonoscopy and computerised tomography (ct) colonography.a colonoscopy is an examination of your entire large bowel using a device called a colonoscope, which is like a sigmoidoscope but a bit longer.your bowel needs to be empty when a colonoscopy is performed, so you will be advised to eat a special diet for a few days beforehand and take alaxative(medication to help empty your bowel) on the morning of the examination.you will be given a sedative to help you relax during the test, after which the doctor will insert the colonoscope into your rectum and move it along the length of your large bowel. this is not usually painful, but can feel uncomfortable.the camera relays images to a monitor, which allows the doctor to check for any abnormal areas within the rectum or bowel that could be the result of cancer. as with a sigmoidoscopy, a biopsy may also be performed during the test.a colonoscopy usually takes about an hour to complete, and most people can go home once they have recovered from the effects of the sedative.after the procedure, you will probably feel drowsy for a while, so you will need to arrange for someone to accompany you home. it is best for elderly people to have someone with them for 24 hours after the test. you will be advised not to drive for 24 hours.in a small number of people, it may not be possible to pass the colonoscope completely around the bowel, and it is then necessary to have ct colonography.find out more about what acolonoscopyinvolvesct colonography, also known as a ‘virtual colonoscopy’, involves using acomputerised tomography (ct) scannerto produce three-dimensional images of the large bowel and rectum.during the procedure, gas is used to inflate the bowel using a thin, flexible tube placed in your rectum. ct scans are then taken from a number of different angles.as with a colonoscopy, you may need to have a special diet for a few days and take a laxative before the test to ensure your bowels are empty when the test is carried out.this test can help identify potentially cancerous areas in people who are not suitable for a colonoscopy because of other medical reasons.a ct colonography is a less invasive test than a colonoscopy, but you may still need to have colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy at a later stage so any abnormal areas can be removed or biopsied.read further information: bowel cancer uk: diagnosis cancer research uk: getting diagnosed macmillan cancer support: symptoms of bowel cancerif a diagnosis of bowel cancer is confirmed, further testing is usually carried out to check if the cancer has spread from the bowel to other parts of the body. these tests also help your doctors decide on the most effective treatment for you.these tests can include a: ct scan of your abdomen and chest – this will check if the rest of your bowel is healthy and whether the cancer has spread to the liver or lungs magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– this can provide a detailed image of the surrounding organs in people with cancer in the rectumonce the above examinations and tests have been completed, it should be possible to determine the stage and grade of your cancer.staging refers to how far your cancer has advanced. grading relates to how aggressive your cancer is and how likely it is to spread.this is important, as it helps your treatment team choose the best way of curing or controlling the cancer.a number of different staging systems are used by doctors. stage 1 – the cancer is still contained within the lining of the bowel or rectum stage 2 – the cancer has spread beyond the layer of muscle surrounding the bowel and may have penetrated the surface covering the bowel or nearby organs stage 3 – the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes stage 4 – the cancer has spread beyond the bowel into another part of the body, such as the liverthere are 3 grades of bowel cancer: grade 1 – a cancer that grows slowly and has a low chance of spreading beyond the bowel grade 2 – a cancer that grows moderately and has a medium chance of spreading beyond the bowel grade 3 – a cancer that grows rapidly and has a high chance of spreading beyond the bowelif you are not sure what stage or grade of cancer you have, ask your doctor.if colon cancer is at a very early stage, it may be possible to remove just a small piece of the lining of the colon wall. this is known as local excision.if the cancer spreads into muscles surrounding the colon, it will usually be necessary to remove an entire section of your colon. this is known as a colectomy.there are 2 ways a colectomy can be performed: an open colectomy – where the surgeon makes a large cut (incision) in your abdomen and removes a section of your colon a laparoscopic (keyhole) colectomy – where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of colonduring surgery, nearby lymph nodes are also removed. it is usual to join the ends of the bowel together after bowel cancer surgery, but very occasionally this is not possible and a stoma is needed.both open and laparoscopic colectomies are thought to be equally effective at removing cancer and have similar risks of complications.however, laparoscopic colectomies have the advantage of a faster recovery time and less postoperative pain. it is becoming the routine way of doing most of these operations.laparoscopic colectomies should be available in all hospitals that carry out bowel cancer surgery, although not all surgeons perform this type of surgery. discuss your options with your surgeon to see if this method can be used.there are a number of different types of operation that can be carried out to treat rectal cancer, depending on how far the cancer has spread.some of the main techniques used are described below:if you have a very small, early-stage rectal cancer, your surgeon may be able to remove it in an operation called a local resection (transanal resection).the surgeon puts an endoscope in through your back passage and removes the cancer from the wall of the rectum.in many cases, however, a local resection is not possible. instead, a larger area of the rectum will need to be removed.this area will include a border of rectal tissue free of cancer cells, as well as fatty tissue from around the bowel (the mesentery). this type of operation is known as total mesenteric excision (tme).removing the mesentery can help ensure all the cancerous cells are removed, which can lower the risk of the cancer recurring at a later stage.depending on where in your rectum the cancer is located, one of two main tme operations may be carried out.low anterior resection is a procedure used to treat cases where the cancer is in the upper section of your rectum.the surgeon will make an incision in your abdomen and remove the upper section of your rectum, as well as some surrounding tissue to make sure any lymph glands containing cancer cells are also removed.they will then attach your colon to the lowest part of your rectum or upper part of the anal canal. sometimes they turn the end of the colon into an internal pouch to replace the rectum.you will probably require a temporary stoma to give the joined section of bowel time to heal.abdominoperineal resection is used to treat cases where the cancer is in the lowest section of your rectum.in this case, it will be necessary to remove the whole of your rectum and surrounding muscles to reduce the risk of the cancer regrowing in the same area.this involves removing and closing the anus and removing its sphincter muscles, so there is no option except to have a permanent stoma after the operation.bowel cancer surgeons always do their best to avoid giving people permanent stomas wherever possible.where a section of the bowel is removed and the remaining bowel joined, the surgeon may sometimes decide to divert your stool away from the join to allow it to heal.the stool is temporarily diverted by bringing a loop of bowel out through the abdominal wall and attaching it to the skin – this is called a stoma. a bag is worn over the stoma to collect the stool.when the stoma is made from the small bowel (ileum) it is called anileostomy, and when it is made from the large bowel (colon) it is called acolostomy.a specialist nurse, known as a stoma care nurse, can advise you on the best site for a stoma prior to surgery.the nurse will take into account factors such as your body shape and lifestyle, although this may not be possible where surgery is performed in an emergency.in the first few days after surgery, the stoma care nurse will advise on the care necessary to look after the stoma and the type of bag suitable.once the join in the bowel has safely healed, which can take several weeks, the stoma can be closed during further surgery.in some people, for various reasons, rejoining the bowel may not be possible or may lead to problems controlling bowel function, and the stoma may become permanent.before having surgery, the care team will advise you about whether it may be necessary to form an ileostomy or colostomy, and the likelihood of this being temporary or permanent.there are patient support groups available that provide support for patients who have just had or are about to have a stoma. you can get more details from your stoma care nurse, or visit the groups online for further information.ileostomy and internal pouch support groupprovides a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgerylearn more aboutcoping with a stoma after bowel cancerbowel cancer operations carry many of the same risks as other major operations, including bleeding, infection, developing blood clots, or heart or breathing problems.the operations all carry a number of risks specific to the procedure. one risk is that the joined-up section of bowel may not heal properly and leak inside your abdomen. this is usually only a risk in the first few days after the operation.another risk is for people having rectal cancer surgery. the nerves that control urination and sexual function are very close to the rectum, and sometimes surgery to remove rectal cancer can damage these nerves.after rectal cancer surgery, most people need to go to the toilet to open their bowels more often than before, although this usually settles down within a few months of the operation.there are 2 main ways radiotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer. it can be given before surgery to shrink rectal cancers and increase the chances of complete removal, or be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of cancer in advanced cases (palliative radiotherapy).radiotherapy given before surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in 2 ways: external radiotherapy– where a machine is used to beam high-energy waves at your rectum to kill cancerous cells internal radiotherapy(brachytherapy) – where a radioactive tube is inserted into your anus and placed next to the cancer to shrink itexternal radiotherapy is usually given daily, 5 days a week, with a break at the weekend. depending on the size of your tumour, you may need 1 to 5 weeks of treatment. each session of radiotherapy is short and will only last for 10 to 15 minutes.internal radiotherapy can usually be performed in one session before surgery is carried out a few weeks later.palliative radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions, with a course ranging from 2 to 3 days, up to 10 days.short-term side effects of radiotherapy can include: feeling sick fatigue diarrhoea burning and irritation of the skin around the rectum and pelvis – this looks and feels like sunburn a frequent need to urinate a burning sensation when passing urinethese side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has finished. tell your care team if the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome. additional treatments are often available to help you cope with the side effects better.long-term side effects of radiotherapy can include: a more frequent need to pass urine or stools blood in your urine and stools infertility erectile dysfunctionif you want to have children, it may be possible to store a sample of your sperm or eggs before treatment begins so they can be used in fertility treatments in the future.there are 3 wayschemotherapycan be used to treat bowel cancer: before surgery – used in combination with radiotherapy to shrink the tumour after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring palliative chemotherapy – to slow the spread of advanced bowel cancer and help control symptomschemotherapy for bowel cancer usually involves taking a combination of medications that kill cancer cells. they can be given as a tablet (oral chemotherapy), through a drip in your arm (intravenous chemotherapy), or as a combination of both.treatment is given in courses (cycles) that are 2 to 3 weeks long each, depending on the stage or grade of your cancer.a single session of intravenous chemotherapy can last from several hours to several days.most people having oral chemotherapy take tablets over the course of two weeks before having a break from treatment for another week.a course of chemotherapy can last up to 6 months, depending on how well you respond to the treatment. in some cases, it can be given in smaller doses over longer periods of time (maintenance chemotherapy).side effects of chemotherapy can include: fatigue feeling sick vomiting diarrhoea mouth ulcers hair losswith certain treatment regimens, but this is generally uncommon in the treatment of bowel cancer a sensation of numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet and neckthese side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished. it usually takes a few months for your hair to grow back if you experience hair loss.chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.inform your care team or gp as soon as possible if you experience possible signs of an infection, including high temperature (fever) or a sudden feeling of being generally unwell.medications used in chemotherapy can cause temporary damage to men’s sperm and women’s eggs. this means that for women who become pregnant or for men who father a child, there is a risk to the unborn baby’s health.it is therefore recommended you use a reliable method of contraception while having chemotherapy treatment and for a period after your treatment has finished.find out more aboutchemotherapybiological treatments, including cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab, are a newer type of medication also known as monoclonal antibodies.monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have been genetically engineered in a laboratory. they target special proteins found on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors (egfr).as egfrs help the cancer grow, targeting these proteins can help shrink tumours, and improve the effect and outcome of chemotherapy.biological treatments are therefore usually used in combination with chemotherapy when the cancer has spread beyond the bowel (metastatic bowel cancer).these treatments are not available to everyone with bowel cancer. the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has specific criteria that need to be met before these can be prescribed.cetuximab is only available on the nhs when: surgery to remove the cancer in the colon or rectum has been carried out or is possible bowel cancer has spread to the liver and cannot be removed surgically a person is fit enough to undergo surgery to remove the cancer from the liver if this becomes possible after treatment with cetuximabcetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab are available on the nhs through a government scheme called the cancer drugs fund. all these medications are also available privately, but are very expensive.further information is available from: macmillan cancer support: targeted therapies and immunotherapies for bowel cancer bowel

enhanced recovery programme after bowel cancer surgery helps patients recover more quickly.most hospitals now use this programme. it involves giving you more information about what to expect before the operation, avoiding giving you stronglaxativesto clean the bowel before surgery, and in some cases giving you a sugary drink two hours before the operation to give you energy.during and after the operation, the anaesthetist controls the amount of iv fluid you need very carefully, and after the operation you will be given painkillers that allow you to get up and out of bed by the next day.most people will be able to eat a light diet the day after their operation.to reduce the risk of blood clots in the legs(deep vein thrombosis), you may be given special compression stockings that help prevent blood clots, or a regular injection with a blood-thinning medication called heparin until you are fully mobile.a nurse or physiotherapist will help you get out of bed and regain your strength so you can go home within a few days.with the enhanced recovery programme, most people are well enough to go home within a week of their operation. the timing depends on when you and the doctors and nurses looking after you agree you are well enough to go home.you will be asked to return to hospital a few weeks after your treatment has finished so tests can be carried out to check for any remaining signs of cancer. you may also need routine check-ups for the next few years to look out for signs of the cancer recurring.if you have had part of your colon removed, it is likely your stools

       " 'Bowel incontinence': 'bowel incontinence is an inability to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. it’s also sometimes known as faecal incontinence.the experience of bowel incontinence can vary from person to person. some people feel a sudden need to go to the toilet but are unable to reach a toilet in time. this is known as urge bowel incontinence.other people experience no sensation before soiling themselves, known as passive incontinence or passive soiling, or there might be slight soiling when passing wind.some people experience incontinence on a daily basis, whereas for others it only happens from time to time.it’s thought 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their life. it can affect people of any age, although it’s more common in elderly people. it’s also more common in women than men.bowel incontinence is a symptom of an underlying problem or medical condition.many cases are caused bydiarrhoea,constipation, or weakening of the muscle that controls the opening of the anus.it can also be caused by long-term conditions such asdiabetes,multiple sclerosisanddementia.read more about thecauses of bowel incontinence.bowel incontinence can be upsetting and hard to cope with, but treatment is effective and a cure is often possible, so make sure you see your gp.it’s important to remember that: bowel incontinence isn’t something to be ashamed of – it’s simply a medical problem that’s no different from diabetes or asthma it can be treated – there’s a wide range of successful treatments bowel incontinence isn’t a normal part of ageing it won’t usually go away on its own – most people need treatment for the conditionif you don’t want to see your gp, you can usually make an appointment at your local nhs continence service without a referral. these clinics are staffed by specialist nurses who can offer useful advice about incontinence.read more aboutdiagnosing bowel incontinence.in many cases, with the right treatment, a person can maintain normal bowel function throughout their life.treatment will often depend on the cause and how severe it is, but possible options include: lifestyle and dietary changes to relieve constipation or diarrhoea exercise programmes to strengthen the muscles that control the bowel medication to control diarrhoea and constipation surgery, of which there are a number of different optionsincontinence products, such as anal plugs and disposable pads, can be used until your symptoms are better controlled.even if it isn’t possible to cure your bowel incontinence, symptoms should improve significantly.read more abouttreating bowel incontinence.bowel incontinence is usually caused by a physical problem with the parts of the body that control the bowel.the most common problems are: problems with the rectum – the rectum is unable to retain poo properly until it’s time to go to the toilet problems with the sphincter muscles – the muscles at the bottom of the rectum don’t work properly nerve damage – the nerve signals sent from the rectum don’t reach the brainthese problems are explained in more detail below.it’s important to discuss any bowel problems with your gp as there’s a small chance they could be a sign of a more serious condition, such asbowel cancer.constipationis a leading cause of bowel incontinence.in cases of severe constipation, a large, solid stool can become stuck in the rectum. this is known as faecal impaction. the stool then begins to stretch the muscles of the rectum, weakening them.watery stools can leak around the stool and out of the bottom, causing bowel incontinence. this is called overflow incontinence and happens most commonly in elderly people.repeated straining caused by constipation or faecal impaction can also lead to rectal prolapse, when part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your bottom. rectal prolapse may also lead to bowel incontinence.it’s difficult for the rectum to hold liquid stools (diarrhoea), so people withdiarrhoea(particularly recurring diarrhoea) can develop bowel incontinence.conditions that can cause recurring diarrhoea include: crohn’s disease– inflammation of the digestive system irritable bowel syndrome– a condition that causes a range of digestive problems, such as diarrhoea and bloating ulcerative colitis– inflammation of the large bowelthese conditions can also cause scarring of the rectum, which can lead to bowel incontinence.haemorrhoids(piles) are enlarged blood vessels inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus). symptoms include discomfort, itching, bleeding or a lump hanging down outside of the anus.in severe cases, haemorrhoids may lead to bowel incontinence.the sphincter muscles at the bottom of the rectum control the bowel. bowel incontinence happens if these muscles become weakened or damaged.childbirth is a common cause of damage to the sphincter muscles and a leading cause of bowel incontinence. during a vaginal birth, the sphincter muscles can become stretched and damaged, particularly as a result of a forceps delivery. other causes include a large baby, the baby being born with the back of their head facing the mother’s back (occipitoposterior position) and a long labour.sphincter muscles can also become damaged through injury, or damage from bowel or rectal surgery.bowel incontinence can also be caused by a problem with the nerves connecting the brain and the rectum. a nerve problem can mean your body is unaware of stools in your rectum, and may make it difficult for you to control your sphincter muscles.damage to these nerves is related to a number of conditions, including: diabetes multiple sclerosis(a condition of the central nervous system) stroke spina bifida (birth defects that affect the development of the spine and nervous system)an injury to these nerves, such as a spinal injury, can also lead to bowel incontinence.in some cases, bowel incontinence may result from a health condition such asdementiaor a severe learning disability that causes the person to lose bowel control.a physical disability can also make it difficult to get to the toilet in time.your gp will begin by asking you about the pattern of your symptoms and other related issues, such as your diet.you may find this embarrassing, but it’s important to answer as honestly and fully as you can to make sure you receive the most suitable treatment. let your doctor know about: any changes in your bowel habits lasting for more than a few weeks rectal bleeding stomach pains any changes to your diet any medication you’re takingyour gp will usually carry out a physical examination. they’ll look at your anus and the surrounding area to check for damage and carry out a rectal examination, inserting a gloved finger into your bottom.a rectal examination will show whether constipation is the cause, and check for any tumours in your rectum. your gp may ask you to squeeze your rectum around their finger to assess how well the muscles in your anus are working.depending on the results, your gp may refer you for further tests.during an endoscopy, the inside of your rectum (and in some cases your lower bowel) is examined using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end (endoscope). images can also be taken of the inside of your body.the endoscope checks whether there’s any obstruction, damage or inflammation in your rectum.an endoscopy isn’t painful, but it can feel uncomfortable, so you may be given a sedative to relax you.anal manometry helps to assess how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working.the test uses a device that looks like a small thermometer with a balloon attached to the end. it’s inserted into your rectum and the balloon is inflated. it may feel unusual, but it’s not uncomfortable or painful.the device is attached to a machine, which measures pressure readings taken from the balloon.you’ll be asked to squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles at certain times. you may also be asked to push the balloon out of your rectum in the same way you push out a stool. the pressure-measuring machine gives an idea of how well your muscles are working.if the balloon is inflated to a relatively large size but you don’t feel any sensation of fullness, it may mean there are problems with the nerves in your rectum.anultrasound scancan be used to create a detailed picture of the inside of your anus. ultrasound scans are particularly useful in detecting underlying damage to the sphincter muscles.defecography is a test used to study how you pass stools. it can also be useful in detecting signs of obstruction orprolapsethat haven’t been discovered during a rectal examination.during this test, a liquid called barium is placed into your rectum. the barium helps make it easier to highlight problems using anx-ray. once the barium is in place, you’ll be asked to pass stools in the usual way while scans are taken.this test is occasionally carried out using amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scannerinstead of an x-ray.treatment for bowel incontinence depends on underlying cause and the pattern of your symptoms.trying the least intrusive treatments first, such as dietary changes and exercise programmes, is often recommended.medication and surgery are usually only considered if other treatments haven’t worked.you may find it helpful to use continence products until your bowel incontinence is better controlled. most continence products are available for free on the nhs.anal plugs are one way to prevent involuntary soiling. an anal plug is made of foam and designed to be inserted into your bottom. however, they can be uncomfortable and they’re not really a long term solution.if the plug comes into contact with moisture from the bowel, it expands and prevents leakage or soiling. anal plugs can be worn for up to 12 hours, after which time they are removed using an attached string.disposable body pads are contoured pads that soak up liquid stools and protect your skin. they can be used in cases of mild bowel incontinence.single-use silicone inserts, which form a seal around the rectum until your next bowel movement, are also being investigated as a treatment option for moderate to severe bowel incontinence.your local nhs continence service can offer help and advice about continence products, and you don’t usually need a referral from your gp to make an appointment. these clinics are staffed by nurses who specialise in continence treatment.wear trousers or skirts that are easy to undo and have elasticated waistbands rather than buttons.disability rights ukoffers access to 9,000 disabled toilets around the uk with aradar nks key. the key costs £4.50 and is only sold to people who require use of toilet facilities due to a disability or health condition.bowel incontinence associated with diarrhoea or constipation can often be controlled by making changes to your diet.it may be beneficial to keep a food diary to record the effect of your diet on your symptoms.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has published dietary advice for managing diarrhoea in cases of irritable bowel syndrome. these guidelines can also be applied to people with diarrhoea associated with bowel incontinence.the advice from nice includes the following: limit fibre intake from wholegrain breads, bran, cereals, nuts and seeds (except golden linseeds) avoid skin, pips and pith from fruit and vegetables limit fresh and dried fruit to 3 portions a day and fruit juice to 1 small glass a day (make up the recommended ‘5 a day’ with vegetables) limit how often you have fizzy drinks and drinks containing caffeine avoid foods high in fat, such as chips, fast foods and burgersa high-fibre diet is usually recommended for most people with constipation-associated bowel incontinence. your gp can tell you if a high-fibre diet is suitable for you.fibre can soften stools, making them easier to pass. foods that are high in fibre include: fruit and vegetables beans wholegrain rice wholewheat pasta wholemeal bread seeds, nuts and oatsdrink plenty of fluids because this can help to soften your stools and make them easier to pass.pelvic floor muscle training is a type of exercise programme used to treat cases of bowel incontinence caused by weakness in the pelvic floor muscles.a therapist, usually a physiotherapist or specialist nurse, will teach you a range of exercises. the goal of pelvic floor muscle training is to strengthen any muscles that may have been stretched and weakened.you’ll probably be required to carry out the exercises 3 times a day, for 6 to 8 weeks. after this time, you should notice an improvement in your symptoms.check with your health professional before trying these at home.first, pretend you’re trying to hold in a bowel movement. you should feel the muscles around your anus tighten.next, sit, stand, or lie in a comfortable position with your legs slightly apart.squeeze your pelvic floor muscles for as long as you can, then relax. repeat 5 times.squeeze the muscles as hard as you can, then relax. repeat 5 times.squeeze the muscles quickly, then relax. repeat 5 times.if you find these exercises too difficult, try fewer repetitions at first and build them up. if they get too easy, try doing more repetitions. you can do the exercises without anyone knowing about them, so they should be easy to fit into your daily routine.bowel retraining is a type of treatment for people with reduced sensation in their rectum as a result of nerve damage, or for those who have recurring episodes of constipation.there are 3 goals in bowel retraining: to improve the consistency of your stools to establish a regular time for you to empty your bowels to find ways of stimulating your bowels to empty themselveschanges to your diet usually improve stool consistency (see above).establishing a regular time to empty your bowels means finding the most convenient time when you can go to the toilet without being rushed.ways to stimulate bowel movements can differ from person to person. some people find a hot drink and meal can help. others may need to stimulate their anus using their finger.biofeedback is a type of bowel retraining exercise that involves placing a small electric probe into your bottom.the sensor relays detailed information about the movement and pressure of the muscles in your rectum to an attached computer.you’re then asked to perform a series of exercises designed to improve your bowel function. the sensor checks that you are performing the exercises in the right way.medication can be used to help treat soft or loose stools or constipation associated with bowel incontinence.loperamide is a medicine widely used to treat diarrhoea. it works by slowing down the movement of stools through the digestive system, allowing more water to be absorbed from the stools. loperamide can be prescribed in low doses to be taken regularly over a long period of time.laxativesare used to treat constipation. they’re a type of medicine that helps you to pass stools. bulk-forming laxatives are usually recommended. these help your stools to retain fluid. this means they’re less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction.rectal irrigation or enemas are used when bowel incontinence is caused by faecal impaction and other treatments have failed to remove the impacted stool from the rectum.these procedures involve a small tube that is placed into your anus. a special solution is then used to wash out your rectum.surgery is usually only recommended after all other treatment options have been tried.the main surgical treatments used on the nhs are sphincteroplasty and sacral nerve stimulation. other treatments – such as tibial nerve stimulation, endoscopic heat therapy and artificial sphincter surgery – can also be used, but their availability on the nhs is limited.an operation called acolostomyis more widely available on the nhs, but it’s only used if other treatments are unsuccessful.a sphincteroplasty is an operation to repair damaged sphincter muscles. the surgeon removes some of the muscle tissue and the muscle edges are overlapped and sewn back together. this provides extra support to the muscles, which makes them stronger.sacral nerve stimulation is a treatment used for people with weakened sphincter muscles.electrodes are inserted under the skin in the lower back and connected to a pulse generator. the generator releases pulses of electricity that stimulate the sacral nerves, which causes the sphincter and pelvic floor muscles to work more effectively.at first, the pulse generator is located outside your body. if the treatment is effective, the pulse generator will be implanted deep under the skin in your back.the most commonly reported complications of the procedure are infection at the site of surgery and technical problems with the pulse generator, which require additional surgery to correct.read the nice guidelines onsacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence.tibial nerve stimulation is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence.a fine needle is inserted into the tibial nerve just above the ankle and an electrode is placed on the foot. a mild electric current is passed through the needle to stimulate the tibial nerve. it’s not known exactly how this treatment works, but it’s thought to work in a similar way to sacral nerve stimulation.nice concludes that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works.read the nice guidelines ontreating faecal incontinence by stimulating the tibial nerve.bulking agents, such as collagen or silicone, can be injected into the muscles of the sphincter and rectum to strengthen them.the use of bulking agents in this way is a fairly new technique, so there’s little information about their long-term effectiveness and safety.you should discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of this type of treatment in full with your treatment team before deciding whether to proceed.read the nice guidelines ontreating faecal incontinence with injectable bulking agents.endoscopic radiofrequency (heat) therapy is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence.heat energy is applied to the sphincter muscles through a thin probe, to encourage scarring of the tissue. this helps tighten the muscles and helps to control bowel movements.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recently produced guidelines on this procedure. nice concluded that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works.as well as the uncertainties surrounding this procedure, it is also expensive. therefore, it is usually only used on the nhs during clinical trials.read the nice guidelines ontreating faecal incontinence using endoscopic radiofrequency therapy.an artificial sphincter may be implanted if you have bowel incontinence caused by a problem with your sphincter muscles.this operation involves placing a circular cuff under the skin around the anus. the cuff is filled with fluid and sits tightly around the anus, keeping it closed.a tube is placed under the skin from the cuff to a control pump. in men, the pump is placed near the testicles, in women it’s placed near the vagina. a special balloon is placed into the tummy, and this is connected to the control pump by tubing that runs under the skin.the pump is activated by pressing a button located under the skin. this drains the fluid from the cuff into the balloon, so your anus opens and you can pass stools. when you are finished, the fluid slowly refills the cuff and the anus closes.the use of an artificial sphincter is a relatively new procedure, so there isn’t much good-quality information about its long-term effectiveness and safety.possible problems include infection, injury during surgery and the cuff becoming dislodged. in some cases, further surgery is required to correct problems.read the nice guidelines ontreating faecal incontinence with an artificial sphincter inserted through a cut in the abdomen.acolostomyis usually only recommended if other surgical treatments are unsuccessful.a colostomy is a surgical procedure in which your colon (lower bowel) is cut and brought through the wall of your stomach to create an artificial opening. your stools can then be collected in a bag, known as a colostomy bag, which is attached to the opening. urinary incontinence constipation colostomy education and resources for improving childhood continence (eric) nice: faecal incontinence age

       " 'Bowel polyps': 'bowel polyps are small growths on the inner lining of the colon (large bowel) or rectum. they are common, affecting 15% to 20% of the uk population, and don’t usually cause symptoms.polyps are usually less than 1cm in size, although they can grow up to several centimetres. there are various forms:bowel polyps are not usually cancerous, although if they’re discovered they’ll need to be removed, as some will eventually turn into cancer if left untreated.some people just develop one polyp, while others may have a few. they tend to occur in people over the age of 60.bowel polyps are caused by an abnormal production of cells. the lining of the bowel constantly renews itself, and a faulty gene can cause the cells in the bowel lining to grow more quickly.there may be a family tendency towards developing bowel polyps or bowel cancer.most people with polyps won’t be aware of them as they produce no symptoms and are often discovered by accident.however, some larger polyps can cause: a small amount of rectal bleeding (blood in your stool) mucus to be produced when you open your bowels diarrhoeaorconstipation abdominal painbowel polyps are usually found as a result of a bowel investigation for another reason, such as a sigmoidoscopy (examination of the last part of the bowel) or duringscreening for bowel cancer.if polyps are found, a colonoscopy or ct colonography is needed to view the whole of the large bowel and remove any polyps.there are several methods for treating polyps, but the most common procedure involves snaring the polyp during a colonoscopy. snaring is like cutting the polyp off with cheese wire and is painless.both of the above methods involve passing a flexible instrument called a colonoscope through your bottom and up into your bowel. the colonoscope has a wire with an electric current to either cauterise (burn off) or snare the polyp.in rare cases, polyps may need to be treated by surgically removing part of the bowel. this is usually only done when the polyp has some cell changes or is particularly large.after the polyp or polyps have been removed, they are sent to specialists in a laboratory, who will inform your consultant if: the polyp has been completely removed there is any risk of it regrowing there is any cancerous change in the polypif there is a cancerous change in the polyp, you may need further treatment (depending on the degree and extent of change). your specialist will be able to advise you on this.some people will need further colonoscopies because polyps can recur. polyps can sometimes run in families. this is uncommon, but means you’ll need colonoscopy checks at regular intervals.you might be asked to have repeat examinations at intervals of around 3 to 5 years to catch any further polyps that may develop and potentially turn into bowel cancer. bowel cancer',\n",
       " 'Brain stem death': 'brain stem death is when a person no longer has any brain stem functions, and has permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe.when this happens, a ventilator keeps the person’s heart beating and oxygen circulating through their bloodstream.a person is confirmed as being dead when their brain stem function is permanently lost.confirming death used to be straightforward. death was said to occur when the heart stopped beating and a person was unresponsive and no longer breathing. the lack of oxygen as a result of no blood flow, quickly led to the permanent loss of brain stem function.confirming death is now more complex, because it’s possible to keep the heart beating after the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning. this can be done by keeping a person on a ventilator, which allows the body and heart to be artificially oxygenated. however, that person won’t ever regain consciousness or start breathing again.once the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning, there’s no way of reversing it and the heart will eventually stop beating, even if a ventilator continues to be used.to save a person’s family and friends from unnecessary suffering, once there’s clear evidence that brain death has occurred, the person will be disconnected from the ventilator.the brain stem is the lower part of the brain that’s connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column).the brain stem is responsible for regulating most of the body’s automatic functions that are essential for life. these include:the brain stem also relays information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, so it plays an important role in the brain’s core functions, such as consciousness, awareness and movement.after brain death, it’s not possible for someone to remain conscious.brain death can occur when the blood and/or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped. this can be caused by: cardiac arrest – when the heart stops beating and the brain is starved of oxygen heart attack– a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked stroke– a serious medical emergency that happens when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or interrupted blood clot – a blockage in a blood vessel that disturbs or blocks the flow of blood around your bodybrain death can also occur as a result of: asevere head injury a brain haemorrhage infections, such as encephalitis abrain tumourthere’s a difference between brain death and a vegetative state, which can occur after extensive brain damage.someone in a vegetative state can show signs of wakefulness – for example, they may open their eyes, but not respond to their surroundings.in rare cases, a person may demonstrate some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings.however, the important difference between brain death and a vegetative state is that someone in a vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem, which means that: some form of consciousness may exist breathing unaided is usually possible there’s a slim chance of recovery, because the brain stem’s core functions may be unaffecteda person who is brain dead has no chance of recovery, because their body is unable to survive without artificial support.although rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead.these include drug overdoses (particularly from barbiturates) and severe hypothermia (where body temperature drops below 28c).therefore, a number of tests are carried out to check that brain death has actually occurred, like shining a torch into both eyes to see if they react to the light.after brain death has occurred, it may be possible for the person’s organs and tissue to be used in transplantations. this can often save or improve the lives of others.only 1% of people die in a way that makes organ donation possible. this means every opportunity for donation is very precious.specialist nurses will discuss the possibility of donation with families. this’ll be done in a sensitive way. they’ll also check the nhs organ donor register to see if the person had recorded a donation decision and share this information with the family. this lets the family know what their loved one wanted. it also means that nurses can check if this was their latest view.further information about organ and tissue donationthere are a number of criteria for diagnosing brain stem death.for a diagnosis of brain stem death to be made: a person must be unconscious and fail to respond to outside stimulation a person’s heartbeat and breathing can only be maintained using a ventilator there must be clear evidence that serious brain damage has occurred and it can’t be curedbefore testing for brain stem death, doctors must carry out a series of checks to ensure that the symptoms aren’t being caused by other factors, like: an overdose of illegal drugs, tranquillisers, poisons or other chemical agents an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia) severe under-activity of the thyroid glandonce these factors have been ruled out, tests are carried out to confirm brain death. the diagnosis of brain death has to be made by two senior doctors. neither of them can be involved with the hospital’s transplant team.the doctors will explain the tests to you and they’ll keep you informed about your loved one’s condition at all times.the doctors will run a series of tests. both doctors have to agree on the results for a diagnosis of brain death to be confirmed. the tests are carried out twice to minimise any chance of error.the tests used to determine whether brain stem death has occurred are outlined below: a torch is shone into both eyes to see if they react to the light. the cornea (transparent outer layer of the eye), which is usually very sensitive, is stroked with a tissue or piece of cotton wool to see if the eye reacts. pressure is applied to the forehead and the nose is pinched to see if there’s any movement in response. ice-cold water is inserted into each ear, which would usually cause the eyes to move. a thin, plastic tube is placed down the trachea (windpipe) to see if it provokes gagging or coughing. the person is disconnected from the ventilator for a short period of time to see if they make any attempt to breathe on their own.brain death will be diagnosed if a person fails to respond to all of these tests.occasionally, a person’s limbs or torso (the upper part of the body) may move, even after brain stem death has been diagnosed.these spinal reflex movements are generated by the spinal cord and don’t involve the brain at all. therefore, they won’t affect the diagnosis of brain death.',\n",
       " 'Brain tumours': 'a brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an abnormal, uncontrollable way. it can either be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4 according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment.this page gives general information relevant to both types of brain tumour.the symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain that’s affected. common symptoms include: severe, persistentheadaches seizures (fits) persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problemssometimes, you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may only develop very slowly over time.speak to your gp if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. while it’s unlikely to be a tumour, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.if your gp is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.more than 9,000 people are diagnosed with primary brain tumours in the uk each year, of which about half are benign and half are malignant. many others are diagnosed with secondary brain tumours.the exact reason why some people develop primary brain tumours is unknown, but it’s thought that certain genetic conditions – such as neurofibromatosis type 1 andtuberous sclerosis– and previousradiotherapyto the head increase your risk.the main treatment for most brain tumours is surgery, which aims to remove as much of the abnormal tissue as possible.it’s not always possible to remove the entire tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy and/orchemotherapymay be necessary to kill any abnormal cells left behind.for most benign tumours, treatment is often successful and a full recovery is possible, although there’s sometimes a small chance the tumour could come back. regular follow-up appointments will normally be recommended to monitor this.the outlook for malignant tumours is generally less good, although this varies depending on things such as where the tumour is in the brain, your age, and your general health. unfortunately, a cure is often not possible and most tumours will return after treatment.if a tumour does come back, treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and prolong life by controlling the growth of the tumour.as well as reading the separate pages on benign brain tumours and malignant brain tumours, you may find the following websites useful sources of information and support: the brain tumour charity brain tumour research cancer research uk: brain tumours macmillan cancer support: brain tumours malignant brain tumour (cancerous) brain and spine foundation: brain tumour the brain tumour charity brain tumour research',\n",
       " 'Brain tumours: Children': 'brain tumours are the most common tumours that develop in children. children of any age may be affected. boys are affected slightly more often than girls.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.a tumour in the brain can come from the brain itself (primary), or from another part of the body (secondary). this information is about primary brain tumours.symptoms will depend on the size of the tumour, where it is and how it affects that part of the brain. symptoms are caused by the pressure inside the head being higher than it should be. a growing tumour may push normal brain out of the way, or block the flow of fluid in the brain. doctors call this raised intracranial pressure, and it can cause symptoms such as:brain tumours can also cause problems with balance and walking, weakness down one side of the body, or changes in behaviour. some of these symptoms are common even without a brain tumour, and this can cause confusion in the early stages.the brain is contained within the skull, which protects it. between the brain and the skull, there are 3 layers of membrane called the meninges. these completely cover the brain and spinal cord and help to protect it. between 2 of these layers is a space that contains a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (csf), which circulates around the brain and spinal cord.the main parts of the brain are: the cerebrum – this is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain; it’s made up of 2 halves (hemispheres), it controls thinking, learning, memory, problem-solving, emotions and touch, and it also helps us be aware of our body position the cerebellum – this is the back part of the brain, and it controls movement, balance and coordination the brain stem – this connects the brain to the spinal cord and is in the lower part of the brain just above the back of the neck; it controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, eye movements and swallowingknowing what a test involves can make things a bit easier. the specialist doctor and nurse will explain things but don’t be afraid to ask questions.your doctor will want to hear about the problems your child has had recently, and will examine him or her properly. this will include looking into the back of your child’s eyes with an ophthalmoscope to check for swelling, which can be a sign of raised pressure in the brain. they’ll usually check other things like balance, coordination, sensation and reflexes.most children will have actor anmri scan, which looks in detail at the inside of the brain.a ct scan usesx-rays. it’s quick and often is the best first-line investigation, but it does not give as detailed pictures as an mri. it uses quite a lot of x-rays, and so it is important to make sure we do not use it on too many people if it can be avoided.an mri scan uses no x-rays, and gives more detailed pictures, but takes much longer. machines are noisy, and often children cannot lie still long enough to get proper images. it is sometimes necessary to have an anaesthetic for this scan.ordinary x-rays are not usually helpful for brain tumours.these are usually done to make sure it is safe to do an operation, and can also be used to help diagnose certain types of tumour.it’s often necessary for doctors to remove a small part of the tumour (biopsy) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. it means your child will need to go into hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic. the piece of tumour removed is then examined under a microscope by a specialist doctor called a pathologist.a biopsy isn’t always done; it is sometimes better to remove the whole tumour in one operation. in this case, it will be a few days before the exact type of tumour is known.sometimes, it may be safer to do the operation in two stages. part of the tumour might be removed in the first operation and the rest a few days later.there are different types of brain tumours and they are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. the main types are astrocytoma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma, but there are many other, less common types.brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).these remain in the part of the brain that they started in and do not usually spread into other areas. sometimes it may be difficult to remove a benign tumour, because of where it is and, in this situation, other treatments may be needed.the most common tumour of this type is a low-grade astrocytoma (also called low-grade glioma).these are most likely to cause problems by causing pressure and damage to the areas around them and possibly by spreading to the normal brain tissue close by.these tumours develop from the supporting cells of the brain known as glial cells, and are sometimes also called gliomas.these usually develop in the lower part of the brain, the cerebellum. they may spread to other parts of the brain or into the spinal cord, and treatment must include the whole of this.because there are different types of brain tumours, treatment will not be the same for everyone. the doctors will look at the type of brain tumour, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment.these are the main treatments used to treat brain tumours. your child may have one treatment or a combination of treatments.usually, a neurosurgeon will operate to remove as much of the tumour as possible. operations can be very long. it’s not uncommon for these to be more than 6 or 8 hours.sometimes, the fluid in and around the brain does not flow freely, as a result of the tumour or brain swelling. in this case, it may be necessary to place a fine tube (shunt) to drain excess fluid from the brain and into the lining of the tummy area (abdomen). you cannot see the shunt outside the body. another way of treating this is to create another drainage route for the fluid around the obstruction (called a ventriculostomy).after the operation, your child may spend some time in an intensive care ward or high dependency unit, so the nurses and doctors can keep a very close eye on them.once a diagnosis is known, a plan to treat any tumour left behind can be made. for benign tumours, there may be no further treatment, but for some, radiotherapy or chemotherapy will be required.radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy radiation beams. these are exactly the same as visible light, but instead of reflecting from the surface, the energy passes inside the body, where it causes damage to tumour cells.radiotherapy is delivered extremely carefully, using machines linked to the mri scans of your child’s brain. the process usually takes a few minutes each time, but often needs to continue for 5 or 6 weeks.sometimes more specialised types of radiotherapy may be used. your child’s oncologist will explain more about this.chemotherapy uses drugs to get rid of cancer cells. chemotherapy is given into the veins, and sometimes as a liquid or tablets by mouth. treatment is often quite prolonged, with periods of time in hospital and gaps when you will be able to return home. this part of the treatment is planned by an oncologist.the specialist doctor and nurse will explain your child’s treatment and answer your questions so that you understand what is involved.your child may need to take medicines for a while to reduce or control the symptoms of the brain tumour:these are medicines that reduce swelling and inflammation in the brain and can help with symptoms.these are medicines that help prevent fits, which can be a problem before or after operations on the brain. they may only be necessary for a short period, but sometimes are needed for longer.your child’s doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about what to expect. always let them know about any side effects your child is having. many side effects can be well controlled or made easier.both radiotherapy and chemotherapy can causehair loss. your child’s hair will usually grow back again after chemotherapy, although it may not after radiotherapy.tiredness is very common with both treatments and may continue for weeks after chemotherapy or radiotherapy finishes.radiotherapy and chemotherapy may make your child feel sick. this can usually be controlled well with anti-sickness drugs, which the oncologist will prescribe for your child.chemotherapy can increase the risk of infection. it’s important to contact the oncologist or specialist nurse straight away if your child has a temperature, any signs of infection or suddenly feels unwell.radiotherapy can cause a mild form of sunburn. the skin may become red, flaky or sore if your child has fair skin and may become darker and flaky if your child has dark skin. you’ll be given advice on looking after the skin in the treated area.trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. it’s important to realise that a clinical trial is not an ‘experiment’, and your doctor will always offer you what is believed to be the best available treatment. clinical trials are usually offered to explore ways of making new improvements to treatment, beyond what is already known.specialist doctors carry out many trials for brain tumours. if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. written information is often provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it is right for your child. you can also join a trial, and then withdraw if you change your mind at a later date.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.after treatment is over, your child will be seen regularly by specialists. this is to check their progress and how well they’re recovering from treatment. it is also to check that they don’t have any long-term problems from treatment.you can contact your child’s specialist doctor or nurse at any time if you have any worries about their health.sometimes treatments may cause possible long-term side effects that may develop later. your child’s oncologist or specialist nurse will explain the possible risk of any long-term effects in your child’s situation. children are monitored for any long-term problems following treatment so that they can be picked up and managed early on.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",
       " 'Brain tumours: Teenagers and young adults': 'this section is for teenagers and young adults. it’s about the brain and different types of brain tumour.any illness to do with your brain can be scary. understanding a bit more about how the brain works might help.the brain and the spinal cord make up the central nervous system (cns). the brain is the ‘control centre’ which coordinates most body functions. it is inside the skull, which protects it. the spinal cord is made up of nerves that run down the spine. it passes messages between the brain and the rest of the body.the brain and the spinal cord are covered by 3 thin layers of tissue called the meninges. between 2 of these layers is a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (csf). the meninges and csf help to protect the brain and spinal cord.the main parts of the brain are the: cerebrum cerebellum brain stem pituitary glandthis is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. it’s made up of 2 halves called hemispheres. it controls thinking, learning, memory, problem solving, emotions, and touch. it also makes us aware of our body position.this is at the back of the head, near the middle. it controls movement, balance and coordination.this connects the brain to the spinal cord. it’s in the lower part of the brain, just above the back of the neck. it controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing.this is in the middle of the brain. it makes hormones that control things such as growth, metabolism, periods, and sperm production.there are different types of brain tumour. they are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). this information is about both types.benign brain tumours often press on the brain but don’t usually spread into surrounding tissue. they are also less likely to spread around the brain and spinal cord. if they can be removed with an operation they may not cause any more problems. sometimes it’s difficult to remove a benign tumour because of where it is in the brain. in this case, you might need treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.some benign tumours can cause long-lasting changes. this can be because they increase the pressure inside the brain, or because they press on important areas of the brain.malignant brain tumours can spread from where they started into surrounding brain tissue, causing pressure and problems in those parts of the brain. they can also spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) into other parts of the brain or the spinal cord.this information is about tumours that start in the brain, which are called primary brain tumours. sometimes cancers that start in other parts of the body can spread to the brain. these are known as secondary brain tumours.the types of brain tumour most likely to affect teenagers and young adults are: pituitary tumours gliomas medulloblastomas germ cell tumoursthese start in cells called glial cells. there are different types of glioma, but the ones that affect younger people are usually astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. these types of tumour can develop in the brain or in the spinal cord.these are the most common type of glioma.astrocytomas develop from a star-shaped cell called an astrocyte. oligodendrogliomas look like a fried egg. sometimes tumours are a mix of both cells. these are called oligoastrocytomas. doctors group them by how quickly they grow (known as the grade of the tumour). they can tell the grade from how the cells look under a microscope.these are a rarer type of glioma. they develop from the spinal cord, and from cells that line the fluid-filled spaces (ventricles) in the brain. these tumours can spread to other parts of the brain and spine through the csf.these are usually benign tumours that grow in the pituitary gland. they are mostly grouped into pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas.some cause too many or too few hormones to be produced in the body. they very rarely spread.these usually start in the cerebellum, at the back of the brain. sometimes they can spread through the csf, or very rarely to other parts of the body. they start from cells that haven’t properly developed yet, and are sometimes called primitive neuroectodermal tumours (pnet).this type of tumour is rare. they develop from very early cells called germ cells, which have the potential to grow into any type of tissue.although germ cell tumours often develop in the ovaries in girls or the testicles in boys, they can also start in other parts of the body, including the brain. they may be non-cancerous or cancerous. they are called by different names depending on what the cells look like under a microscope.we also have more information about: symptoms of brain tumours having tests for brain tumours treatment for brain tumoursif you’re looking for information aboutbrain tumoursin people of all ages, read our general brain tumours section. we also have information aboutbrain tumours in children.this section on brain tumours is

parts of the body cause ‘raised intracranial pressure’ – there’s only a certain amount of space in the skull for the brain and as a tumour grows, there can be a rise in pressure in or around the braincommon symptoms of ‘raised intracranial pressure’ are: headaches, which are often worse in the morning vomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick fits (seizures) feeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day things like friends, school or going out problems with your eyes, such as blurring or seeing double feeling more sleepy or drowsy than usual changes in your balance and walking, or weakness down one side of the body problems with speech personality changesthere’s often a simple explanation for many of these symptoms. but if you have any of these or if you’re worried, it’s important to speak to your gp straight away.the cause of most brain tumours is unknown. research is looking into this all the time.young people with rare genetic conditions that run in families, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2, have an increased chance of developing a brain tumour.mobile phones, power lines and certain viruses have all been suggested as possible causes of brain tumours. there’s been a lot of research into these possible causes, especially mobile phones. but there has been no strong evidence for any of them.remember – nothing you’ve done has caused the tumour.if you think you might have any of the symptoms of a brain tumour, you should go straight to your gp. they’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. they can arrangeteststo find

people of all ages, read our general brain tumours section. we also have information aboutbrain tumours in children.this section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.your gp will examine you and, depending on your symptoms, they may arrange some tests. or they might send you to hospital straight away to see a doctor who specialises in problems to do with the brain. these doctors are called neurologists or neurosurgeons.sometimes a brain tumour is diagnosed after someone has been taken into hospital to check out symptoms that have happened suddenly, like having a fit.you’ll usually be seen at a hospital with a centre or unit specialising in treating brain tumours.your specialist will ask you questions about your symptoms and how you’ve been feeling. they’ll examine the back of your eyes using an instrument with a light on the end of it to check for swelling. swelling can be a sign of raised pressure in your head.they’ll usually check: your balance your coordination your muscle strength your reflexes whether you can feel pinpricks on areas of your skinyou might also have your eyesight and hearing tested.you’ll need to have some more tests before a diagnosis is made. your doctor will select the most suitable tests for your situation. these tests are important because they help your specialist plan the best treatment for you. your doctor and specialist nurse will explain things to you, but don’t be afraid to ask questions.macmillan cancer support has information on the possible tests, which include: act scanormri scan– these show a detailed picture of the inside of your head blood tests– these are done to check your general health and sometimes to measure the level of certain chemicals or hormones in your blood lumbar punctures – in this test a small needle is used to collect some fluid from the base of your spine; it’s sometimes done to look for cancer cells in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord x-rays– might be taken to check your skull and chestdoctors often need to remove a small part of the tumour (biopsy) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. the piece of tumour that’s removed is looked at under a microscope by a doctor called a pathologist. the operation will be done undergeneral anaesthetic. this is where you are put into a deep sleep. you’ll probably be in hospital for a few days.anmriorct scanis used to find the exact position of the tumour. the surgeon makes a small hole in the skull and passes a fine needle through it to remove a piece of the tumour.this is often used to make sure the doctor takes the biopsy from the most appropriate part of the tumour. you will have a head frame fitted that will help guide the surgeon to exactly the right place before they take the biopsy. this is called a stereotactic biopsy.having tests and waiting for results can be scary. remember – you don’t have to keep your worries to yourself. talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier. you could also talk to one of macmillan’scancer support specialistson their free helpline.this information is about having tests for brain tumours. we also have more information about: symptoms of brain tumours treatment for brain tumours the brainif you’re looking for information about brain tumours in people of all ages, read our generalbrain tumourssection.this section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.a team of specialists will plan your treatment. they will talk to you about the best treatment for you.it’s normal to have a combination of treatments, so you may be seen by different doctors, such as: a neurosurgeon, who specialises in brain operations a neurologist, who treats brain conditions a cancer specialist (oncologist), who treats brain tumours with radiotherapy and chemotherapyyou’ll usually see a specialist nurse who looks after people with conditions affecting the brain, or a specialist nurse for teenagers or young adults with cancer. if you have radiotherapy (x-ray treatment) you will be given this treatment by a radiographer.there are different types of brain tumours, so treatment won’t be the same for everyone. your doctors look at the type of brain tumour you have, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment for you.the main treatments for brain tumours are: surgery – an operation to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour radiotherapy– uses high-energy x-rays to treat cancer cells chemotherapy– uses anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cellsyour specialist doctor and nurse will explain your treatment and answer any questions you have. it’s important you understand what’s involved. you’ll probably need some time to talk it through with your family.you might need to take these medicines for a while to reduce or control the symptoms of the brain tumour: steroids, which can reduce swelling or inflammation in the brain and help with symptoms anticonvulsant medicines that help prevent fits (seizures)your surgeon will usually try to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour. before the operation, they will talk to you about what’s involved and the benefits and risks of the operation. it’s important you understand all this, so ask all the questions you want to.you’ll usually be in hospital for a week, sometimes longer. your doctor or nurse will tell you what to expect before and after the operation as it can be different for everyone.before the operation you’ll probably need to have some of your hair shaved off. this is done in the anaesthetic room. you may prefer to have all your hair shaved off. you can cover up with a wig or hat while it grows back.for some types of brain tumours, particularly low-grade gliomas, your surgeon might suggest doing an operation while you are awake. this is called an ‘awake craniotomy’. if you need this, you will be given plenty of medication to make sure it doesn’t hurt.sometimes surgery is not needed, or it’s not possible to remove the tumour. your specialist may think that another treatment would be better for you. they will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions to help you understand your options.after the operation you are monitored very closely for the first 12 to 24 hours. at first you might be attached to a machine called a ventilator that helps you breathe. your nurse or doctor will tell you if this is likely to happen.your head might be bandaged and you’ll have a tube draining any extra blood that’s collected around the wound into a plastic bottle. you may also have another tube draining extra cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds the brain). this is to make sure you don’t get too much pressure building up inside your brain. your doctor will remove these tubes as soon as it’s safe, usually after a couple of days.you’ll have a drip to give you fluids until you’re eating and drinking again. there may be some swelling and bruising around your face and eyes. this will settle down after a few days.when you wake up you might have a headache. you’ll be given painkillers regularly until this eases off. tell your nurse or doctor if you’re in pain so that they can give you something stronger.radiotherapyuses high-energy x-rays to treat cancer cells. it can be used: after the operation to treat any cells that may have been left behind instead of an operation when a brain tumour doesn’t need to be or can’t be removed if a brain tumour comes back after surgeryfor some brain tumours, it’s normal to treat your spinal cord (the nerves that go from your brain to your body) as well as your brain. your doctor will tell you if this is the case.there are 3 types of radiotherapy that are used to treat brain tumours: photon radiotherapy (given at your local hospital) proton radiotherapy (until 2018/2019 this is given in switzerland or america) stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (given at specialist hospitals in the uk)your doctor will discuss with you which treatment would be best.you’ll have your treatment in the radiotherapy department of the hospital. it’s usually given monday to friday, with a rest at the weekend. the number of treatments you have will depend on your situation, but it can last from 1 day to 7 weeks.you will have to wear a mask or shell to keep your head as still as possible during radiotherapy treatment. this makes sure treatment is delivered to the exact area each time. your mask is made before your treatment is planned. you’ll be able to see and breathe properly, but it might feel a bit tight. you only have to wear it for a few minutes at a time. most people find they get used to it pretty quickly. let your nurse or radiographer know if you’re worried about this.the treatment only takes a few minutes. it isn’t painful, but you need to lie very still. you’ll be on your own in the room but you can talk to the radiographer through an intercom. in some hospitals you can have music playing while you have your treatment.the side effects you might have will depend on the type of radiotherapy you’re having and how long it lasts for. your doctor and specialist nurse will tell you more about what to expect. always let them know about any side effects you’re having. there’s usually something they can do to make things easier.your hair in the treatment area will start to thin and fall out shortly after your treatment starts. your doctor or nurse can show you where you willlose your hair.losing your hair can be scary and really upsetting. there are lots of ways to cover up with hats, bandannas, baseball caps, scarves, or wigs until it grows back. getting a shorter haircut before it starts to fall out sometimes makes it a little easier to cope with.it usually starts to grow back within 3 months of finishing treatment. hair may grow back with a slightly different colour and texture and might not be as thick as before.although hair loss is usually temporary, for some people it can be permanent. your specialist will usually be able to tell you if this is likely. this can be hard to deal with and you’ll be given advice and support to help you cope.you might get some skin changes – a bit like sunburn – in the area being treated, usually after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. at first it can be dry and itchy. if you’ve got pale skin it might get red. if you’ve got darker skin it can get darker. you should wash and dry the skin gently using non-perfumed soap and use only the moisturiser that the radiographer gives you. the radiographer or specialist nurse will give you advice on looking after your skin.you may feel really tired towards the end of your treatment and for a few weeks after it has finished. this gradually improves after a few weeks. try to get plenty of rest. it’s also a good idea to do some gentle exercise if you can, like taking short walks. this helps to give you more energy and keep your muscles toned.let your doctor know if this is a problem. they can prescribe anti-sickness medicines to help.it’s important to tell your doctor if you have headaches. they can prescribe pain relief for you.during and after treatment, you might find your symptoms get a bit worse before they get better. this can be scary but it’s usually a reaction to the radiotherapy. it doesn’t mean the radiotherapy hasn’t worked or that the tumour has got worse. if it happens, let your doctor or nurse know.side effects that happen months or years after treatment has finished are called late (long-term) effects. these depend on the area of the brain treated. they can include patches of hair loss, worse concentration, memory changes and difficulty learning new things, reduced hormones, increased risk of a stroke, and a second tumour.you’ll be seen regularly for follow-up appointments and your doctors will be checking you for any late effects of treatment. your doctors will explain more about this to you.chemotherapyis the use of special anti-cancer drugs to destroy tumour cells. you might have chemotherapy: to shrink a tumour to make it easier to remove with surgery when it’s not possible to remove the tumour completely with surgery during radiotherapy to make the tumour more sensitive to radiation after radiotherapy or surgery to reduce the chance of the tumour coming back (adjuvant chemotherapy) when a brain tumour has come back after treatment.macmillan has information on the differentchemotherapy drugsthat can be used, such as: lomustine (ccnu) procarbazine vincristine cisplatin or carboplatin temozolomide (temodal®) cyclophosphamide ifosfamide etoposidethe information on these drugs is written for people of all ages, not just for young people. there are lots of other drugs that are used and your doctor or nurse can tell you more about this.you can also call macmillan’scancer support specialistsfor more information about chemotherapy drugs.chemotherapy can be given as a single drug or in combination with others. they can be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) or as tablets. occasionally chemotherapy is given directly into the spine (intrathecal chemotherapy) or into the brain through a special device (ommaya reservoir).another way of giving chemotherapy is for the surgeon to place a wafer containing chemotherapy in the area of the brain where the tumour was removed during the surgery. as the wafer dissolves, the chemotherapy drug is slowly released into the area of the brain that needs treatment.|chemotherapy causes side effects that usually get better when treatment is over.you need to let your doctor or nurse know immediately if you have signs of an infection like feeling hot and shivery. this is because you can become unwell quite quickly while you are on chemotherapy.this is a common side effect so it’s important to get plenty of rest. try to balance rest with some gentle exercise like short walks

there’s often something that can be done to control them.as part of your treatment for a brain tumour you’ll probably be given drugs called steroids. you may also be given some anticonvulsant drugs to prevent fits.steroids help reduce the swelling that often surrounds a brain tumour. although they don’t treat the tumour itself, they can improve symptoms and make you feel better. steroids are often given before and after surgery, and sometimes during or after radiotherapy and chemotherapy.it’s important to take steroids as your doctor tells you and not to suddenly stop them. if you take steroids for more than 2 weeks, it’s important to tell your doctor about them if you are unwell (for example an infection) over the next 6 months. this is because you may need an extra course of steroids.if you take steroids for some time, you may have some temporary side effects. these can include: weight gain a change in the shape of your face (making it more rounded) indigestion slightly more risk of getting an infection mood changes (feeling ‘hyper’ or overactive or feeling low) increase in the sugar level in your blood – your blood or urine may be tested to check for thisside effects can be hard to cope with, especially with all the other stuff you have to deal with. remember – the side effects will gradually get better when the steroids are stopped, and in the meantime there are lots of people who can support you.tumours in the brain can sometimes cause fits. anticonvulsant drugs can help prevent them. you might be prescribed these before surgery, or to take on a more long-term basis. your doctors will tell you about any side effects of these drugs.we also have more information about: symptoms of brain tumours having tests for brain tumours the brainif you’re looking for

       " 'Breast cancer (female)': 'breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the uk.most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases,men can also get breast cancer.if it’s treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body.the breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. when a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed.the body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. new cells are only produced when and where they’re needed. in cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.read more about thecauses of breast cancerbreast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.most breast lumps aren’t cancerous, but it’s always best to have them checked by your doctor. you should also speak to your gp if you notice any of the following: a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood) a lump or swelling in either of your armpits dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breastbreast pain alone isn’t a symptom of breast cancer.learn more about thesymptoms of breast cancerafter examining your breasts, your gp may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. this might include a mammography (breast screening) or abiopsy.read more aboutbreast screeningandhow breast cancer is diagnosedthere are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types.non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. this cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn’t developed the ability to spread outside the breast.this form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram. the most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis).invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn’t necessarily mean it has spread.the most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all breast cancer cases and is sometimes called ‘no special type’.other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer andpaget’s disease of the breast.it’s possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. if this happens, it’s known as ‘secondary’ or ‘metastatic’ breast cancer.there’s a good chance of recovery if breast cancer is detected in its early stages. for this reason, it’s vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their gp.mammographic screening (wherex-rayimages of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. however, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. it might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery.women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition.as the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50 to 70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every 3 years.women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their gp or local screening unit.the nhs is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47 to 73.read more aboutbreast screeningandfind breast cancer screening services near youif cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body.breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery,chemotherapyandradiotherapy. surgery is usually the first type of treatment you’ll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments.the type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you.in a small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it’s spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn’t curable, so the aim of treatment is to achieve remission (symptom relief).read more abouttreating breast canceras the causes of breast cancer aren’t fully understood, it’s not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether.if you’re at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk.studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain ahealthy weight,exercise regularlyand who have a low intake of saturatedfatandalcohol.it’s been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. if you’ve been through the menopause, it’s particularly important that you’re not overweight or obese. this is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.read more aboutpreventing breast cancerbeing diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways, depending on what stage it’s at and what treatment you’re having.how women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. you can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. for example: your family and friends can be a powerful support system you can communicate

cancer and another may not.however, there are risk factors that are known to affect your likelihood of developing breast cancer. some of these you can’t do anything about, but there are some you can change.the risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. the condition is most common among women over 50 who have been through themenopause. about 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50.all women who are 50 to 70 years of age should be screened for breast cancer every 3 years as part of the nhs breast screening programme. women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their gp or local screening unit.read more aboutbreast screeningif you have close relatives who have had breast cancer orovarian cancer, you may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. however, because breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, it’s possible for it to occur in more than one family member by chance.most cases of breast cancer aren’t hereditary (they don’t run in families), but particular genes, known as brca1 and brca2, can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. it’s possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. a third gene (tp53) is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.if you have, for example, 2 or more close relatives from the same side of your family, such as your mother, sister or daughter, who have had breast cancer under the age of 50, you may be eligible for surveillance for breast cancer or for genetic screening to look for the genes that make developing breast cancer more likely. if you’re worried about your family history of breast cancer, discuss it with your gp.read aboutpredictive genetic tests for cancer risk genesif you’ve previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast again.abenign breast lumpdoesn’t mean you have breast cancer, but certain types of lump may slightly increase your risk of developing it. certain benign changes in your breast tissue, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (cells growing abnormally in ducts), or lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells inside your breast lobes), can make getting breast cancer more likely.your breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules), which produce milk. this glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser. women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous.dense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, because it makes any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue harder to spot. younger women tend to have denser breasts. as you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.the female hormone, oestrogen, can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to grow. the ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you startpuberty, to regulate your periods.your risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen your body is exposed to. for example, if you started yourperiodsat a young age and experienced the menopause at a late age, you’ll have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time. in the same way, not having children, or having children later in life, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy.if you’ve experienced the menopause and are overweight orobese, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer. this is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, because being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.if you’re taller than average, you’re more likely to develop breast cancer than someone who’s shorter than average. the reason for this isn’t fully understood, but it may be due to interactions between genes, nutrition and hormones.your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with theamount of alcohol you drink.certain medical procedures that use radiation, likex-raysandcomputerised tomography (ct) scans, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer.if you hadradiotherapyto your chest area forhodgkin lymphomawhen you were a child, you should have already received a written invitation from the department of health for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer. speak to your gp if you weren’t contacted, or if you didn’t attend a consultation.if you currently need radiotherapy for hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.hormone replacement therapy (hrt)is associated with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. both combined hrt and oestrogen-only hrt can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, although the risk is slightly higher if you take combined hrt.read further information: breast cancer now:breast cancer causes macmillan cancer support: risk factors for breast cancerif you have suspected breast cancer, either because of your symptoms or because your mammogram has shown an abnormality, you’ll be referred to a specialist breast clinic for further tests.the tests you’ll receive at the breast clinic depend on your current symptoms, your age, and the results of the initial examination you’ll have when you arrive. many people don’t need any further tests after the initial examination.most of the time you can expect to spend up to 2 hours at the breast clinic.if you have symptoms and have been referred by your gp, you’ll meet a specialist who’ll examine you to determine if you need further tests.if you’re under 40 years of age, the specialist may suggest you only have a breast ultrasound scan. this is because younger women have denser breasts, which means a mammogram isn’t as effective as an ultrasound for diagnosing breast disease.if you have a mammogram, it will produce anx-rayof your breasts. you may also need anultrasound scan.ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, showing any lumps or abnormalities. your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.read more about breast screeningabiopsyis where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it’s cancerous. you may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see whether these are also affected.biopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your condition. different methods of carrying out a biopsy are discussed below.needle aspiration may be used to test a sample of your breast cells for cancer or to drain a benign cyst (a small fluid-filled lump). your doctor will use a small needle to extract a sample of cells, without removing any tissue.needle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. a sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using a large needle. you’ll have alocal anaesthetic, which means you’ll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb.your doctor may suggest that you have a guided needle biopsy (usually guided by ultrasound or x-ray, but sometimes mri is used) to obtain a more precise and reliable diagnosis of cancer and to distinguish it from any non-invasive change, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis).vacuum-assisted biopsy, also known as a mammotome biopsy, is another type of biopsy. during the procedure, a needle is attached to a gentle suction tube, which helps to obtain the sample and clear any bleeding from the area.read further information: breast cancer now: what happens at a breast clinic appointment? breast cancer now: your pathology results macmillan cancer support: breast cancerif a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests will be needed to determine the stage and grade of the cancer, and to work out the best method of treatment.if your cancer was detected through the nhs breast screening programme, you’ll have further tests in the screening centre before being referred for treatment.computerised tomography (ct) scans, or chest x-ray and liver ultrasound scans, may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to your lungs or liver. an mri scan of the breast may be needed to clarify or to assess the extent of the condition within the breast.if your doctor thinks that the cancer could have spread to your bones, you may need a bone scan. before having a bone scan, a substance containing a small amount of radiation, known as an isotope, will be injected into a vein in your arm. this will be absorbed into your bone if it’s been affected by cancer. the affected areas of bone will show up as highlighted areas on the bone scan, which is carried out using a special camera.you’ll also need tests that show whether the cancer will respond to specific types of treatment. the results of these tests can give your doctors a more complete picture of the type of cancer you have and how best to treat it. the types of test you could be offered are discussed below.in some cases, breast cancer cells can be stimulated to grow by hormones that occur naturally in your body, such as oestrogen and progesterone.if this is the case, the cancer may be treated by stopping the effects of the hormones, or by lowering the level of these hormones in your body. this is known as ‘hormone therapy’.during a hormone receptor test, a sample of cancer cells will be taken from your breast and tested to see if they respond to either oestrogen or progesterone. if the hormone is able to attach to the cancer cells (using a hormone receptor), they’re known as ‘hormone receptor positive’.while hormones can encourage the growth of some types of breast cancer, other types are stimulated by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2).these types of cancer can be diagnosed using a her2 test, and treated with medication to block the effects of her2. this is known as ‘biological’ or ‘targeted’ therapy.when your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. the stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) is sometimes described as stage 0. other stages of breast cancer describe invasive breast cancer: stage 1 – the tumour measures less than 2cm, the lymph nodes in the armpit aren’t affected, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body stage 2 – the tumour measures 2 to 5cm or the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body stage 3 – the tumour measures 2 to 5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding tissues, the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected but there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body stage 4 – the tumour is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)this is a simplified guide. each stage is divided into further categories: a, b and c. if you’re not sure what stage you have, ask your doctor.the tnm staging system may also be used to describe breast cancer, as it can provide accurate information about the diagnosis. t describes the size of the tumour, n describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and m gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.the grade describes the appearance of the cancer cells. low grade (g1) – the cells, although abnormal, appear to be growing slowly medium grade (g2) – the cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells high grade (g3) – the cells look even more abnormal and are more likely to grow quicklyread further information: cancer research uk: tnm breast cancer staging cancer research uk: stages and grades of breast cancersurgery is usually the first type of treatment for breast cancer. the type of surgery you undergo will depend on the type of breast cancer you have.surgery is usually followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. again, the treatment you’ll have will depend on your type of breast cancer.your doctor will discuss the most suitable treatment plan with you. chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment.most breast cancers are discovered in the condition’s early stages. however, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it’s spread to other parts of the body (known as metastasis).if this is the case, the type of treatment you have may be different. secondary cancer, also called ‘advanced’ or ‘metastatic’ cancer, isn’t curable and treatment aims to achieve remission (where the cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full).read further information about secondary breast cancerthere are 2 main types of breast cancer surgery. they are: surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour), known as breast-conserving surgery surgery to remove the whole breast, which is called amastectomyin many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed.studies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer.breast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where just the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where up to a quarter of the breast is removed.if you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on the: type of cancer you have size of the tumour and where it is in your breast amount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed size of your breastsyour surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer. if there’s no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there’s less chance that the cancer will reoccur. if cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast.after having breast-conserving surgery, you will usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.a mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple. if there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy.if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you will probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla (under your arm).breast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast. reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction). it can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast.read further information about breast reconstructionto find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be carried out.the sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. they’re part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). the position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they’re identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye.the sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. this provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread.if there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm.radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. it’s usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.if you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. you’ll probably have radiotherapy sessions 3 to 5 days a week, for 3 to 6 weeks. each session will only last a few minutes.the type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and surgery type. some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all. the types available are: breast radiotherapy – after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue chest wall radiotherapy – after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall breast boost – some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis) radiotherapy to the lymph nodes – where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodesthe side effects of radiotherapy include: irritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin fatigue (extreme tiredness) lymphoedema (excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm)read further information about radiotherapy for breast cancerchemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells. it’s usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven’t been removed. this is called adjuvant chemotherapy.in some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. this is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.several different medications are used for chemotherapy and three are often given at once. the choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it’s spread.chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you won’t have to stay in hospital overnight. the medications are usually given through a drip straight into the blood through a vein.in some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. you may have chemotherapy sessions once every 2 to 3 weeks, over a period of 4 to 8 months, to give your body a rest in between treatments.the main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells. side effects include: infections loss of appetite nausea and vomiting tiredness hair loss sore mouthmany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.chemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers.if you haven’t experienced the menopause, your periods may stop while you’re undergoing chemotherapy treatment. after you’ve finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again.however, this doesn’t always happen and you may enter anearly menopause. this is more likely in women over 40 years old, because they’re closer to menopausal age. your doctor will discuss with you the impact that any treatment will have on your fertility.chemotherapy for secondary breast cancerif your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy won’t cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumour, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life.read further information about chemotherapy for breast cancersome breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body.these types of cancer are known as hormone-receptor-positive cancers. hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects.the type of hormone therapy you’ll have will depend on the stage and grade of your cancer, which hormone it’s sensitive to, your age, whether you’ve experienced the menopause and what other type of treatment you’re having.you’ll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it’s sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour, making it easier to remove.hormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you from having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.in most cases, you’ll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after having surgery. if your breast cancer isn’t sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect.tamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. it’s taken every day as a tablet or liquid. it can cause several side effects, including: tiredness changes to your periods nausea and vomiting hot flushes aching joints headaches weight gainif you’ve experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor. this type of medication works by blocking aromatase, a substance that helps produce oestrogen in the body after the menopause. before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries.three aromatase inhibitors may be offered. these are anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. these are taken as a tablet once a day. side effects include: hot flushes and sweats lack of interest in sex (loss of libido) nausea and vomiting tiredness aching joints and bone pain headaches skin rashesin women who haven’t experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries. ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen.ablation can be carried out using surgery or radiotherapy. it stops the ovaries working permanently and means you’ll experience the menopause early.ovarian suppression involves using a medication called goserelin, which is a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (lhrha). your periods will stop while you’re taking it, although they should start again once your treatment is complete.if you’re approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin.goserelin is taken as an injection once a month and can cause menopausal side effects, including: hot flushes and sweats mood swings trouble sleepingread further information about hormone therapysome breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2). these cancers are called her2-positive. biological therapy works by stopping the effects of her2 and by helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells.if you have high levels of the her2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you’ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. trastuzumab, also known by the brand name herceptin, is usually used after chemotherapy.trastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. antibodies occur naturally in your body and are made by your immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. the trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells that are her2-positive.trastuzumab is usually given intravenously, through a drip. it’s also sometimes available as an injection under the skin (a subcutaneous injection).you will have the treatment in hospital. each treatment session takes up to one hour and the number of sessions you need will depend on whether you have early or more advanced breast cancer. on average, you’ll need a session once every three weeks for early breast cancer, and weekly sessions if your cancer is more advanced.trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. this means that it’s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such asangina, uncontrolledhigh blood pressure (hypertension)or heart valve disease. if you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll have regular tests on your heart to make sure it’s not causing any problems.other side effects of trastuzumab may include: an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever diarrhoea tiredness aches and painsa great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment.these advances were discovered inclinical trials, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.all cancer trials in the uk are carefully overseen to ensure they’re worthwhile and safely conducted. in fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those in routine care.if you’re asked to take part in a trial, you’ll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you’ll be asked to sign a consent form. you can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.read further information: breast cancer now: clinical trials against breast cancer: our

breast cancer. if you have been through themenopause, it’s particularly important that you’re not overweight orobese. this is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.studies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don’t. the reasons aren’t fully understood, but it could be because women don’t ovulate as regularly while they’rebreastfeedingand oestrogen levels remain stable.if you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, treatment is available to reduce your risk.your level of risk is determined by factors such as your age, your family’s medical history and the results of genetic tests.you will usually be referred to a specialist genetics service if it’s thought you have an increased risk of breast cancer. healthcare professionals working at these services should discuss treatment options with you.the 2 main treatments are surgery to remove the breasts (mastectomy) or medication.amastectomyis surgery to remove the breasts. it can be used to treat breast cancer and reduce the chances of developing the condition in the small number of women from high-risk families.by removing as much breast tissue as possible, a mastectomy can reduce your risk of breast cancer by up to 90%.however, like all operations, there’s a risk of complications, and having your breasts removed can have a significant effect on your body image and sexual relationships.if you want to, you can usually choose to havebreast reconstructioneither during the mastectomy operation, or at a later date. during breast reconstruction surgery, your original breast shape is recreated using either breast implants or tissue from elsewhere in your body.an alternative is to use breast prostheses. these are artificial breasts that can be worn inside your bra.read more aboutyour body and your breasts after treatmentin 2013, thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)announced that 2 medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the nhs for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.either tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who’ve been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven’t.these medications may not be suitable if in the past you’ve had blood clots orwomb cancer, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future.women who’ve already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts won’t be offered these medications, because their risk of developing breast cancer is very small.a course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.raloxifene can cause side effects includingflu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your periods, and nausea and vomiting.your chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increase while you’re taking tamoxifen, so you’ll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. the medication can also increase your risk of blood clots, so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before having any planned surgery.tamoxifen and raloxifene aren’t currently licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased risk of developing the condition. however, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks, and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.read further

       " 'Breast cancer (male)': 'breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it.it’s much less common in men than women.the cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. the most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts.however, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition calledgynaecomastia. this is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge.read more about thesymptoms of male breast canceryou should always talk to your gp if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge.while these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further.the cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include: age – most cases affect men over the age of 60 having a family history of breast cancer (male or female) obesity– abody mass index (bmi)of 30 or moreread more aboutcauses of breast cancer in menin most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. this may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually a drug called tamoxifen.tamoxifen helps block the effects of hormones known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells in breast tissue. it should help prevent the cancer returning.in some cases,radiotherapyorchemotherapymay be used for the same purpose.read more abouttreating breast cancer in menthe outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. this is because there’s reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose.the survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it’s diagnosed.breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue.unfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread.read more aboutdiagnosing breast cancer in men.the most effective way of reducing your risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, is to: drink alcohol in moderation maintain a healthy weight– through a combination of eating ahealthy dietand exercising regularlyread more aboutpreventing cancerthe main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. the lump is almost always painless.the lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple).however, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition calledgynaecomastia. this is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.less common symptoms of male breast cancer include: the nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction) the nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration) fluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge)additional symptoms usually only develop if the cancer spreads from the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver or lungs. this is known as metastatic breast cancer.symptoms of metastatic breast cancer include: bone pain swelling of the lymph nodes (glands), usually in or around the armpit shortness of breath feeling unusually tired all the time feeling sick (nausea) itchy skin with yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)you should always visit your gp if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as retraction, ulceration or discharge.these problems are unlikely to be of the result of breast cancer, but they should be investigated further.it’s not clear exactly what causes breast cancer in men, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.like many cancers, men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer as they get older. most cases are diagnosed in men aged 60 to 70. it’s rare for young men to develop the condition.a genetic mutation is a permanent alteration in the dna sequence that makes up a gene. the result is that one or more of the body’s processes may not work in the way they should.there are a number of genetic mutations known to increase your risk of developing breast cancer. the most significant mutation identified is known as the brca2 mutation.there’s also evidence that breast cancer can run in families, especially in men who have a first-degree relative who has developed breast cancer, such as a mother or sister.routine testing for the faulty genes that cause breast cancer in men isn’t usually carried out on the nhs, unless specifically requested by a specialist. however, some private clinics may offer gene testing. tests can be expensive, with prices ranging from around £2,000 to £3,000.there’s evidence that high levels of the hormone oestrogen, or prolonged exposure to it, can increase the risk of breast cancer in men.compared with women, men tend to have low levels of oestrogen, but there are circumstances that can increase the levels of oestrogen in men. these include: hormone treatments – man-made (synthetic) versions of oestrogen are often used to treat prostate cancer, and are also given to transgender patients undergoing a male to female sex change obesity – obese men have higher levels of oestrogen than normal cirrhosis– this is scarring of the liver, often caused by long-termalcohol misusethere is also a rare genetic condition affecting males calledklinefelter syndrome. this is a congenital condition that boys are born with that means those who are affected produce less of the hormone testosterone than usual.as testosterone usually helps to limit the effect of oestrogen, men with klinefelter syndrome are more likely to develop breast cancer than the general male population.there’s some evidence men who work in hot environments are twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with men who work in cooler environments.environments linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in men include: blast furnaces steelworks rolling mills – a factory where metal (usually steel) is shaped using rollers car manufacturing plantsone hypothesis to help explain the link between working environment and the increased risk of developing breast cancer is that excessive heat may damage the testicles, which could lead to an increase in oestrogen levels.another hypothesis is that working in hot environments usually involves exposure to certain chemicals that may increase the risk of developing breast cancer in men.rates of breast cancer are also unusually high in men who manufacture perfumes and soaps. they are 7 times more likely to develop breast cancer than the male population at large.the reason for this increased risk is still unclear. exposure to certain chemicals seems to be an obvious possibility, but this hasn’t yet been proven.exposure to radiation has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men.research has found men who received a course ofradiotherapy– where high energy x-rays are used to kill cancerous cells – directed at the upper chest were seven times more likely to develop male breast cancer compared with the population at large.however, even a seven-fold increase means the chance of developing breast cancer is still very low.if you have symptoms of breast cancer, such as a hard, painless lump in one of your breasts, your gp will carefully examine you.during the examination, they’ll also look for other possible signs of male breast cancer, such as swollen lymph nodes (glands).it’s likely your gp will refer you for further tests if there’s a possibility you may have breast cancer.a mammogram is a type ofx-rayused to help determine whether there are any changes in breast tissue that could be the result of cancer.during the mammogram procedure, a radiographer (a specialist in taking x-rays) will compress one of your breasts between two x-ray plates. this shouldn’t be painful, but you should tell the radiographer if you find it uncomfortable.once your breast has been correctly positioned, an x-ray will be taken that produces a clear image of the inside of your breast. the procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.anultrasound scanuses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, in the same way an unborn baby can be seen in the womb.an ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image of the inside of your breasts on a screen. the image will highlight any lumps or abnormalities that may be present in your breasts.abiopsymay be recommended if a mammogram or ultrasound scan highlight any lumps or abnormalities in your breasts.a biopsy is a test that can either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of breast cancer in men. it involves taking a sample of suspected cancerous tissue and examining it in a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.a type of biopsy known as a core biopsy is usually recommended for the diagnosis of breast cancer in men. this type of biopsy can usually indicate whether the cancer has started to spread from the breast into the surrounding area.during a core biopsy, alocal anaestheticwill be used to numb your breast. a hollow needle will then be used to remove a number of small tissue samples from the breast lump.if cancer is found, it’s also possible to check whether there are special proteins, known as oestrogen receptors, on the surface of the cancerous cells.this is important, because if oestrogen receptors are found – and they are in more than half of cases – it’s possible to treat the cancer with hormone therapy.readtreating breast cancer in menfor more information.after breast cancer has been diagnosed, your care team should provide information about the stage of the cancer. staging is a system used to describe how far a cancer has spread at the point of diagnosis.a cure may be possible if breast cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. however, treatment can only be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer if it’s diagnosed at a later stage. unfortunately, more than 40% of breast cancers in men are diagnosed at a late stage.in some cases, men are diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis). this means there are cancer cells in the breast, but they’re contained within the breast ducts and can’t spread.if left untreated, dcis can lead to invasive breast cancer over a period of time.being told you have breast cancer can cause a wide range of emotions, such as shock, fear, confusion and, in some cases, embarrassment.most people assume breast cancer only affects women, so it can be difficult to come to terms with the diagnosis.feelings of isolation and being alone are common in men with breast cancer. this may be because there’s little in the way of advice and support for men with breast cancer, particularly when compared with the support available for women with the condition.sometimes men who find themselves in this situation can become depressed. you may bedepressedif you’ve felt very down and no longer interested in doing activities you used to enjoy during the past month.if you think you may be depressed, visit your gp. there is a range of effective treatments, such as medication and counselling, that can help relieve feelings of depression.you may also find it useful to talk to other men affected by the condition.breast cancer nowis a breast cancer charity that provides anonline forum for anyone diagnosed with breast cancer. cancer research uk also providescancer chat, an online forum for anyone affected by cancer.as breast cancer is rare in men, routine screening for the condition isn’t recommended, even for men in high-risk groups, such as those with a family history of breast cancer or those who have hadradiotherapy.treatment for breast cancer in men largely depends on how far the cancer has spread.most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (mdts) to treat men with breast cancer. these are teams of specialists who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. your cancer team will recommend what they think is the ideal treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you’d like to ask the specialist. for example, you could ask about the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.your recommended treatment plan depends on how far the cancer has spread. if the cancer hasn’t spread significantly beyond your breast, a complete cure may be possible.in these cases, surgery to remove the affected breast is usually recommended. this is often followed byradiotherapy, hormone therapy, orchemotherapyto help prevent the cancer returning.if the cancer has spread beyond your breast into other parts of your body, such as your lungs, a complete cure won’t be possible. however, hormone therapy and chemotherapy can be used to relieve symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer.more information about these treatments can be found below.an operation called amastectomyis usually recommended as the first treatment for breast cancer.a mastectomy involves removing the entire breast, sometimes with the nipple and lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit. a procedure known as a sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed.in some cases, part of the muscle under the breast may also be removed if there’s a risk the cancer has spread to this area.once surgery has been completed, there will be a straight scar across your chest where your nipple used to be and possibly an indentation around the area where the breast tissue used to be.most men are well enough to leave hospital 1 to 3 days after surgery.after the operation, it’s likely you’ll feel very tired and it may take a few weeks before you’re well enough to start carrying out relatively strenuous activities, such as lifting objects or driving. your specialist nurse will be able to offer more specific advice about this.the wound takes about 2 to 3 weeks to heal. it’s important to keep the wound clean during this time.you should look for any signs that the wound may have become infected, such as redness and swelling around the wound or a discharge of pus. inform your mdt as soon as possible if you suspect an infection.it’s difficult to predict when you’ll feel able to return to work. some people choose to remain off work until other treatments, such as radiotherapy, have been completed.others prefer to return to work in between treatments. your mdt will be able to advise you, but the final decision will be yours.it can take several weeks to fully recover from the effects of a mastectomy. a structured exercise programme, where the intensity and amount of time spent exercising is gradually increased, will probably be recommended.your treatment team will be able to provide you with more advice or refer you to a physiotherapist (a specialist with training in rehabilitation using exercise).after surgery, you may experience numbness or tingling at the site of the scar and in your upper arm. this is common, and is caused by nerve damage during surgery.the numbness and tingling should pass within a few weeks or months, although it can occasionally be permanent.another possible complication is painful swelling in the arms. this is calledlymphoedema, which is caused by the disruption of the lymphatic system (a series of channels and lymph nodes normally responsible for removing excess fluid from tissue).if many lymph nodes are surgically removed, it can disrupt the lymphatic system’s ability to drain fluid, which can lead to swelling.there’s no cure for lymphoedema, but it’s possible to control the symptoms using a combination of different techniques, such as massage and compression garments.seetreating lymphoedemafor more informationradiotherapyis a type of treatment involving a machine that releases high-energy waves to destroy cancerous cells. it can be given a few weeks after surgery to prevent the cancerous cells returning.a typical course of radiotherapy involves 2 to 5 sessions a week over the course of 3 to 6 weeks. the sessions are short and usually only last for 10 to 15 minutes.radiotherapy isn’t usually painful, although you’ll probably experience some side effects. this is because the energy released during radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells.common side effects of radiotherapy can include: extreme tiredness (fatigue) feeling sick (nausea) sore, red and irritated skin on the breast similar in appearance tosunburnthe side effects of radiotherapy should pass after your course of treatment has finished, although some men experience prolonged fatigue for several months.radiotherapy can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer and relieve the symptoms of pain. this is known as palliative radiotherapy.palliative radiotherapy is usually given in just 1 or 2 doses and doesn’t usually cause any side effects.up to 90% of cases of breast cancers in men are oestrogen receptor positive, or er+. ‘e’ is used because the american spelling of oestrogen is ‘estrogen’.this means the cancerous cells require oestrogen to grow. oestrogen is a type of hormone found in low levels in men and much higher levels in women.the aim of hormone therapy is to block the effects of oestrogen on the breast tissue to prevent the cancer recurring after surgery. it can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer.tamoxifen is one of the hormone-blocking medications widely used for breast cancer. it’s available in tablet or liquid form, and prevents oestrogen entering the breast tissue cells.the ideal length of treatment with tamoxifen is unclear. studies in women with breast cancer suggest a five-year course of treatment is the most effective for preventing the return of cancer and extending survival rates. however, it’s unclear if this also applies to men.tamoxifen can also cause unpleasant side effects, which will be taken into consideration when your treatment team is deciding which treatments to recommend. you can discuss the pros and cons of long-term treatment with tamoxifen with your doctors.side effects of tamoxifen can include: reduced interest in sex(loss of libido) inability to obtain or maintain an erection(erectile dysfunction) headache feeling sick – taking your medication with food may help reduce this side effect changes in mood, such as feeling irritable ordepressedyou should inform your team if you experience side effects that become particularly troublesome, as alternative medications are available.aromatase inhibitors are an alternative type of hormone medication. they may be used if tamoxifen proves unsuccessful or the side effects of tamoxifen are particularly troublesome. aromatase inhibitors can also be used to slow the spread of advanced breast cancer.in men, oestrogen is created when a protein called aromatase converts another hormone called androgens. aromatase inhibitors block the effects of aromatase, which in turn lowers the amount of oestrogen in the body.aromatase inhibitors are usually given in tablet form and taken daily for two to five years. as with tamoxifen, there’s little available evidence about the most effective length of dosage in men, compared with female breast cancer.side effects of aromatase inhibitors can include: joint pain lack of energy hot flushes skin rashes feeling sick being sick thinning of the hairhowever, it’s unlikely you’ll experience any or all of these side effects.chemotherapyis used to treat cases of breast cancer where hormone therapy would be largely ineffective because the cancerous cells are not oestrogen receptor positive (er+).it’s usually given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning, or it’s used to treat the symptoms of incurable cancer.chemotherapy for breast cancer involves taking a combination of cancer-killing medications. treatment is usually given every 2 to 3  weeks over the course of 6 months.you may be given chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy), chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy), or a combination of both.the side effects of chemotherapy can include: feeling sick being sick diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes infertility hair lossthe side effects should resolve once your treatment has finished. your hair should grow back about 3 to 6 months after treatment.chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. it’s important to tell your mdt about any symptoms of a potential infection, such as: a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or above flu-like symptoms, such as chills or joint pain a general sense of feeling unwellyou should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection.if you’re sexually active, you should use acondomfor 48 hours after receiving a dose of chemotherapy medication. this is because the medication used in chemotherapy could pass into your semen and cause irritation in the tissue of your partner’s genitals.you should avoid having children while receiving chemotherapy as many of the medications can damage your sperm and increase your chances of having a baby with a birth defect. again, using a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, is recommendeddepending on the medications used, it may be several months after your course of chemotherapy has ended before you can safely have children. your mdt will be able to give you a more detailed recommendation.biological therapy uses medication to block the effects of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) in cases where her2 is contributing to breast cancer.biological therapies are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they are designed to target biological processes that cancers rely on to grow and reproduce.if you have high levels of the her2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you’ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. also known by the brand name herceptin, it is usually used after radiotherapy or chemotherapy to prevent cancerous cells returning.trastuzumabis a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. antibodies occur naturally in the body and are created by the immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. the trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells designed to respond to the her2 protein.trastuzumab is given through a drip, directly into a vein (intravenously). you’ll receive the treatment in hospital. each treatment session takes up to 1 hour, and the number of sessions you need depends on whether your breast cancer is in its early or more advanced stages.on average, for early breast cancer you’ll need to have a session once every 3 weeks, and for more advanced cancer you’ll need to have weekly sessions.trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. this means it’s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such asangina, uncontrolledhigh blood pressure(hypertension), or heart valve disease.if you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll need to have regular tests on your heart to ensure it’s not causing any problems.other side effects of trastuzumab can include: an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever diarrhoea tiredness aches and pains breast cancer (female)',\n",
       " 'Bronchiectasis': 'bronchiectasis is a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection.the most common symptoms of bronchiectasis include: a persistentcoughthat usually brings up phlegm (sputum) breathlessnessthe severity of symptoms can vary widely. some people have only a few symptoms that don’t appear often, while others have wide-ranging daily symptoms.the symptoms tend to get worse if you develop an infection in your lungs.read more about thesymptoms of bronchiectasis.you should see your gp if you develop a persistent cough. while this may not be caused by bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation.if your gp suspects you may have bronchiectasis, they’ll refer you to a specialist in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further tests.read more aboutdiagnosing bronchiectasis.the lungs are full of tiny branching airways, known as bronchi. oxygen travels through these airways, ends up in tiny sacs called alveoli, and from there is absorbed into the bloodstream.the inside walls of the bronchi are coated with sticky mucus, which protects against damage from particles moving down into the lungs.in bronchiectasis, one or more of the bronchi are abnormally widened. this means more mucus than usual gathers there, which makes the bronchi more vulnerable to infection. if an infection does develop, the bronchi may be damaged again, so even more mucus gathers in them, and the risk of infection increases further.over time, this cycle can cause gradually worsening damage to the lungs.bronchiectasis can develop if the tissue and muscles that surround the bronchi are damaged or destroyed.there are many reasons why this may happen. the three most common causes in the uk are: a lung infection during childhood, such aspneumoniaorwhooping cough, that damages the bronchi underlying problems with the immune system (the body’s defence against infection) that make the bronchi more vulnerable to damage from an infection allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (abpa) – an allergy to a certain type of fungi that can cause the bronchi to become inflamed if spores from the fungi are inhaledhowever, in many cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause for the condition can be found (known as idiopathic bronchiectasis).read more about thecauses of bronchiectasis.bronchiectasis is thought to be uncommon. it’s estimated that around 1 in every 1,000 adults in the uk have the condition.it can affect

very severe symptoms, however, bronchiectasis can be fatal if the lungs stop working properly.around 1,000 deaths reported in england and wales each year are thought to be caused by bronchiectasis.if you have bronchiectasis, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the national congenital anomaly and rare diseases registration service (ncardrs).this helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. you can opt out of the register at any time.find out more about the register.the most common symptom of bronchiectasis is a persistent cough that brings up a large amount of phlegm on a daily basis.the phlegm can be clear, pale yellow or yellow-greenish in colour. other people may only occasionally cough up small amounts of phlegm, or none at all.other symptoms may include: shortness of breath wheezing coughing up blood or blood-stained phlegm chest pain joint pain clubbing of the fingertips – the tissue beneath the nail thickens and the fingertips become rounded and bulbousif you develop a lung infection, your symptoms usually get worse within a few days. this is known as an infective exacerbation and it can cause: coughing up even more phlegm, which may be more green than usual or smell unpleasant worsening shortness of breathyou may also: feel very tired cough up blood, if you haven’t already done so experience a sharp chest pain that’s made worse when breathing (pleurisy) feel generally unwellif you haven’t previously been diagnosed with bronchiectasis and you develop a persistent cough, visit your gp for advice.while persistent coughing may not necessarily be the result of bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation.if you’ve been previously diagnosed with bronchiectasis and you begin to experience symptoms that suggest you have a lung infection, contact your gp. you’ll usually need treatment with antibiotics.some people with bronchiectasis are given a stock of antibiotics as a precaution, in case they suddenly develop a lung infection.some people with bronchiectasis develop a severe lung infection that may need to be treated in hospital.signs and symptoms of serious lung infection include: a bluish tinge to the skin and lips (cyanosis) confusion a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or above rapid breathing (more than 25 breaths a minute) severe chest pain that makes it too painful to cough and clear your lungsif you experience any of the above, phone the healthcare professional in charge of your care immediately. this may be your gp, a doctor who specialises in lung conditions (pulmonologist) or a specialist nurse.if this isn’t possible, then phone the nhs 24 111 service or your local out-of-hours service.bronchiectasis is caused by the airways of the lungs becoming damaged and widened. this can be due to an infection or another condition. sometimes, the cause is not known.your lungs are continually exposed to germs, so your body has sophisticated defence mechanisms designed to keep the lungs free of infection.if a foreign substance (such as bacteria or a virus) gets past these defences, your immune system will attempt to stop the spread of any infection by sending white blood cells to the location of the infection. these cells release chemicals to fight the infection, which can cause the surrounding tissue to become inflamed.for most people, this inflammation will pass without causing any further problems. however, bronchiectasis can occur if the inflammation permanently destroys the elastic-like tissue and muscles surrounding the bronchi (airways), causing them to widen.the abnormal bronchi then become filled with excess mucus, which can trigger persistent coughing and make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. if the lungs do become infected again, this can result in further inflammation and further widening of the bronchi.as this cycle is repeated, the damage to the lungs gets progressively worse. how quickly bronchiectasis progresses can vary significantly. for some people, the condition will get worse quickly, but for many the progression is slow.in around half of all cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause can be found.some of the more common triggers that have been identified are described below.around a third of cases of bronchiectasis in adults are associated with a severe lung infection in childhood, such as: severepneumonia whooping cough tuberculosis (tb) measleshowever, as there are now vaccinations available for these infections, it is expected that childhood infections will become a less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future.around 1 in 12 cases of bronchiectasis occur because a person has a weakened immune system, which makes their lungs more vulnerable to tissue damage. the medical term for having a weakened immune system is immunodeficiency.some people are born with an immunodeficiency because of problems with the genes they inherit from their parents. it’s also possible to acquire an immunodeficiency after an infection such ashiv.around 1 in 14 people with bronchiectasis develop the condition as a complication of an allergic condition known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (abpa).people with abpa have an allergy to a type of fungi known as aspergillus, which is found in a wide range of different environments across the world.if a person with abpa breathes in fungal spores, it can trigger an allergic reaction and persistent inflammation, which in turn can progress to bronchiectasis.aspiration is the medical term for stomach contents accidentally passing into your lungs, rather than down into your gastrointestinal tract. this is responsible for around 1 in 25 cases of bronchiectasis.the lungs are very sensitive to the presence of foreign objects, such as small samples of food or even stomach acids, so this can trigger inflammation leading to bronchiectasis.cystic fibrosisis a relatively common genetic disorder, where the lungs become clogged up with mucus. the mucus then provides an ideal environment for a bacterial infection to take place, leading to the symptoms of bronchiectasis.it is estimated that cystic fibrosis is responsible for around 1 in 33 cases of bronchiectasis.cilia are the tiny, hair-like structures that line the airways in the lungs. they are designed to protect the airways and help move away any excess mucus. bronchiectasis can develop if there is a problem with the cilia that means they are unable to effectively clear mucus from the airways.conditions that can cause problems with the cilia include: young’s disease – a rare condition only affecting males that is thought to be caused by exposure to mercury in childhood primary ciliary dyskinesia – a rare condition caused by inheriting faulty genesit’s estimated that about 1 in every 33 cases of bronchiectasis are caused by young’s disease and 1 or 2 in every 100 cases are caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia.however, as the regulations regarding the use of mercury are now much stricter than they were in the past, it is expected that young’s syndrome will become a much less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future.certain conditions that cause inflammation in other areas of the body are sometimes associated with bronchiectasis, including: rheumatoid arthritis sjögren’s syndrome crohn’s disease ulcerative colitisthese conditions are usually thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, where it mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.you should see your gp for advice if you develop a persistent cough, so they can look for a possible cause.your gp will ask you about your symptoms, such as how often you cough, whether you bring up any phlegm (sputum) and whether you smoke.they may also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope as you breathe in and out. the lungs of people with bronchiectasis often make a distinctive crackling noise as a person breaths in and out.you’ll also probably have a chestx-rayto rule out other, more serious, causes of your symptoms, such aslung cancer.if your gp thinks you may have a lung infection, they may take a sample of your phlegm, so it can be checked for bacteria.if your gp suspects you could have bronchiectasis, you’ll be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further testing.the maximum time you should have to wait for referral is 18 weeks, although you may not have to wait as long as this.read more about waiting times.some of the tests a respiratory consultant may carry out to help diagnose bronchiectasis are described below.currently, the most effective test available to diagnose bronchiectasis is called a high-resolutioncomputerised tomography(hrct) scan.a hrct scan involves taking several x-rays of your chest at slightly different angles. a computer is then used to put all the images together. this produces a very detailed picture of the inside of your body and the airways inside your lungs (the bronchi) should show up very clearly.in a healthy pair of lungs, the bronchi should become narrower the further they spread into your lungs, in the same way a tree branch separates into narrower branches and twigs.if the scan shows that a section of airways is actually getting wider, this usually confirms bronchiectasis.other tests can be used to assess the state of your lungs and to try to determine what the underlying cause of your bronchiectasis may be.these tests may include: blood tests– to check how well your immune system is working and check for infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi phlegm (sputum) test – to check for bacteria or fungi a sample of your sweat can be tested to see how much salt is in it – high levels of salt can be caused by cystic fibrosis (if this test is positive, then a more detailed genetic test can be carried out; seediagnosing cystic fibrosisfor further information) lung function test – a small, hand-held device (spirometer) that you blow into is used to measure how hard and how quickly you can expel air from your lungs; this can assess how well your lungs are working bronchoscopy – a flexible tube with a camera at one end is used to look into your lungs; this is usually only required if you think you’ve inhaled a foreign objectthe damage to the lungs associated with bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help prevent the condition getting worse.in most cases, treatment involves a combination of medication, exercises you can learn and devices to help clear your airways. surgery for bronchiectasis is rare.there are a number of things you can do to help relieve the symptoms of bronchiectasis and stop the condition getting worse, including: stopping smoking(if you smoke) having the flu vaccine every year making sure you have had thepneumococcal vaccineto protect againstpneumonia exercisingregularly keeping yourself well hydrated eating abalanced dietthere are a range of exercises, known as airway clearance techniques, which can help to remove mucus from your lungs. this can often help improve coughing and breathlessness in people with bronchiectasis.you can be referred to a physiotherpist, who can teach you these techniques.the most widely used technique in the uk is called active cycle of breathing techniques (acbt).acbt involves you repeating a cycle made up of a number of different steps. these include a period of normal breathing, followed by deep breaths to loosen the mucus and force it up; then you cough the mucus out. the cycle is then repeated for 20 to 30 minutes.don’t attempt acbt if you haven’t first been taught the steps by a suitably trained physiotherapist, as performing the techniques incorrectly could damage your lungs.if you’re otherwise in good health, you’ll probably only need to perform acbt once or twice a day. if you develop a lung infection, you may need to perform acbt on a more frequent basis.changing your position can also make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs. this is known as postural drainage.each technique can involve several complex steps, but most techniques involve you leaning or lying down while the physiotherapist or a carer uses their hands to vibrate certain sections of your lungs as you go through a series of “huffing” and coughing.there are also a number of handheld devices that can help to remove mucus from your lungs.although these devices look different, most work in a similar way. generally, they use a combination of vibrations and air pressure to make it easier to cough out any mucus.examples of these devices include the flutter, the rc cornet and the acapella.however, these devices aren’t always available on the nhs, so you may have to pay for one yourself. they usually cost £45 to £60.in some cases, medications to make breathing or clearing your lungs easier may be prescribed. these are discussed below.occasionally, medication inhaled through a device called a nebuliser may be recommended to help make it easier for you to clear your lungs.nebulisers are devices consisting of a face mask or mouthpiece, a chamber to convert the medication into a fine mist, and a compressor to pump the medication into your lungs.a number of different medications can be administered using a nebuliser, including salt water solutions. these medications help to reduce the thickness of your phlegm so it’s easier to cough it out. nebulisers can also be used to administer antibiotics, if necessary (see below).however, while the medications used with a nebuliser can be provided on prescription, the nebuliser device itself isn’t always available on the nhs. in some areas, a local respiratory service may provide the device without charge, but if this isn’t an option, you may have to pay for a device.if you have a particularly severe flare-up of symptoms, you may be prescribed bronchodilator medications on a short-term basis.bronchodilators are inhaled medications that help make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles in the lungs. examples of this type of medication include beta2-adrenergic agonist, anticholinergics and theophylline.if you experience a worsening of symptoms because of a bacterial infection (known as an “infective exacerbation”) then you’ll need to be treated withantibiotics.a sample of phlegm will be taken to determine what type of bacteria is causing the infection, although you’ll be initially treated with an antibiotic known to be effective against a number of different bacteria (a broad spectrum antibiotic) because it can take a few days to get the test results.depending on the test results, you may be prescribed a different antibiotic, or in some cases, a combination of antibiotics known to be effective against the specific bacteria causing the infection.if you’re well enough to be treated at home, you’ll probably be prescribed two to three antibiotic tablets a day for 10-14 days. it’s important to finish the course even if you feel better, as stopping the course prematurely could cause the infection to recur quickly.if your symptoms are more severe (seesymptoms of bronchiectasisfor a detailed description) you may need to be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotic injections.if you have three or more infective exacerbations in any one year, or your symptoms during an infective exacerbation were particularly severe, it may be recommended that you take antibiotics on a long-term basis. this can help to prevent further infections and give your lungs the chance to recover.this could involve taking low-dose antibiotic tablets to minimise the risk of side effects, or using an antibiotic nebuliser (see above for more information about nebulisers).using antibiotics in this way does increase the risk that one or more types of bacteria will develop a resistance to the antibiotic. therefore, you may be asked to give regular phlegm samples to check for any resistance. if bacteria do show signs of developing a resistance, then your antibiotic may need to be changed.surgery is usually only recommended where bronchiectasis is only affecting a single section of your lung, your symptoms aren’t responding to other treatment and you don’t have an underlying condition that could cause bronchiectasis to recur.the lungs are made up of sections known as lobes – the left lung has two lobes and the right lung has three lobes. surgery for focal bronchiectasis would usually involve removing the lobe affected by the bronchiectasis in a type of operation known as a lobectomy.surgery won’t be used if more than one lobe is affected, as it’s too dangerous to remove so much lung tissue.in some cases, people with bronchiectasis can develop serious complications that require emergency treatment.a rare, but serious, complication of bronchiectasis is coughing up large amounts of blood (the medical term for this is massive haemoptysis). this can occur when a section of one of the blood vessels supplying the lungs suddenly splits open.symptoms that may indicate massive haemoptysis include: coughing up more than 100ml of blood in a 24-hour period – 100ml is roughly equivalent to a third of a can of drink breathing difficulties – caused by blood obstructing your airways feeling lightheaded, dizzy and having cold, clammy skin – caused by rapid blood lossmassive haemoptysis is a medical emergency. if you think someone is experiencing massive haemoptysis, then phone 999 for an ambulance.a person with massive haemoptysis needs to be admitted to hospital and a tube may need to be placed into their throat to assist them with their breathing.a procedure called a bronchial artery embolisation (bae), carried out by specialist radiology doctors, will then be required to stop the bleeding. during a bae, a special dye is injected into your arteries so they show up clearly onx-rays.then, using x-ray scans as a guide, the source of the bleeding is located and injected with tiny particles, around the size of a grain of sand, that will help clog the vessel up and stop the bleeding. bronchiectasis cystic fibrosis shortness of breath',\n",

x-ray, and a sample of mucus may be taken for testing.if your gp thinks you might have an undiagnosed underlying condition, they may also suggest a pulmonary function test. you will be asked to take a deep breath and blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures the volume of air in your lungs. decreased lung capacity can indicate an underlying health problem.in most cases, bronchitis will clear up by itself within a few weeks without the need for treatment. this type of bronchitis is known as “acute bronchitis”. while you are waiting for it to pass, you should drink lots of fluid and get plenty of rest.in some cases, the symptoms of bronchitis can last much longer. if symptoms last for at least three months, it is known as “chronic bronchitis”. there is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but there are several medications to help relieve symptoms. it is also important to avoid smoking and smoky environments, as this can make your symptoms worse.read more abouttreating bronchitis.the bronchi are the main airways in your lungs, which branch off on either side of your windpipe (trachea). they lead to smaller and smaller airways inside your lungs, known as bronchioles.the walls of the bronchi produce mucus to trap dust and other particles that could otherwise cause irritation.most cases of acute bronchitis develop when an infection causes the bronchi to become irritated and inflamed, which causes them to produce more mucus than usual. your body tries to shift this extra mucus through coughing.smoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis. over time, tobacco smoke can cause permanent damage to the bronchi, causing them to become inflamed.read more about thecauses of bronchitis.pneumoniais the most common complication of bronchitis. it happens when the infection spreads further into the lungs, causing air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid. 1 in 20 cases of bronchitis leads to pneumonia.people at an increased risk of

develops following acold, sore throat orflu.it is estimated that there are around 2 million people in the uk affected by chronic bronchitis. most of these are adults over the age of 50.the main symptom of bronchitis is a hacking cough. it is likely that your cough will bring up thick yellow-grey mucus (phlegm), although this does not always happen.other symptoms of bronchitis are similar to those of other infections, such as thecommon coldorsinusitis, and may include: sore throat headache runny or blocked nose aches and pains tirednessif you have bronchitis, your cough may last for

can be caused by either a virus or bacteria, although viral bronchitis is much more common.in most cases, bronchitis is caused by the same viruses that cause thecommon coldorflu. the virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone coughs or sneezes.these droplets typically spread about 1m (3ft). they hang suspended in the air for a while, then land on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus further by touching something else.everyday items at home and in public places, such as door handles and keyboards, may have traces of the virus on them. people usually become infected by picking up the virus on their hands from contaminated objects, and then placing their hands near their nose or mouth. it is also possible to breathe in the virus if it is suspended in airborne droplets.bronchitis can also be triggered by breathing in irritant substances, such as smog, chemicals in household products or tobacco smoke.smoking is the main cause of long-term (chronic) bronchitis, and it can affect people who inhale second-hand smoke, as well as smokers themselves.read information abouttreatments to quit smoking.you may also be at risk of bronchitis and other forms ofchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)if you are often exposed to materials

spend a lot of time thinking about food.the main symptoms of bulimia are:when making a diagnosis, your gp will probably ask questions about your eating habits. for example, they could ask: how you feel about your weight if you’re concerned about it if you make yourself vomit regularly if you binge-eatit’s important to answer these questions honestly. your gp isn’t trying to judge you or ‘catch you out’. they just need to accurately assess how serious your symptoms are.your gp may check your weight and calculate your body mass index (bmi).your gp might check your pulse and blood

eating disorder service will usually offer a structured programme of psychological treatment.the main type of psychological treatment for bulimia is cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt). cbt starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. cbt helps to change the harmful behaviour while working on changing how you think about food, eating, and

       " 'Carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumours': 'a carcinoid tumour is a rare cancer of the neuroendocrine system – the body system that produces hormones.the tumour usually grows in the bowels or appendix, but it can also be found in the stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, kidney, ovaries or testicles. it tends to grow very slowly.carcinoid syndrome is the collection of symptoms some people get when a carcinoid tumour – usually one that has spread to the liver – releases hormones such as serotonin into the bloodstream.in the early stages of having a carcinoid tumour, you may not have any symptoms. you may also not have symptoms if the tumour is just in your digestive system, as any hormones it produces will be broken down by your liver.if symptoms do develop, they tend to be fairly general and can be easily mistaken for signs of other illnesses.symptoms may result from both the tumour itself and from any hormones it releases into the bloodstream.symptoms will depend on where in the body the tumour develops:some tumours may not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance. for example, an appendix carcinoid tumour may only be found when the appendix is being removed for another reason.typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include: diarrhoea, tummy pain and loss of appetite flushing of the skin, particularly the face fast heart rate breathlessness and wheezingthese symptoms may come on unexpectedly, as the hormones can be produced by the tumour at any time.some people may also develop carcinoid heart disease, where the heart valves thicken and stop working properly. there is also a risk of developing a rare but serious reaction called a carcinoid crisis, which involves severe flushing, breathlessness and a drop in blood pressure.it’s not known exactly why carcinoid tumours develop, but it’s thought that most occur by chance.your chances of developing a carcinoid tumour may be increased if you have: a rare family syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (men1) parents or siblings with a carcinoid tumour parents withsquamous cell skin cancer,non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, or cancer of the brain, breast, liver, womb, bladder or kidney conditions called neurofibromatosis ortuberous sclerosisa carcinoid tumour may be found incidentally – for example, as a surgeon is removing an appendix. in this case, the tumour will often be caught early and removed along with the appendix, causing no further problems.otherwise, people usually speak to their gp after they have developed symptoms. a carcinoid tumour may be diagnosed after carrying out a series of scans and tests, which may include measuring the amount of serotonin in your urine and having anendoscopy.if the tumour is caught early, it may be possible to completely remove it and cure the cancer altogether. otherwise, surgeons will remove as much of the tumour as possible (debulking).you can read more about the surgery for carcinoid tumours on the cancer research uk website.if the tumour cannot be removed, but it’s not growing or causing symptoms, you may not need treatment straight away – it might just be carefully monitored.if it’s causing symptoms, you may be offered one of the following treatments: injections of medicines called somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide and lanreotide, which can slow down the growth of the tumour radiotherapyto kill some of the cancer cells a procedure to block the blood supply to the tumour (for tumours in the liver), known as hepatic artery embolisation a procedure that uses a heated probe to kill cancer cells (for tumours in the liver), called radiofrequency ablation chemotherapyto shrink the tumour and control your symptomssymptoms of carcinoid syndrome can be treated with injections of octreotide and lanreotide. you may also be given medication to widen your airways (to relieve wheezing and breathlessness) and anti-diarrhoea medication.there are things you can do yourself to manage some of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.generally, you should avoid triggers of flushing, such as: alcohol large meals spicy foods foods containing the substance tyramine, such as aged cheese and salted or pickled meats stresssome medications, such asselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) antidepressants, may make symptoms worse by further increasing your levels of serotonin – but never stop taking medication without seeking medical advice.if you have diarrhoea, it’s important to keep drinking little and often to avoiddehydration.if the whole tumour can be removed, this may cure the cancer and symptoms altogether. but even if surgeons cannot remove the entire tumour, it usually grows slowly and can be controlled with medication.overall, people with carcinoid tumours have a good life expectancy compared to many other cancers. many people remain relatively well and lead active lives, with only occasional symptoms.but as the tumour grows or spreads, it will produce more and more hormones, and it may eventually be difficult to completely control symptoms with medication. you may need further surgery or other treatments.unfortunately, life expectancy is not as good for cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, because it won’t usually be possible to remove all of it. however, treatment can still control your symptoms and slow down the spread of cancer.if you have carcinoid syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the national congenital anomaly and rare diseases registration service (ncardrs).this helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. you can opt out of the register at any time.find out more about the register neuroendocrine tumours cancer research uk: carcinoid syndrome cancer

sexual contact with a man or a woman.there are more than 100 different types of hpv, many of which are harmless. however, some types of hpv can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix, which can eventually lead to cervical cancer.two strains of the hpv virus (hpv 16 and hpv 18) are known to be responsible for 70% of all cases of cervical cancer. these types of hpv infection don’t have any symptoms, so many women won’t realise they have the infection.however, it’s important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who have them don’t develop cervical cancer.usingcondomsduring sex offers some protection against hpv, but it can’t always prevent infection, because the virus is also spread through skin-to-skin contact of the wider genital area.since

sexually active women aged between 30 and 45. cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25.the symptoms of cervical cancer aren’t always obvious, and it may not cause any symptoms at all until it’s reached an advanced stage.this is why it’s very important that you attend all of yourcervical screeningappointments.in most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. it usually occurs after having sex.bleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthlyperiodis also considered unusual. this includes bleeding after themenopause(when a woman’s monthly periods stop).visit your gp for advice if you experience any type of unusual vaginal bleeding.other symptoms of cervical cancer may include pain and discomfort during sex and an unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge.if the cancer spreads out of your cervix and into surrounding tissue and organs, it can trigger a range of other symptoms, including: constipation blood in your urine (haematuria) loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence) bone pain swelling of one of your legs severe pain in your side or back caused by swelling in your kidneys, related to a condition called hydronephrosis

outside of your normal periods new bleeding after the menopausevaginal bleeding is very common and can have a wide range of causes, so it doesn’t necessarily mean you have cervical cancer. however, unusual vaginal bleeding is a symptom that needs to be investigated by your gp.in almost all cases, cervical cancer is the result of a change in cell dna caused by the human papilloma virus (hpv).cancer begins with a change in the structure of the dna that’s present in all human cells. dna provides the cells with a basic set of instructions, including when to grow and reproduce.a change in the dna’s structure is known as a mutation. it can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means the cells continue growing instead of stopping when they should. if the cells reproduce uncontrollably, they produce a lump of tissue called a tumour.more than 99% of cervical cancer cases occur in women who have been previously infected with hpv. hpv is a group of viruses, rather than a single virus. there are more than 100 different types.hpv is spread during sexual intercourse and other types of sexual activity (such as skin-to-skin contact of the genital areas, or using sex toys) and is thought to be very common. it’s estimated that 1 in 3 women will develop an hpv infection within 2 years of starting to have regular sex, and about 4 in 5 women will develop the infection at some point in their lives.some types of hpv don’t cause any noticeable symptoms and the infection will pass without treatment. other types of hpv can causegenital warts, although these types aren’t linked to an increased risk of causing cervical cancer.about 15 types of hpv are considered high-risk for cervical cancer. the 2 types known to have the highest risk are hpv 16 and hpv 18, which cause about 7 out of every 10 cervical cancers.high-risk types of hpv are thought to contain genetic material that can be passed into the cells of the cervix. this material begins to disrupt the normal workings of the cells, which can eventually cause them to reproduce uncontrollably, leading to the growth of a cancerous tumour.as most types of hpv don’t cause any symptoms, you or your partner could have the virus for months or years without knowing it.seepreventing cervical cancerfor more information about reducing your chances of developing an hpv infection.cancer of the cervix usually takes many years to develop. before it does, the cells in the cervix often show changes known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) or, less commonly, cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (cgin).cin and cgin are pre-cancerous conditions. pre-cancerous conditions don’t pose an immediate threat to a person’s health, but they can potentially develop into cancer in the future.however, even if you develop cin or cgin, the chances of it developing into cervical cancer are very small, and if the changes are discovered duringcervical screening, treatment is highly successful.the progression from becoming infected with hpv to developing cin or cgin and then developing cervical cancer is very slow, often taking 10 to 20 years.read more aboutcervical screening resultsthe fact that hpv infection is very common but cervical cancer is relatively uncommon suggests that only a very small proportion of women are vulnerable to the effects of an hpv infection. there appear to be additional risk factors that affect a woman’s chance of developing cervical cancer. these include: smoking – women who smoke are twice as likely to develop cervical cancer than women who don’t; this may be caused by the harmful effects of chemicals found in tobacco on the cells of the cervix having a weakened immune system – this can occur as a result of taking certain medications, such as immunosuppressants, which are used to stop the body rejecting donated organs, or as a result of a condition such ashiv or aids taking theoral contraceptive pillfor more than 5 years – women who take the pill are thought to have twice the risk of developing cervical cancer than those who don’t, although it’s not clear why having children (the more children you have, the greater your risk) – women who have 2 children have twice the risk of getting cervical cancer compared with women who don’t have any childrenthe reason for the link between cervical cancer and childbirth is unclear. one theory is that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may make the cervix more vulnerable to the effects of hpv.if cervical cancer is undiagnosed and untreated, it will slowly spread out of the cervix and into the surrounding tissue and organs. the cancer can spread down to the vagina and the surrounding muscles that support the bones of the pelvis. alternatively, it can spread upwards, blocking the tube that runs from your kidneys to your bladder (ureters).the cancer can then spread into your bladder, rectum (back passage) and eventually into your liver, bones and lungs. cancerous cells can also spread through your lymphatic system. the lymphatic system is a series of nodes (glands) and channels spread throughout your body in a similar way to the blood circulation system.the lymph nodes produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness). if you have an infection, the nodes in your neck or under your armpits can become swollen.in some cases of early cervical cancer, the lymph nodes close to the cervix contain cancerous cells. in some cases of advanced cervical cancer, lymph nodes in the chest and abdomen can be affected.if cervical cancer is suspected, you’ll be referred to a gynaecologist (a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system).referral will be recommended if the results of yourcervical screening testsuggest that there are abnormalities in the cells of your cervix. however, in most cases, the abnormalities don’t mean you have cervical cancer.you may also be referred to a gynaecologist if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, or if your gp has noticed a growth inside your cervix during an examination.the sexually transmitted infection (sti)chlamydiais one of the most common reasons why women experience unusual vaginal bleeding. your gp may recommend that you’re tested for it first before being referred.testing for chlamydiainvolves taking a small tissue sample from your cervix, or carrying out a urine test.if you’ve had an abnormal cervical screening test result, or your symptoms suggest that you may have cervical cancer, your gynaecologist will usually carry out acolposcopy. this is an examination to look for abnormalities in your cervix.during a colposcopy, a small microscope with a light source at the end (colposcope) is used. as well as examining your cervix, your gynaecologist may remove a small tissue sample (biopsy) so that it can be checked under a microscope for cancerous cells.in some cases, a minor operation called a cone biopsy may also be carried out. the operation is carried out in hospital, usually under alocal anaesthetic.during a cone biopsy, a small, cone-shaped section of your cervix will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells. you may experience vaginal bleeding for up to four weeks after the procedure. you may also have period-like pains.if the results of the biopsy suggest you have cervical cancer and there’s a risk that the cancer may have spread, you’ll probably need to have some further tests to assess how widespread the cancer is. these tests may include: a pelvic examination carried out undergeneral anaesthetic– your womb, vagina, rectum and bladder will be checked for cancer blood tests– these can be used to help assess the state of your liver, kidneys and bone marrow computerised tomography (ct) scan– scans are taken of the inside of your body and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed three-dimensional image; the ct scan can help to identify cancerous tumours and show whether cancerous cells have spread magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– this type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the inside of your body; it can also be used to check whether cancer has spread chestx-ray– this will indicate whether cancer has spread to your lungs positive emission tomography (pet) scan– a specialised scan, where a mildly radioactive substance is injected into your veins so the cancerous tissue shows up more clearly; it’s often combined with a ct scan and is used to see if the cancer has spread, or to check how well a person is responding to treatmentafter all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell you what stage cancer you have. staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. the higher the stage, the further the cancer has spread. the staging for cervical cancer is as follows: stage 0 (pre-cancer) – there are no cancerous cells in the cervix, but there are biological changes that could trigger cancer in the future; this is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) or carcinoma in situ (cis) stage 1 – the cancer is still contained inside the cervix stage 2 – the cancer has spread outside of the cervix into the surrounding tissue, but hasn’t reached the tissues lining the pelvis (pelvic wall) or the lower part of the vagina stage 3 – the cancer has spread into the lower section of the vagina and/or into the pelvic wall stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the bowel, bladder or other organs, such as the lungstreatment for cervical cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread.as cancer treatments are often complex, hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (mdts) to treat cervical cancer and tailor the treatment programme to the individual.mdts are made up of a number of different specialists who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.your cancer team will recommend what they think the best treatment options are, but the final decision will be yours. in most cases, the recommendations will be: early cervical cancer – surgery to remove some or all of the womb,radiotherapy, or a combination advanced cervical cancer – radiotherapy and/orchemotherapy, although surgery is also sometimes usedthe prospect of a complete cure is good for cervical cancer diagnosed at an early stage, although the chances of a complete cure decrease the further the cancer has spread.in cases where cervical cancer isn’t curable, it’s often possible to slow its progression, prolong lifespan and relieve any associated symptoms, such as pain and vaginal bleeding. this is known aspalliative care.if your screening results show that you don’t have cervical cancer, but there are biological changes that could turn cancerous in the future, a number of treatment options are available. these include: large loop excision of the transformation zone (lletz) – the abnormal cells are cut away using a fine wire and an electrical current cone biopsy – the area of abnormal tissue is removed during surgery laser therapy – a laser is used to burn away the abnormal cellsread more abouttreating abnormal cells in the cervixthere are 3 main types of surgery for cervical cancer. they are: radical trachelectomy – the cervix, surrounding tissue and the upper part of the vagina are removed, but the womb is left in place hysterectomy – the cervix and womb are removed; depending on the stage of the cancer, it may also be necessary to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes pelvic exenteration – a major operation in which the cervix, vagina, womb, bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectum are removeda radical trachelectomy is usually only suitable if cervical cancer is diagnosed at a very early stage. it’s usually offered to women who want to preserve their child-bearing potential.during the procedure, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions (cuts) in your abdomen. specially designed instruments will be passed through the incisions and used to remove your cervix and the upper section of your vagina. lymph nodes from your pelvis may also be removed. your womb will then be reattached to the lower section of your vagina.compared with a hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration, the advantage of this type of surgery is that your womb remains intact, which means that you may still be able to have children. however, it’s important to be aware that the surgeons carrying out this operation can’t guarantee you’ll still be able to have children.if you do have children after the operation, your child would have to be delivered by caesarean section. it’s also usually recommended that you wait 6 to 12 months after having surgery before trying for a baby, so that your womb and vagina have time to heal.radical trachelectomy is a highly skilled procedure. it’s only available at a number of specialist centres in the uk, so it may not be available in your area and you may have to travel to another city to be treated.ahysterectomyis usually recommended for early cervical cancer. this may be followed by a course of radiotherapy to help prevent the cancer coming back.there are 2 types of hysterectomies used to treat cervical cancer: simple hysterectomy – where the cervix and womb are removed and, in some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are also removed; this is only appropriate for very early stage cervical cancers radical hysterectomy – where the cervix, womb, surrounding tissue and lymph nodes, ovaries and fallopian tubes are all removed; this is the preferred option in advanced stage 1 and some early stage 2 cervical cancersshort-term complications of a hysterectomy include infection, bleeding, blood clots and accidental injury to your ureter, bladder or rectum.the risk of long-term complications is small, but they can be troublesome. they include: the risk that your vagina can become shortened and drier, which can make sex painful urinary incontinence swelling of your arms and legs, caused by a build-up of fluid (lymphoedema) your bowel becomes obstructed because of a build-up of scar tissue – this may require further surgery to correctas your womb is removed during a hysterectomy, you’ll no longer be able to have children.if your ovaries are removed, it will also trigger themenopauseif you haven’t already experienced it. seecomplications of cervical cancerfor more information about the menopause.a pelvic exenteration is a major operation that’s usually only recommended when cervical cancer returns after what was thought to be a previously successful course of treatment. it’s offered if the cancer returns to the pelvis, but hasn’t spread beyond this area.a pelvic exenteration involves two phases of treatment: the cancer is removed, plus your bladder, rectum, vagina and the lower section of your bowel 2 holes called stomas are created in your abdomen – the holes are used to pass urine and faeces out of your body into collection pouches called colostomy bagsfollowing a pelvic exenteration, your vagina can be reconstructed using skin and tissue taken from other parts of your body. this means you’ll be able to have sex after the procedure, although it may be several months until you feel well enough to do so.radiotherapymay be used on its own or combined with surgery for early-stage cervical cancer. it may be combined with chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer, where it can be used to control bleeding and pain.there are 2 ways that radiotherapy can be delivered. these are: externally – a machine beams high-energy waves into your pelvis to destroy cancerous cells internally – a radioactive implant is placed inside your vagina and cervixin most cases, a combination of internal and external radiotherapy will be used. a course of radiotherapy usually lasts for around 5 to 8 weeks.as well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can sometimes also harm healthy tissue. this means it can cause significant side effects many months, and even years, after treatment.however, the benefits of radiotherapy often tend to outweigh the risks. for some people, radiotherapy offers the only hope of getting rid of the cancer.side effects of radiotherapyare common and can include: diarrhoea pain when urinating bleeding from your vagina or rectum feeling very tired (fatigue) feeling sick (nausea) sore skin in your pelvis region similar to sunburn narrowing of your vagina, which can make having sex painful infertility damage to the ovaries, which will usually trigger an early menopause (if you haven’t already experienced it) bladder and bowel damage, which could lead to incontinencemost of these side effects will resolve within about eight weeks of finishing treatment, although in some cases they can be permanent. it’s also possible to develop side effects several months, or even years after treatment has finished.if infertility is a concern for you, it may be possible to surgically remove eggs from your ovaries before you have radiotherapy, so that they can be implanted in your womb at a later date. however, you may have to pay for this.it may also be possible to prevent early menopause by surgically removing your ovaries and replanting them outside the area of your pelvis that will be affected by radiation. this is known as an ovarian transposition.your mdt can provide more information about the possible options for treating infertility and whether you’re suitable for an ovarian transposition.chemotherapycan be combined with radiotherapy to try to cure cervical cancer, or it can be used as a sole treatment for advanced cancer to slow its progression and relieve symptoms (palliative chemotherapy).chemotherapy involves using either a single chemotherapy medication called cisplatin or a combination of different chemotherapy medications to kill the cancerous cells.chemotherapy is usually given using an intravenous drip on an outpatient basis, so you’ll be able to go home once you’ve received your dose.as with radiotherapy, these medications can also damage healthy tissue. side effects are therefore common and can include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea feeling tired all the time reduced production of blood cells, which can make you feel tired and breathless (anaemia) and vulnerable to infection because of a lack of white blood cells mouth ulcers loss of appetite hair loss– your hair should grow back within three to six months of your course of chemotherapy being completed, although not all chemotherapy medications cause hair losssome types of chemotherapy medication can damage your kidneys, so you may need to have regularblood teststo assess the health of your kidneys.after your treatment has been completed and the cancer has been removed, you’ll need to attend regular appointments for testing. this will usually involve a physical examination of your vagina and cervix (if it hasn’t been removed).as there’s a risk of cervical cancer returning, these examinations will be used to look for signs of this. if anything suspicious is found, a further biopsy can be carried out.if cervical cancer does return, it usually returns around 18 months after a course of treatment has been completed.follow-up appointments are usually recommended every four months after treatment has been completed for the first 2 years, and then every 6 to 12 months for a further 3 years.complications of cervical cancer can occur as a side effect of treatment or as the result of advanced cervical cancer.if your ovaries are surgically removed or they’re damaged during treatment withradiotherapy, it will trigger anearly menopause(if you haven’t already had it). most women experience the menopause in their early fifties.the menopause is caused when your ovaries stop producing the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. this leads to the following symptoms: you no longer have monthly periods or your periods become much more irregular hot flushes vaginal dryness loss of sex drive mood changes stress incontinence(leaking urine when you cough or sneeze) night sweats thinning of the bones, which can lead to brittle bones (osteoporosis)these symptoms can be relieved by taking a number of medications that stimulate the production of oestrogen and progesterone. this treatment is known ashormone replacement therapy (hrt).radiotherapy to treat cervical cancer can often cause your vagina to become narrower, which can make having sex painful or difficult.there are 2 main treatment options if you have a narrowed vagina. the first is to apply hormonal cream to your vagina. this should increase moisture within your vagina and make having sex easier.the second is to use a vaginal dilator, which is a tampon-shaped device made of plastic. you insert it into your vagina and is designed to help make it more supple. it’s usually recommended that you insert the dilator for 5 to 10 minutes at a time on a regular basis during the day over the course of 6 to 12 months.many women find discussing the use of a vaginal dilator embarrassing, but it’s a standard and well-recognised treatment for narrowing of the vagina. your specialist cancer nurse or radiographers in the radiotherapy department should be able to give you more information and advice.you may find that the more times you have sex, the less painful it becomes. however, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner.themacmillan cancer supportwebsite has more information aboutsexuality and cancerif the lymph nodes in your pelvis are removed, it can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of your lymphatic system.one of the functions of the lymphatic system is to drain away excess fluid from the body’s tissue. a disruption to this process can lead to a build-up of fluid in the tissue known aslymphoedema. this can cause certain body parts to become swollen – usually the legs, in cases of cervical cancer.there are exercises and massage techniques that can reduce the swelling. wearing specially designed bandages and compression garments can also help.read more abouttreating lymphoedemathe emotional impact of living with cervical cancer can be significant. many people report experiencing a ‘rollercoaster’ effect.for example, you may feel down when you receive a diagnosis, but feel better when removal of the cancer has been confirmed. you may then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of your treatment.this type of emotional disruption can sometimes triggerdepression. typical signs of depression include feeling sad, hopeless and losing interest in things you used to enjoy.contact your gp if you think you may be depressed. there is a range of effective treatments available, includingantidepressant medicationand talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt).you may also findjo’s cervical cancer trusta useful resource. it’s the uk’s only charity dedicated to women affected by cervical cancer.local cancer support groups may also be available in your area for women affected by cancer. your specialist cancer nurse should be able to provide contact details.read more about feelings and cancersome of the complications that can occur in advanced cervical cancer are discussed below.if the cancer spreads into your nerve endings, bones or muscles, it can often cause severe pain.a number of effective painkilling medications can usually be used to control the pain. depending on the levels of pain, they can range fromparacetamolandnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)such asibuprofen, to more powerful opiate-based painkillers, such as codeine and morphine.tell your care team if the painkillers you’re prescribed aren’t effective in reducing your pain. you may need to be prescribed a stronger medication. a short course of radiotherapy may also be effective in controlling the pain.macmillan nurses, who work both in hospitals and in the community, can also provide expert advice about pain relief.your kidneys remove waste material from your blood. the waste is passed out of your body in urine through tubes called the ureters. kidney function can be monitored by a simple blood test called serum creatinine level.in some cases of advanced cervical cancer, the cancerous tumour can press against the ureters, blocking the flow of urine out of the kidneys. the build-up of urine inside the kidneys is known as hydronephrosis and can cause the kidneys to become swollen and stretched.severe cases of hydronephrosis can cause the kidneys to become scarred, which can lead to the loss of most or all of the kidneys’ functions. this is known as kidney failure.kidney failure can cause a wide range of symptoms, including: tiredness swollen ankles, feet or hands, caused by water retention shortness of breath feeling sick blood in your urine (haematuria)treatment options for kidney failure associated with cervical cancer include draining urine out of the kidneys using a tube inserted through the skin and into each kidney (percutaneous nephrostomy). another option is to widen the ureters by placing a small metal tube called a stent inside them.as with other types of cancer, cervical cancer can make the blood ‘stickier’ and more prone to forming clots. bed rest after surgery andchemotherapycan also increase the risk of developing a clot.large tumours can press on the veins in the pelvis, which slows the flow of blood and can lead to a blood clot developing in the legs.symptoms of a blood clot in your legs include: pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf) a heavy ache in the affected area warm skin in the area of the clot redness of the skin, particularly at the back of your leg, below the kneea major concern in these cases is that the blood clot from the leg vein will travel up to the lungs and block the supply of blood. this is known as a pulmonary embolism and can be fatal.blood clots in the legs are usually treated using a combination of blood-thinning medication, such as heparin orwarfarin, and compression garments designed to help encourage the flow of blood through the limbs.read more abouttreating deep vein thrombosisif the cancer spreads into your vagina, bowel or bladder, it can cause significant damage, resulting in bleeding. bleeding can occur in your vagina or rectum (back passage), or you may pass blood when you urinate.minor bleeding can often be treated using a medication called tranexamic acid, which encourages the blood to clot and stop the bleeding. radiotherapy can also be highly effective in controlling bleeding caused by cancer.major bleeding may be treated temporarily by vaginal packing (using gauze to stem the bleeding) and later by surgery, radiotherapy or by cutting off blood supply to the cervix.a fistula is an uncommon but distressing complication that occurs in around 1 in 50 cases of advanced cervical cancer.a fistula is an abnormal channel that develops between 2 sections of the body. in most cases involving cervical cancer, the fistula develops between the bladder and the vagina. this can lead to a persistent discharge of fluid from the vagina. a fistula can sometimes develop between the vagina and rectum.surgery is usually required to repair a fistula, although it’s often not possible in women with advanced cervical cancer, because they’re usually too frail to withstand the effects of surgery.in such cases, treatment often involves using medication, creams and lotions to reduce the amount of discharge and protect the vagina and surrounding tissue from damage and irritation.another uncommon, but distressing, complication of advanced cervical cancer is an unpleasant-smelling discharge from your vagina.the discharge can occur for a number of reasons, such as the breakdown of tissue, the leakage of bladder or bowel contents out of the vagina, or a bacterial infection of the vagina.treatment options for vaginal discharge include an antibacterial gel called metronidazole and wearing clothing that contains charcoal. charcoal is a chemical compound that’s very effective in absorbing unpleasant smells.if your doctors can’t do any more to treat your cancer, your care will focus on controlling your symptoms and helping you to be as comfortable as possible. this is calledpalliative care.palliative care also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers.there are different options for terminal care in the late stages of cancer. you may want to think about whether you’d like to be cared for in hospital, in a hospice or at home, and discuss these issues with your doctor. some organisations who provide care for people with cancer include: macmillan cancer support– which has specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. to be referred to a macmillan nurse, ask your hospital doctor or gp, or call 0808 808 00 00. marie curie

to find a hospice.the impact of cervical cancer on your daily life will depend on the stage of cancer and the treatment you’re having.many women with cervical cancer have a radicalhysterectomy. this is a major operation that takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from. during this time, you need to avoid strenuous tasks and lifting, such as lifting children or heavy shopping bags.you won’t be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks after the operation. most women will also need 8 to 12 weeks off work to recover after having a radical hysterectomy.some of the treatments for cervical cancer can make you very tired, particularlychemotherapyandradiotherapy. because of this, you may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while.don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it. practical help may also be available from your local authority. ask your doctor or nurse about who to contact.having cervical cancer doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to give up work, although you may need quite a lot of time off. during treatment, you may not be able to carry on as you did before.if you have cancer, you’re covered by thedisability discrimination act. this means that your employer isn’t allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. they have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help you cope. examples of these include: allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform, or your working environmentthe definition of what’s ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation, such as how much it would affect your employer’s business, for example.you should give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you’ll need off and when. speak to a member of your human resources department, if you have one. your union or staff association representative can also give you advice.if you’re having difficulties with your employer, your union or localcitizens advice bureaumay be able to help.macmillan cancer supportalso has more information and advice aboutwork and cancer.if you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. if you have cancer or you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. for example: if you have a job but can’t work because of your illness, you’re entitled tostatutory sick payfrom your employer if you don’t have a job and can’t work because of your illness, you may be entitled toemployment and support allowance if you’re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled tocarer’s allowance you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household incomeit’s a good idea to find out what help is available as soon as possible. you could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need.many women feel nervous about having sex soon after treatment for cervical cancer, but it’s perfectly safe. sex won’t make the cancer come back and your partner can’t catch cancer from you.if you want to, you can resume your normal sex life within a few weeks of finishing radiotherapy or having surgery. this will give your body time to heal.if you’re having chemotherapy, male partners should wear acondomwhen you have sex, because it’s not clear if having sex after chemotherapy can have an effect on them.some women find sex difficult after being treated for cervical cancer, because the side effects of some treatments can include vaginal dryness and narrowing of the vagina. in these cases, there are treatments that can help, such as vaginal dilators.seecomplications of cervical cancerfor more informationthere’s no single way to completely prevent cervical cancer, but there are things that can reduce your risk.most cases of cervical cancer are linked to an infection with certain types ofhuman papillomavirus (hpv). hpv can be spread through unprotected sex, so using acondomcan reduce your risk of developing the infection. however, the virus isn’t just passed on through penetrative sex – it can be transmitted during other types of sexual contact, such as skin-to-skin contact between genital areas and by using sex toys.your risk of developing an hpv infection increases the earlier you start having regular sex and with the more sexual partners you have, although women who have only had 1 sexual partner can also develop it.read more aboutsexual healthregularcervical screeningis the best way to identify abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix at an early stage.cervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in scotland between the ages of 25 and 64 every 5 years.you may be recalled more often depending on your test results.make sure that your gp surgery has your up-to-date contact details, so that you continue getting screening invitations.it’s important that you attend your cervical screening tests, even if you’ve been vaccinated for hpv, because the vaccine doesn’t guarantee protection against cervical cancer.if you’ve been treated for abnormal cervical cell changes, you’ll be invited for screening more frequently for several years after treatment. how regularly you need to go will depend on how severe the cell change is.although it can identify most abnormal cell changes in the cervix, cervical screening isn’t always 100% accurate. therefore, you should report symptoms such as unusual vaginal bleeding to your gp, even if you’ve recently been tested.the nhs cervical cancer vaccination programme uses a vaccine called gardasil. gardasil protects against four types of hpv, including the 2 strains responsible for more than 70% of cervical cancers in the uk (hpv16 and hpv 18). it also preventsgenital warts.girls are offered thechildhood immunisation programme. the vaccine is given to girls when they’re 12 to 13 years old, with 3 doses given over a 6-month period.although thehpv vaccinecan significantly reduce the risk of cervical cancer, it doesn’t guarantee that you won’t develop the condition. you should still attend cervical screening tests, even if you’ve had the vaccine.you can reduce your chances of getting cervical cancer by not smoking. people who smoke are less able to get rid of the hpv infection from the

muscle pain.a chest infection is an infection of the lungs or airways. the main types of chest infection arebronchitisandpneumonia.most bronchitis cases are caused by viruses, whereas most pneumonia cases are due to bacteria.these infections are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. this launches tiny droplets of fluid containing the virus or bacteria into the air, where they can be breathed in by others.the infections can also be spread to others if you cough or sneeze onto your hand, an object or a surface, and someone else shakes your hand or touches those surfaces before touching their mouth or nose.certain groups of people have a higher risk of developing serious chest infections, such as: babies and very young children children with developmental problems

wet nappies, drowsiness and cold hands and feet blisters on their skin become infected any of your or your child’s symptoms suddenly get worseoryou have been in contact with someone who has chickenpox, or you have chickenpox symptoms and: you are pregnant or have given birth in the last 7 days you have a weakened immune system (the body’s defence system) your baby is less than 4 weeks old you are breastfeedingif your gp is closed, phone 111. you’re not sure if you or your child has chickenpox you’re worried about your childtell the receptionist you think it might be chickenpox before going in to a gp practice.there is no treatment for chickenpox. but, you can get remedies from your pharmacy that can help symptoms. these include: paracetamolto help bring down a fever calamine lotion and cooling gels to ease itching.in most children, the blisters crust up and fall off naturally within 1 to 2 weeks.adults with chickenpox may be helped by taking antiviral medicine if its diagnosed early enough.you should keep children off school or nursery until all their spots have crusted over. this will help stop chickenpox being spread.adults with chickenpox should stay off work until all the spots have crusted over.chickenpox is infectious from 1 to 2 days before the rash starts. it stops being infectious when all the blisters have crusted over. this happens usually 5 to 6 days after the start of the rash.if you or your child has chickenpox, try to keep them away from public areas. this will help them avoid contact with people who may not have had it.you should especially stay away from people who are at risk of serious problems, such as: newborn babies pregnant women anyone with a weakened immune system, (for example people having cancer treatment or taking steroid tablets)some children and adults are at special risk of serious problems if they catch chickenpox. they include: pregnant women newborn babies people with a weakened immune systemthese people should speak to their gp as soon as they are exposed to the chickenpox virus or they develop chickenpox symptoms.they may need ablood testto check if they are protected from (immune to) chickenpox.if you’re pregnant, chickenpox can occasionally cause complications.chickenpox occurs in approximately 3 in every 1,000 pregnancies.your risk of developingpneumoniais slightly higher if you’re pregnant, especially if you smoke. the further you are into your pregnancy, the more serious the risk of pneumonia tends to be.if you get chickenpox while you’re pregnant, there is also a small but significant risk to your unborn baby.if you get chickenpox during the first 28 weeks of your pregnancy, there is a risk that your unborn baby could develop a condition known as foetal varicella syndrome (fvs).this syndrome is rare.fvs can cause serious complications, including: scarring eye defects, such as cataracts shortened limbs brain damagethere are also other risks from catching chickenpox after week 20 of pregnancy.it’s possible that your baby may be born prematurely (before week 37 of the pregnancy).if you are infected with chickenpox 7 days before or 7 days after giving birth, your newborn baby may develop a more serious type of chickenpox. in a few severe cases, this type of chickenpox can be fatal.once you have had chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection and become immune to catching it again.but, the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, stays inactive in your body’s nerve tissues. this can come back later in life as an illness called shingles.it’s possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but not the other way around.read more aboutshingles.there is a chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule.only children and adults who are more vulnerable to the complications of chickenpox will get offered the vaccine.it may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination. there is also a chance that someone who has had the vaccine could develop chickenpox after coming into close contact with a person who has shingles. self-help guide: rash skin rashes in

       " 'Chilblains': 'chilblains are small, itchy swellings on the skin that occur as a reaction to cold temperatures.they most often affect the body’s extremities, such as the toes, fingers, heels, ears and nose.chilblains can be uncomfortable, but rarely cause any permanent damage. they normally heal within a few weeks if further exposure to the cold is avoided.chilblains usually develop several hours after exposure to the cold. they typically cause a burning and itching sensation in the affected areas, which can become more intense if you go into a warm room.the affected skin may also swell and turn red or dark blue.in severe cases, the surface of the skin may break and sores orblisterscan develop.it’s important not to scratch the skin as it can break easily and become infected.most people don’t need to seek medical advice if they have chilblains as they usually heal within a few weeks and don’t cause any permanent problems.you should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may have become infected.signs of infection include: swelling and pus forming in the affected area feeling generally unwell a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above swollen glandschilblains are the result of an abnormal reaction to the cold. they’re common in the uk because damp, cold weather is usual in the winter.some people develop chilblains that last for several months every winter.when the skin is cold, blood vessels near its surface get narrower. if the skin is then exposed to heat, the blood vessels become wider.if this happens too quickly, blood vessels near the surface of the skin can’t always handle the increased blood flow.this can cause blood to leak into the surrounding tissue, which may cause the swelling and itchiness associated with chilblains.some people are more at risk of chilblains than others.this includes people with: poor circulation a family history of chilblains regular exposure to cold, damp or draughty conditions a poor diet or low body weight lupus– a long-term condition that causes swelling in the body’s tissues raynaud’s phenomenon – a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body, usually the fingers and toespeople who smoke are more at risk of chilblains as nicotine constricts blood vessels.chilblains can also occur on areas of the feet exposed to pressure, such as abunionor a toe that’s squeezed by tight shoes.chilblains often get better on their own after a week or two without treatment.it may help to use a soothing lotion, such as calamine or witch hazel, to relieve itching. your pharmacist may also be able to recommend a suitable product.if your chilblains are severe and keep returning, speak to your gp. they may recommend taking a daily tablet or capsule of a medication called nifedipine. this works by relaxing the blood vessels, improving your circulation.nifedipine can be used to help existing chilblains heal, or can be taken during the winter to stop them developing.if you’re susceptible to chilblains, you can reduce your risk of developing them by: limiting your exposure to the cold looking after your feet taking steps to improve your circulationif your skin gets cold, it’s important to warm it up gradually. heating the skin too quickly – for example, by placing your feet in hot water or near a heater – is one of the main causes of chilblains. stop smoking – nicotine causes the blood vessels to constrict, which can make chilblains worse keep active – this helps improve your circulation wear warm clothes and insulate your hands, feet and legs – wearing long johns, long boots, tights, leg warmers or long socks will help, and it’s a good idea to wear a clean pair of socks if you get cold feet in bed avoid tight shoes and boots – these can restrict the circulation to your toes and feet moisturise your feet regularly – this stops them drying out and the skin cracking eat at least one hot meal during the day – this’ll help warm your whole body, particularly in cold weather warm your shoes on the radiator before you put them on – make sure damp shoes are dry before you wear them; if your feet are already cold, make sure your shoes aren’t too hot to avoid causing chilblains warm your hands before going outdoors – soak them in warm water for several minutes and dry thoroughly, and wear cotton-lined waterproof gloves if necessary; if your hands are already cold, make sure not to warm them up too quickly to avoid causing chilblains keep your house well heated – try to keep one room in the house warm and avoid drafts if you’re diabetic, regularly check your feet (or ask someone else to do this) – people with diabetes may not be able to feel their feet and could have infected chilblains without realising itif you have severe or recurring chilblains, there’s a small risk of further problems developing, such as: infection from blistered or scratched skin ulcers forming on the skin permanent discolouration of the skin scarring of the skinit’s often possible to avoid complications of chilblains. do not scratch or rub the affected areas of skin do not directly overheat the chilblains (by using hot water, for example)you can also help reduce your risk of infection by cleaning any breaks in your skin with antiseptic and covering the area with an antiseptic dressing. the dressing should be changed every other day until the skin heals.if the skin does become infected,antibioticsmay be prescribed to treat the infection.',\n",

systems.people with me/cfs experience severe pain and fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise (pem). this is when the body is not able to recover after using even small amounts of energy. this fatigue feels very different from ordinary tiredness. it might take a day or 2 to kick in after physical, mental, or emotional exertion.me/cfs affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups. it doesn’t go away with sleep or rest and affects everyday life. it can sometimes be diagnosed as post viral fatigue syndrome (pvfs).the symptoms of the condition vary from person to person. there may be times when your symptoms improve and you’ll be able to do some normal everyday activities. at other times, symptoms may get worse, affecting your daily life.if you experience new symptoms, talk to your gp or specialist as the new symptoms may be unrelated to me/cfs. women often find that symptoms worsen at different times in their menstrual cycle. not everyone will experience all of the symptoms.people with me/cfs experience severe pain, fatigue and a range of other symptoms associated with pem. this is the body and

me/cfs. there might be various factors involved and there may be a number of different types of the illness. these different sub-groups still need more research to be identified, including how they lead to different experiences of the condition and how it develops.me/cfs may appear suddenly or more slowly over time. it may follow an infection, typically, but not always, viral.other possible triggers can be: trauma surgery stressful major life eventsin some cases, there may be no identifiable trigger.there’s no single test to detect me/cfs. a diagnosis is made after other possible known causes for symptoms have been excluded.the earlier the illness is recognised, the sooner you can get help to manage your symptoms. many people with me/cfs find it helps to keep a diary of their symptoms so that they can take this to their gp or specialist.your gp will usually: do a physical and mental examination to rule out other conditions ask about recent travel, tick or insect bites, unusual infections, and drug and alcohol use review current medication arrange teststhey may be able to make a diagnosis after 3 or 4 months of seeing a pattern of symptoms. anyone suspected of having me/cfs should be considered for routine blood tests to identify other possible illnesses. more investigation may be needed if the diagnosis remains in doubt.some people with me/cfs also have another long-term condition and it’s important that you talk to your gp about how to manage the symptoms of the 2 conditions.although there’s no cure for me/cfs, there are ways to help manage your symptoms.because of the complexity of the illness different things work for different people. your gp may be able to support you through managing your individual symptoms.to decide what treatment is right for you, you should look at the evidence, including published research and patient surveys. make sure you fully understand what the treatment involves before you make a decision. you have the right to decline any treatment option you do not feel comfortable with.your gp may suggest some of the following treatment options.your gp may suggest reviewing and changing the medicines you take. they’ll consider other conditions you may already be receiving treatment for alongside the most important me/cfs symptoms that need to be treated.your gp may also need to consider the combined impact of medication for symptoms and possibly for managing other conditions, especially as sensitivity to medicine is a feature of me/cfs. this could mean there may be issues around polypharmacy (use of many medications) for your healthcare professional to consider.your illness might make it more difficult for you to eat the right balance of nutrients in your diet due to loss of appetite and food intolerances. your gp may be able to advise you on how you can alter and adjust your diet.your gp may work with you or refer you to another therapist to suggest aids, activities or support that can help you to recover or adjust.balancing periods of activity and rest and noticing what activities demand most from you, can allow you to reduce the number of episodes of pem.pacing yourself involves stopping activities before you feel the impact so that you have energy in reserve. it’s easy to do too much on a good day and then feel the impact later. it can take time to change your habits and

diseasethe kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs, the size of your fist. they’re located on either side of the body, just beneath the ribcage. the main role of the kidneys is to filter waste products from the blood before converting them into urine. the kidneys also: help maintain blood pressure maintain the correct levels of chemicals in your body which, in turn, will help heart and muscles function properly produce the active form of vitamin d that keeps bones healthy produce a substance called erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cellschronic kidney disease is the reduced ability of the kidney to carry out these functions in the long-term. this is most often caused by damage to the kidneys from other conditions, most commonly diabetes and high blood pressure.read more about thecauses of chronic kidney diseaseckd is common and mainly associated with ageing. the older you get, the more likely you are to have some degree of kidney disease.it’s estimated that about 1 in 5 men and 1 in 4 women between the ages of 65 and 74 has some degree of ckd.ckd is more common in people of south asian origin (those from india, bangladesh, sri lanka and pakistan) and black people than the general population. the reasons for this include higher rates of diabetes in south asian people and higher rates of high blood pressure in african or caribbean people.there is no cure for chronic kidney disease, although treatment can slow or halt the progression of the disease and can prevent other serious conditions developing.people with ckd are known to have an increased risk of a heart attack because of changes that occur to the circulation.in a minority of people, ckd may cause kidney failure, also known as established renal failure (erf) or end-stage kidney disease. in this situation, the usual functions of the kidney stop working.to survive, people with erf may need to have artificial kidney treatment, calleddialysis, or a kidney transplant.read more abouttreating chronic kidney diseasea kidney transplant from a living donor can be planned to avoid or reduce the time someone is on dialysis. this can offer a better long term outcome for the person receiving the

donate a kidney anonymously to someone they do not knowfurther information about living donation.being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease can be worrying, but support and advice are available to help you cope.read more aboutliving with chronic kidney diseasethe main way to reduce the chances of ckd developing is to ensure any existing conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, are carefully managed.some lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of ckd developing, these include: having a healthy diet avoiding drinking excessive amounts of alcohol exercising regularly avoiding medicines that can damage the kidneyread more aboutpreventing chronic kidney diseasemost people with ckd have no symptoms because the body can tolerate even a large reduction in kidney function.in other words, we are born with a lot more kidney function than is necessary for survival. kidney function is often sufficient if only 1 kidney is working. that is why people can give a kidney to someone needing a kidney transplant.a change in kidney function is usually discovered through a routine blood or urine test. if you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your kidney function will be monitored with regular blood and urine tests, and treatment aims to keep any symptoms to a minimum.if the kidneys continue to lose function and there is progression towards kidney failure (established renal failure or erf), this will usually be tracked by blood tests and monitoring. if kidney failure does occur, the symptoms may include: weight loss and poor appetite swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention) shortness of breath blood or protein in your urine (protein in your urine is not something you will notice as it can only be detected during a urine test) an increased need to urinate, particularly at night insomnia itchy skin muscle cramps high blood pressure(hypertension) nausea erectile dysfunction in men (an inability to get or maintain an erection)these are general symptoms and can be caused by many less serious conditions. many of the symptoms above can be avoided if treatment begins at an early stage, before any symptoms appear.if you are worried by any of these symptoms, arrange to see your gp.kidney disease is most often caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys.high blood pressure(hypertension) anddiabetesare the most common causes of kidney disease.blood pressure is a measure of the pressure your heart generates in your arteries with each pulse. too much pressure can damage your body’s organs, leading to heart disease, stroke and worsening of kidney function.the cause of around 90% of cases of high blood pressure is unknown. there appears to be a link between the condition and a person’s general health, diet, and lifestyle.known risk factors for high blood pressure include: age (the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older) family history of high blood pressure (the condition seems to run in families) being of african-caribbean or south asian origin obesity lack of exercise smoking excessive alcohol consumption high amount of salt in your diet high-fat diet stresshypertension causes damage by putting strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys. this prevents the filtering process from working properly.diabetes is a condition in which the body produces no – or too little – insulin (type 1 diabetes) or has become unable to make effective use of insulin (type 2 diabetes).insulin is needed to regulate levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood, preventing the levels going too high after a meal and too low between meals.if diabetes is poorly controlled, too much glucose can build up in your blood. the glucose can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys, which affects the ability of your kidneys to filter out waste products and fluids.it is estimated that 20% to 40% of people with type 1 diabetes will develop kidney disease before they reach 50 years of age. around 30% of people with type 2 diabetes also show signs of developing kidney damage.the first sign of diabetic kidney disease is the appearance of low levels of protein in the urine. therefore, your gp will ask for an annual urine test so any kidney disease can be detected as early as possible.all people with diabetes should have a kidney check every year. early detection of kidney dysfunction in diabetes is important because it identifies people at risk or complications, such as eye problems and impotence.there are many other conditions that less commonly cause ckd, including: glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney) pyelonephritis (infection in the kidney) polycystic kidney disease (an inherited condition where both kidneys are larger than normal due to the gradual growth of masses of cysts) failure of normal kidney development in an unborn baby while developing in the womb systemic lupus erythematosus (a condition of the immune system where the body attacks the kidney as if it were foreign tissue) long-term, regular use of medicines, such as lithium andnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), including aspirin and ibuprofen blockages, for example due tokidney stonesor prostate diseasechronic kidney disease (ckd) is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests.if you are in a high-risk group for developing ckd, it is important to be regularly screened for the condition. people who are not in a high-risk group are not normally screened for ckd.annual screening is recommended for the following groups: people withhigh blood pressure(hypertension) people withdiabetes people with acute kidney injury caused by medications such as lithium ornsaidssuch as ibuprofen, kidney stones or an enlarged prostate people with cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect the heart, arteries and veins, such as coronary heart disease orheart failure) people with a family history of stage 5 ckd (see below for more information about staging) or an inherited kidney disease people with diseases that affect several parts of the body and may affect the kidneys, such as systemic lupus erythematosus people with blood in the urine (haematuria) or protein in the urine (proteinuria) where there is no known causeyour gp can advise you about whether or not you should be screened for ckd.most often, the diagnosis of kidney disease is made because a routine blood or urine test indicates the kidneys may not be functioning normally. if this happens, the test is usually repeated to confirm the diagnosis.an effective way of assessing how well your kidneys are working is to calculate your glomerular filtration rate (gfr). gfr is a measurement of how many millilitres (ml) of waste fluid your kidneys can filter from the blood in a minute (measured in ml/min). a healthy pair of kidneys should be able to filter more than 90ml/min.it is difficult to measure the gfr directly, so it is estimated using a formula. the result is called the estimated gfr or egfr. calculating your egfr involves taking a blood sample and measuring the levels of a waste product called creatinine and taking into account your age, gender and ethnic group. the result is similar to the percentage of normal kidney function. for example, an egfr of 50ml/min equates to 50% kidney function.the following tests are used to detect proteinuria (protein in the urine) urine tests – used to see whether there is blood or protein in your urine albumin and creatinine testing – this is another urine test which compares the amounts of albumin (a protein) and creatinine in your urine, and the ratio of the 2 (the albumin:creatinine ratio or acr) can be used with egfr to give doctors a more accurate idea of how the kidneys are functioninga 6-stage system, based on egfr levels, is used to describe the progression of ckd. the higher the stage, the more severe the ckd.stage 1 (sometimes called g1): the egfr is normal (above 90 or more), but other testing shows evidence of kidney damage.stage 2 (g2): the egfr has decreased slightly (60 to 89), but is still considered to be in the normal range for a young adult.if you have stage 1 or 2 ckd, it is recommended you have annual egfr tests so the progression of the condition can be carefully monitored.stage 3 is divided into 2: stage 3a (g3a) and 3b (g3b). in stage 3a, the egfr has decreased mildly (45 to 59) and this is termed a mild to moderate decrease in kidney function and should be checked annually. in stage 3b (g3b) it has decreased moderately (30 to 44) and is termed a moderate to severe reduction in kidney function and should be checked every 6 months.stage 4 (g4): the egfr has reduced severely (15 to 29). by this time, it is possible you will be experiencing symptoms of ckd. further testing should be carried out every 6 months.stage 5 (g5): the kidneys have lost almost all of their function (an egfr of below 15), which is known as established renal failure. further testing should be carried out every 3 months.however, over time, gfr can fluctuate, so one abnormal test result does not automatically mean you have ckd. a diagnosis of ckd is usually only confirmed if repeated egfr tests show your egfr is consistently lower than normal over 3 months.other tests are also used to assess the levels of damage to your kidneys: kidney scans, such as an ultrasound scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan or a computerised tomography (ct) scan, are used to find out whether there are any unusual blockages in your urine flow – in cases of advanced kidney disease, the kidneys are shrunken and have an uneven shape kidney biopsy – a small sample of kidney tissue is taken so that the cells can be examined under a microscope for damagethe following lifestyle changes are known to help reduce your blood pressure and help control ckd: stopping smoking eating a healthy, low-fat, balanced diet restricting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day not using over-the-counternonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such as ibuprofen, except when advised to by a medical professional moderating your alcohol intake so it is withinrecommended limits losing weight if you are overweight or obese doing regular exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 times a weekread more aboutpreventing high blood pressurethrough lifestyle changes.one of the main ways to reduce the progression of kidney damage is tomanage high blood pressure. good control of blood pressure is vital to protect the kidneys.people with ckd should aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmhg but if you also have diabetes you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmhg.there are many types of blood pressure drugs. medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors are used to control high blood pressure in people with ckd.as well as reducing blood pressure around the body and reducing the strain on blood vessels, ace inhibitors give additional protection to the kidney.ace inhibitors include: ramipril enalapril lisinopril perindoprilside effects of ace inhibitors include: a persistent, dry cough dizziness tiredness or weakness headachesmost of these side effects should pass within a few days, although some people continue to have a dry cough.if the side effects of ace inhibitors are particularly troublesome, you can be given an alternative medication called an angiotensin-ii receptor blocker (arb). this group of medicines includes: candesartan eprosartan irbesartan azilsartan olmesartan temisartan valsartan losartanthe side effects of arbs are uncommon, but can include dizziness.both ace inhibitors and arbs can cause a reduction in kidney function in some people and increased levels of potassium in the blood, so blood tests will need to be performed after you start treatment and whenever the dose changes. if you are on an ace inhibitor or arb and you develop a fever/infection or need medicines for other conditions, it’s important to ask your doctor if the ace inhibitor or arb needs to be temporarily stopped.studies have shown that people with ckd have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. this is because some of the risk factors for ckd are the same as those for heart attacks and strokes, including high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (atherosclerosis).statins are a type of medication used to lower cholesterol levels. cholesterol causes narrowing of the arteries that can lead to a blockage of the blood supply to the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke). statins work by blocking the effects of an enzyme in your liver (called hmg-coa reductase), which is used to make cholesterol.statins sometimes have mild side effects, including: constipation diarrhoea headaches abdominal painoccasionally, statins can cause muscle pain, weakness and tenderness. if you experience any of these symptoms, contact your gp. you may need to have a blood test or change your treatment.if you have kidney disease, you may be asked to reduce your daily fluid and salt intake. you may develop a build-up of fluid as your kidneys will not be able to get rid of fluid as well as they did before.if you are asked to reduce the amount of fluid you drink, you must also take into account fluid in foods, such as soup and yoghurt. your gp or dietitian can advise you about this.the excess fluid that occurs as a result of kidney disease often builds up in your ankles or around your lungs. you may also be given diuretics (water tablets), such as furosemide, which will help get rid of the excess fluid from your body.if you do not have any fluid retention and you have not been told to reduce your fluid intake, there is no need to do so. in fact, it could be harmful in some circumstances.many people with stage three, four and five ckd developanaemia. anaemia is a condition in which you do not have enough red blood cells. symptoms of anaemia include: tiredness lethargy shortness of breath (dyspnoea) palpitations (awareness of heartbeat)anaemia can occur because of many other conditions and your doctor will investigate to rule out other possible causes.most people with kidney disease will be given iron supplements because iron is needed for the production of red blood cells. to boost iron levels, iron may be given as tablets, such as daily ferrous sulphate tablets, or as occasional intravenous infusions.if this is not enough to treat anaemia, you may be started on injections of erythropoietin, a hormone which helps your body produce more red blood cells. these injections are often administered into a vein (intravenously) or under the skin (subcutaneously). examples of these injections include epoetin alfa, beta and zeta, darbepoetin and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta.if you have stage 4 or 5 kidney disease, you can get a build-up of phosphate in your body because your kidneys cannot get rid of it. phosphate is a mineral that, with calcium, makes up most of your bones. phosphate is obtained through diet, mainly dairy foods. the kidneys usually filter out excess phosphate. if phosphate levels rise too much, it can upset the normal calcium balance of the body. this can lead to thinning of the bones and furring of the arteries.you may be asked to limit the amount of phosphate in your diet. foods high in phosphate include red meat, dairy produce, eggs and fish. your gp or dietitian should be able to advise you about how much phosphate you can eat. however, there is no advantage in reducing your intake of these foods unless you have a raised phosphate level. always ask a healthcare professional before changing your diet.if reducing the amount of phosphate in your diet does not lower your phosphate level enough, you may be given medicines called phosphate binders. these medicines bind to the phosphate in the food inside your stomach and stop it from being absorbed into your body.to work properly, phosphate binders must be taken just before meals. the most commonly used phosphate binder is calcium carbonate, but there are also alternatives that may be more suitable for you.the side effects of phosphate binders are uncommon but include: nausea stomach ache constipation diarrhoea flatulence (wind) skin rash itchy skinpeople with kidney disease can have low levels of vitamin d, necessary for healthy bones. this is because the kidneys need to activate the vitamin d from food and the sun before it can be used by the body.many people with kidney failure can continue with treatment using medicines and will have good-functioning kidneys for the rest of their lives.in a few people, kidney disease will progress to the stage where the kidneys stop working and it becomes life threatening. this is called kidney failure or established renal failure (erf).this rarely happens suddenly, and there will be time to plan the next stage of your condition. the decision whether to have dialysis, a kidney transplant or supportive treatment should be discussed with your healthcare team.read more aboutdialysisand kidney transplants.if you decide not to have dialysis or a transplant for kidney failure, or they are not suitable for you, you will be offered supportive treatment.this is also called palliative care.the aim is to treat and control the symptoms of kidney failure without using dialysis or transplantation. supportive treatment includes medical, psychological and practical care for both the person with kidney failure and their family, including discussion about how you feel andplanning for the end of life.many people choose supportive treatment because they: are unlikely to benefit or have quality of life with treatment do not want to go through the inconvenience of treatment with dialysis are advised against dialysis because they have other serious illnesses that will shorten their life, and the negative aspects of treatment outweigh any likely benefits have been on dialysis but have decided to stop this treatment are being

terms with a condition such as kidney disease can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. it can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they are close to you.learning about kidney disease often helps because you and your family will understand more about what to expect and feel more in control of the illness, instead of feeling that your lives are now dominated by kidney disease and its treatment.be open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. however, do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.your gp or nurse can reassure you if you have questions about your kidney disease, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline operator. your gp practice will have information on these.some people find it helpful to talk to other people with kidney disease at a local support group or online.if you have to stop work or work part time because of your kidney disease, you may find it hard to cope financially. you may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support: if you have a job but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled tostatutory sick payfrom your employer if you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled toemployment and support allowance if you are aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible fordisability living allowance if you are aged 65 or over, you may be able to getattendance allowance if you are caring for someone with kidney disease, you may be entitled tocarer’s allowance you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household incomethe symptoms of kidney disease and the stress it causes in your life can affect your sexual relationships.some couples become closer after a diagnosis of kidney disease, while others find that their loved ones are affected by worries about how they will cope with the effects of the illness. both men and women may experience issues about body image and self-esteem, and this can affect the relationship.try to share your feelings with your partner. if you have problems with sex that do not get better with time, speak to a counsellor or sex therapist.people on dialysis often experience specific sexual difficulties. loss of sex drive in both men and women and impotence in men are commonly reported problems.treatment is available, but it may take some time and requires commitment from both partners. the first step is to discuss it with your healthcare team.both men and women with early stage kidney disease will find their fertility is unaffected. this means it is important to use contraception unless you want to have a baby.later stage kidney disease may affect women’s periods, which can make pregnancy more difficult. for men, later stage kidney disease can cause a reduction in sperm count. however, having kidney disease does not mean you will not get pregnant or be able to father a child, so both men and women need to use an effective method of contraception unless they want to have a baby.women who want to have a baby should talk to their renal specialist or an obstetrician with an interest in kidney disease. depending on the stage of kidney disease, there can be risks to both the mother and the baby. it is important to minimise any risk with a planned pregnancy. your healthcare team can advise you about this.if you have mild kidney disease or you’ve had a transplant, going on holiday shouldn’t pose additional health problems, whether you’re staying in the uk or going abroad.if you’re on dialysis, you can still enjoy holidays provided you book your treatment before you go away.if you’re on dialysis and want to travel, discuss your plans with your renal unit as early as you can. it can sometimes be more difficult to arrange dialysis in the uk than it is abroad.the nhs will look after you if you get ill while on holiday in the uk. if you’re in europe, theeuropean health insurance card (ehic)entitles you to free or reduced-cost hospital treatment.it’s a good idea to take out holiday health insurance in addition to carrying the ehic. anyone with kidney disease should declare it as a pre-existing medical condition on standard insurance application forms. it may exclude you from some policies.some remedies are potentially harmful for people with kidney disease. make sure you check with your doctor before taking a new over the counter medicine.you’re at higher risk of being harmed by certain over the counter remedies if: you have advanced kidney disease (stage 4 or 5, or a kidney function below 30% of normal) you have mild-to-moderate kidney disease (stage 3 with a kidney function between 30 and 60% of normal) and are elderly with another serious illness, such as coronary heart diseasesummarised below is a list of which over the counter remedies are safe for people with kidney disease to use and which should be avoided. this is just a guide. for more detailed information, consult your pharmacist, renal specialist or gp.paracetamol is safe and the best choice of painkiller to treat a headache, but avoid soluble products as they are high in sodium. if your kidney function is less than about 50%, avoid painkillers containing aspirin,ibuprofenor similar drugs such as diclofenac. these products can deteriorate the function of damaged kidneys.low-dose aspirinof 75mg to 150mg a day can be used if it’s prescribed for the prevention of vascular disease. you should also avoid ibuprofen if you’re taking anti-rejection treatment following a kidney transplant.many of the products available for coughs and colds contain a mixture of ingredients, so check the packaging carefully. some products contain paracetamol, which is safe, but others contain high doses of aspirin, which it’s best to avoid.many cold remedies also containdecongestants, which you should avoid if you have high blood pressure. the best way to clear congestion is by steam inhalation with menthol or eucalyptus. for coughs, try a simple linctus or glycerine honey and lemon to soothe your throat.if you have muscle or joint pain, it’s ideal to use topical preparations (applied to the skin), which are rubbed on to the painful area. avoid tablets containing ibuprofen or similar drugs such as diclofenac if your kidney function is below 50%. ibuprofen gel or spray is safer than ibuprofen tablets, but it isn’t completely risk-free as a small amount of the drug penetrates the skin into the bloodstream.about 1% of people with stage three ckd develop kidney failure, also called established renal failure (erf). kidney failure has a major impact on your life and the lives of those close to you. people diagnosed with kidney failure usually go through shock, grief and denial before they accept their condition.if you have established renal failure (erf), you will need to decide whether to have treatment withdialysisor a kidney transplant. you may decide to have neither treatment and to have supportive care. these choices should be made with your healthcare team.for people who want active treatment for their erf, a transplant would be the best option. however, a transplant is only suitable for about half of all people with erf. this is because they may have had recent cancer or are not physically fit.many people who have slowly progressive kidney failure and other serious health problems, and who are usually older, may choose to avoid dialysis. supportive care can still allow you to live for some time with a good quality of life.a kidney transplant, when suitable, is the best treatment for erf. the transplanted kidney can be obtained from a deceased or living donor and survival rates are now extremely good. about 90% of transplants still function after five years and many transplants work usefully after 20 years. the main reason people have to wait for a transplant is the shortage of available donors.over a third of kidney transplants are now from live donors. a live donor kidney can be transplanted before the need for dialysis, rather than after a period of time on dialysis.one major risk after transplantation is rejection, where the immune system attacks the donated kidney because it mistakes it for a foreign object. this is prevented with the use of strong drugs to suppress the immune system. these drugs need to be taken meticulously. they are usually well tolerated but may have side effects, including an increased susceptibility to infections and some forms of cancer. for this reason, transplant patients are given regular reviews in a specialist transplant clinic.dialysis can take place at home or in hospital. it involves filtering the blood of waste products and excess water. it is not as efficient as a human kidney, so people with kidney failure usually need to restrict their intake of fluid and certain foods. they also require additional medicines such as iron supplements, phosphate binders and antihypertensive medicine (to reduce blood pressure). there are 2 types of dialysis: peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis.the abdomen (tummy) has a lining called the peritoneal membrane, which can be used as a filter to remove excess waste and water. if you have opted for peritoneal dialysis, a tube (catheter) will be inserted into your abdomen during an operation. this will allow you to drain dialysis fluid in and out of your tummy yourself. you will not need to go into hospital to be treated, but you will have to spend an hour or two each day draining the fluid. the treatment involves either four exchanges spaced out during the day, each taking half an hour, or attaching yourself to a machine overnight that pumps the fluid in and out for you.haemodialysis removes waste products and excess fluid that build up in the body when the kidneys stop working. blood is taken from the body to be cleaned in a filter known as a dialyser. it is effectively an artificial kidney. the whole process takes about four hours and usually has to be repeated three times a week. most people go into hospital to have haemodialysis. however, some people choose to have the treatment in their own home.home haemodialysis will give you more flexibility, but comes with greater responsibility. you’ll need to have the space in your home for a dedicated machine and, in most cases, a lot of support from a close family member or friend. some people choose to have their dialysis at night while they are asleep. most people who choose home haemodialysis have it every day, so their fluid intake is not as restricted.during haemodialysis, it is important that large volumes of blood are passed through the machine. this requires special measures to get into large enough blood vessels. for this reason, haemodialysis patients need a minor operation to join one of the deep arteries to a superficial vein (called a fistula). this is carried out in day surgery and should be done at least 6 weeks before dialysis is required because it needs time to mature before it can be used.occasionally, there will be insufficient time for a fistula to be created before dialysis is required. in this case, a temporary solution is found, usually involving the use of an indwelling plastic dialysis catheter. a catheter is a surgical tube inserted into the body to allow for the transfer of fluid.all the issues will be discussed in detail with you by the dialysis team before any decisions are made. dialysis lab tests online: gfr test national kidney federation kidney care uk kidney research uk uk

       " 'Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia': 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and tends to progress slowly over many years.it mostly affects people over the age of 60 and is rare in people under 40. children are almost never affected.in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll), the spongy material found inside some bones (bone marrow) produces too many white blood cells called lymphocytes that aren’t fully developed and don’t work properly.over time this can cause a range of problems, such as an increased risk of picking up infections, persistent tiredness, swollen glands in the neck, armpits or groin, and unusual bleeding or bruising.cll is different from other types of leukaemia, includingchronic myeloid leukaemia,acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaandacute myeloid leukaemia.cll doesn’t usually cause any symptoms early on and may only be picked up during ablood testcarried out for another reason.when symptoms develop, they may include: getting infections often anaemia – persistent tiredness,shortness of breathand pale skin bleeding and bruising more easily than normal a high temperature (fever) night sweats swollen glandsin your neck, armpits or groin swelling and discomfort in your tummy unintentional weight lossyou should speak to your gp if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. these symptoms can have other causes other than cancer, but it’s a good idea to get them checked out.read more aboutdiagnosing cllandcomplications of cll.as cll progresses slowly and often has no symptoms at first, you may not need to be treated immediately.if it’s caught early on, you’ll have regular check-ups over the following months or years to see if it’s getting any worse.if cll starts to cause symptoms, or isn’t diagnosed until later on, the main treatments are: chemotherapy– where medication is taken as a tablet or given directly into a vein is used to destroy the cancerous cells astem cell or bone marrow transplant– where donated cells called stem cells are transplanted into your body so you start to produce healthy white blood cellstreatment can’t usually cure cll completely, but can slow its progression and lead to periods where there are no symptoms. treatment may be repeated if the condition comes back.read more abouttreating cll.the outlook for cll depends on how advanced it is when it’s diagnosed, how old you are when diagnosed, and your general health.younger, healthier people who are diagnosed when cll is still in the early stages generally have the best outlook.although it can’t normally be cured, treatment can help control the condition for many years.it’s not clear what causes cll. there’s no proven link withradiationor chemical exposure, diet or infections. you can’t catch it from anyone else or pass it on.however, having certain genes can increase your chances of developing cll. you may be at a slightly higher risk of it if you have a close family member with it, although this risk is still small.most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) are detected during blood tests carried out for another reason.however, you should speak to your gp if you have worryingsymptoms of cll, such as persistent tiredness, unusual bleeding or bruising, unexplained weight loss or night sweats.your gp may: ask about your symptoms and your medical and family history carry out a physical examination to check for problems such asswollen glandsand a swollen spleen send off a blood sample for testingif your gp thinks you could have cll, you’ll be referred to a hospital doctor called a haematologist, a specialist in blood disorders, for further tests.the main test used to help diagnose cll is a type ofblood testcalled a full blood count.this is where the number and appearance of the different blood cells in a sample of your blood are checked in a laboratory.an abnormally high number of unusual white blood cells (lymphocytes) can be a sign of cll. a detailed examination of these cells can usually confirm the diagnosis.you may also have: a chestx-ray anultrasoundof your tummy acomputerised tomography (ct) scanthese tests can check for problems caused by cll, such as swollen glands or a swollen spleen, and help rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.sometimes the haematologist may recommend removing a sample of your bone marrow (bone marrow biopsy) so they can examine it under a microscope to check it for cancerous cells.the sample is removed using a needle inserted into your hip bone.local anaestheticis normally used to numb the area where the needle is inserted, although you may experience some discomfort during the biopsy.the procedure will last around 15 minutes and you shouldn’t need to stay in hospital overnight. you may have some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards.in some cases, removing and examining a swollen lymph gland can help confirm a diagnosis of cll. this is known as a lymph node biopsy.the gland is removed during a minor operation carried out under either local orgeneral anaesthetic, where you’re asleep. you won’t usually need to stay in hospital overnight.after the operation, you’ll be left with a small wound that will be closed with stitches.tests may also be carried out on your blood and bone marrow samples to check for any unusual genes in the cancerous cells.identifying unusual genes in these cells can help your doctors decide how soon you should start treatment and which treatment is best for you.sometreatments for clldon’t work as well in people with certain abnormal genes in the affected cells.treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) largely depends on what stage the condition is at when it’s diagnosed.you may just need to be monitored at first if it’s caught early on.chemotherapyis the main treatment if it’s more advanced.treatment can often help keep cll under control for many years.it may go away after treatment initially (known as remission), but will usually come back (relapse) a few months or years later and may need to be treated again.doctors use stages to describe how far cll has developed and help them determine when it needs to be treated.there are 3 main stages of cll: stage a – you have enlarged lymph glands in fewer than 3 areas (such as your neck, armpit or groin) and a high white blood cell count stage b – you have enlarged lymph glands in 3 or more areas and a high white blood cell count stage c – you have enlarged lymph glands or an enlarged spleen, a high white blood cell count, and a low red blood cell or platelet countstage b and c cll are usually treated straight away. stage a generally only needs to be treated if it’s getting worse quickly or starting to cause symptoms.treatment may not be needed if you don’t have any symptoms when you’re diagnosed with cll.this is because: cll often develops very slowly and may not cause symptoms for many years there’s no benefit in starting treatment early treatment can cause significant side effectsin these cases, you will normally just need regular visits to your doctor andblood teststo monitor the condition.treatment with chemotherapy will usually only be recommended if you develop symptoms, or tests show that the condition is getting worse.many people with cll will eventually need to have chemotherapy. this involves taking medication to keep the cancer under control.there are a number of different medicines for cll, but most people will take 3 main medications in treatment cycles lasting 28 days.these medicines are: fludarabine – usually taken as a tablet for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle cyclophosphamide – also usually taken as a tablet for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle rituximab – given into a vein over the course of a few hours (intravenous infusion) at the start of each treatment cyclefludarabine and cyclophosphamide can usually be taken at home. rituximab is given in hospital, and sometimes you may need to stay in hospital overnight.a number of different medicines can also be tried if you can’t have these medicines, you’ve tried them but they didn’t work, or your cll has come back after treatment.these include bendamustine, chlorambucil, ibrutinib, idelalisib, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab and prednisolone (asteroid medication).the medicines used to treat cll can cause some significant side effects, including: persistent tiredness feeling sick an increased risk of infections easy bruising or bleeding anaemia –shortness of breath, weakness and pale skin hair lossor thinning an irregular heartbeat anallergic reactionmost side effects will pass once treatment stops. let your care team know if you experience any side effects, as there are some treatments that can help.read more about theside effects of chemotherapystem cell or bone marrow transplantsare sometimes used to try to get rid of cll completely, or control it for longer periods.stem cells are cells produced by the spongy material found in the centre of some bones (bone marrow) that can turn into different types of blood cells, including white blood cells.a stem cell transplant involves: having high-dose chemotherapy andradiotherapyto destroy the cancerous cells in your body removing stem cells from the blood or bone marrow of a donor – this will ideally be someone closely related to you, such as a sibling transplanting the donor stem cells directly into one of your veinsthis is the only potential cure for cll, but it’s not done very often as it’s an intensive treatment and many people with cll are older and not well enough for the benefits to outweigh the risks.the initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy can place a significant strain on your body and cause troublesome side effects.there’s also a risk of serious problems after the transplant, such as graft versus host disease. this is where the transplanted cells attack the other cells in your body.there are also a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to help treat some of the problems caused by cll, particularly if you can’t have chemotherapy or it doesn’t work.these include: radiotherapyto shrink enlarged lymph glands or a swollen spleen surgery to remove a swollen spleen antibiotics, antifungals and antiviral medications to help reduce your risk of picking up an infection during treatment blood transfusionsto provide more red blood cells and platelets (clotting cells) if you experience severe anaemia or problems with bleeding and bruising immunoglobulin replacement therapy – a transfusion of antibodies taken from donated blood that can help prevent infections injections of medication called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) to help boost the number of white blood cellsyou may also need additional treatment for anycomplications of cllthat develop.as many of the treatments for cll can have unpleasant side effects that may affect your quality of life, you may decide against having a particular type of treatment.this is entirely your decision and your treatment team will respect any decision you make.you won’t be rushed into deciding about your treatment, and before making a decision you can talk to your doctor, partner, family and friends.pain relief and nursing care will still be available as and when you need it.chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) can sometimes cause a number of further complications.people with cll usually have a weakened immune system and are more vulnerable to infections because they have a lack of healthy, infection-fighting white blood cells.treatment withchemotherapycan also further weaken the immune system.if you have cll, it’s a good idea to: report any possible symptoms of an infection to your gp or care team immediately – things to look out for include a high temperature (fever), aching muscles,diarrhoeaorheadaches ensure your vaccinations are up-to-date – speak to your gp or care team for advice about any additional vaccines you might need, as some aren’t safe if you have a weak immune system avoid close contact with anyone who has an infection – even if it’s an infection to which you were previously immune, such aschickenpoxyou may also be prescribed regular doses of medications such asantibioticsto help reduce the risk of infection.in up to 1 in every 20 people with cll, the condition will change to become very similar to an aggressive form ofnon-hodgkin lymphoma. this is called richter’s transformation or richter’s syndrome.symptoms of richter’s syndrome include: sudden swelling of your lymph glands a high temperature (fever) night sweats unintentional weight loss tummy (abdominal) painrichter syndrome is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and other powerful medicines.the cancer research uk website has more information onrichter’s syndrome.around 1 in every 10 people with cll will develop a condition called autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.this is where the immune system starts to attack and destroy red blood cells. it can cause severe anaemia, making you feel breathless and easily tired.it’s usually treated withsteroid medicationbeing diagnosed with cll can be very distressing and difficult to take in at first, particularly as it can’t necessarily be cured and you may be advised to wait for it to get worse before starting treatment.having to wait years to see how the condition develops can also be very stressful and make you feel anxious ordepressed. speak to your gp or care team if you’re finding it difficult to cope.you may also find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. your gp or care team will be able to provide you with the details of support groups in your area.macmillan cancer supportprovides an excellent level of help and support. their helpline number is0808 808 00 00, monday to friday, 9am to 8pm.it’s not known what causes most cases of leukaemia. however, there are many risk factors that are known to increase your chances of getting chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia include: having a family history of the condition being of european, american or australian origin having certain medical conditions being malein some cases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia appears to run in families. it’s thought that an inherited gene mutation (change to a gene) could increase your susceptibility to developing the condition. this means there may be certain genes in your family that make it more likely that you’ll develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.more research is needed, but having a parent or sibling (brother or sister) with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia slightly increases your chances of also developing the condition.chronic lymphocytic leukaemia most commonly affects people of european, american and australian origin.it’s rare in people from china, japan and south east asia, and it affects more white people than black people. it’s not known why the condition affects people of some ethnic backgrounds and not others.research has shown that having certain medical conditions slightly increases your chances of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. these conditions include: pneumonia (chest infection) sinusitis shingles autoimmune haemolytic anaemia long-term (chronic)osteoarthritis prostatitis (an inflamed prostate)however, rather than causing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, some of these conditions may occur as a result of having lowered immunity during the early stages of the condition.having a lowered immunity due to having a condition such ashiv or aids, or taking immunity lowering medication following an organ transplant can also increase your risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.exposure to radiation is known to increase the risk of getting other types of leukaemia, but it’s not been linked specifically to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.thecancer research ukwebsite has more information about therisk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.for reasons that are unclear, men are around twice as likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia than women. the risk of developing leukaemia also increases as you get older. chemotherapy cancer research uk: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) blood cancer uk: chronic

       " 'Chronic myeloid leukaemia': 'leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. chronic leukaemia means the condition progresses slowly over many years. chronic leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected by cancer. there are 2 main types: lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damagethese pages focus on chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is a cancer of the myeloid cells. the following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia acute myeloid leukaemia acute lymphoblastic leukaemiayour bone marrow produces stem cells. these are unique cells because they have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cell: red blood cells – which carry oxygen around the body white blood cells – which help fight infection platelets – which help stop bleedingin leukaemia, a genetic mutation in the stem cells causes a huge over-production of white blood cells and a corresponding drop in red blood cells and platelets.it’s this lack of red blood cells which causes symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and the lack of platelets that increases the risk of excessive bleeding.in its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms. as the condition develops, symptoms include: tiredness weight loss night sweats a feeling of bloating bruising bone painread more about thesymptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemiachronic myeloid leukaemia is quite a rare type of cancer.chronic myeloid leukaemia can affect people of any age, but it is more common in people aged 40 to 60. there is no evidence that it runs in families.in its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms and it is often diagnosed during tests for a different condition.when symptoms do develop, they are similar to those of many other illnesses and can include: tiredness frequent infections unexplained weight loss a feeling of bloating less commonly, swollen lymph nodes – glands found in the neck and under your arms, which are usually painlesschronic myeloid leukaemia can also cause swelling in your spleen (an organ that helps to filter impurities from your blood). this can cause a lump to appear on the left side of your abdomen, which may be painful when touched. a swollen spleen can also put pressure on your stomach, causing a lack of appetite and indigestion.the symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia in its advanced stage will be much more noticeable and troublesome. they include: severe fatigue bone pain night sweats fever easily bruised skinchronic myeloid leukaemia is caused by a dna mutation in the stem cells which produce white blood cells.the change in the dna causes the stem cells to produce more white blood cells than are needed.they are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature and able to fight infection like healthy ‘adult’ white blood cells.as the number of immature cells increases, the number of healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it’s this fall which causes many of the symptoms of chronic leukaemia.although the cause of chronic myeloid leukaemia is genetic, it is not inherited as it is an acquired genetic abnormality.most people with the condition have an abnormal chromosome, where a section of dna from one chromosome has been swapped with a section from another.this is called the philadelphia chromosome and it makes the cell produce a protein that encourages the leukaemic cells to resist normal cell death and grow and multiply far more quickly than usual.what triggers the development of chronic leukaemia and causes the initial mutation in stem cells is unknown. the one proven risk factor is exposure to radiation.however, radiation is only a significant risk if the levels are extremely high, such as those recorded after an atomic bomb explodes, or those released after a nuclear reactor accident, such as the one at chernobyl.there is limited evidence that prolonged exposure to the chemical benzene leads to an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia. benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry, but in the uk there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.benzene is also found in cigarettes. however, it is thought that smoking is more of a risk factor inacute leukaemiathan it is in chronic leukaemia.a number of occupations have been linked to an increased risk of chronic leukaemia, possibly due to exposure to certain substances such as pesticides or chemicals.these occupations include: all types of agricultural workers people who are involved with rubber or plastic manufacture tailors and dressmakers cleaners builder’s labourerthere is some evidence to show an increased risk of chronic leukaemia in people who: areobese have a weakened immune system – due tohiv or aidsor taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant have inflammatory bowel disease – such asulcerative colitisorcrohn’s diseasechronic myeloid leukaemia is often first detected when a routine blood test is carried out to diagnose another, unrelated, condition.ablood testthat reveals abnormally high levels of white blood cells could be a sign of chronic leukaemia. if you have a blood test with abnormal results, you will be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further testing.to confirm a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. this procedure is known as a bone marrowbiopsy. a bone marrow biopsy is usually carried out under alocal anaesthetic.the haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a needle to remove the bone marrow sample. you may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. the procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you should not have to stay in hospital overnight.the bone marrow sample will be checked to see if there are cancerous cells. if there are, the biopsy will also be able to help determine which type of chronic leukaemia is present.there are a number of additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. these can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated.cytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. there are a number of specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment.for example, 90% of people with chronic myeloid leukaemia have the philadelphia chromosome. people who have this chromosome are known to respond well to a medicine called imatinib.a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test can be done on a blood sample. this is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment.the blood test is repeated every 3 months for at least 2 years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved.in some cases, the hospital may want to perform some imaging tests to help rule out other conditions or confirm a diagnosis. this may be either: anx-ray– usually to examine your chest anultrasound scan– usually to examine your spleen and liverimatinib tablets are usually given as soon as you have been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia, to slow its progression. these tablets are taken every day for life, and most patients do really well on them.the aim of treatment is to achieve the following: by 3 months, correct the blood count by 12 months, clear the bone marrow of cells containing the philadelphia chromosome (seecausespage for information on this) by 18 months, get to a stage where the leukaemia can only be detected by a very sensitive molecular test (molecular remission)chemotherapyis usually offered if the cancer reaches an advanced stage.a medicine called imatinib is the main treatment recommended for chronic myeloid leukaemia. it is usually given as soon as a diagnosis is made because the medicine is designed to slow the progression of the cancer and to prevent the condition reaching the accelerated or advanced phase.imatinib is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor. this means it blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase (tyrosine kinase helps to stimulate the growth of cancer cells). this reduces the production of abnormal white blood cells.imatinib is taken as a tablet. the side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve with time. they include: nausea vomiting swelling in the face and lower legs muscle cramps rash diarrhoeait is estimated that 10 to 40% of people who take imatinib become resistant to its effects, so an alternative treatment is required.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has recommended nilotinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia that is resistant or intolerant to imatinib. in some cases, nilotinib is recommended as the first treatment.nilotinib works in a similar way to imatinib in that it blocks the effects of proteins that help stimulate the growth of cancer cells.side effects of nilotinib can include: vomiting abdominal pain bone and joint pain dry skin loss of appetite hair loss insomnia night sweats dizziness tingling or numbnessif the side effects become particularly troublesome, temporarily stopping the treatment usually helps to bring them under control. treatment can then be resumed, possibly using a lower dose of medication.read about thecomplications of chronic myeloid leukaemiafor more information and advice about being vulnerable to infection and bleeding.once chronic myeloid leukaemia has progressed to a more advanced stage, chemotherapy is the next treatment.chemotherapy tablets are usually used first because they have fewer and milder side effects than chemotherapy injections. side effects include: tiredness skin rash increased vulnerability to infectionchemotherapy can weaken your immune system, which helps protect you against infection. this is known as being immunocompromised. readchronic leukaemia complicationsfor more information about this.if your symptoms persist or get worse, chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy) will need to be used. intravenous chemotherapy causes more side effects than chemotherapy tablets and they tend to be more severe.side effects include: nausea vomiting tiredness hair loss infertilitythese side effects should resolve after your treatment has finished, although there is a risk that infertility could be permanent.a bone marrow transplant can offer a cure for chronic leukaemia, although it is only suitable and necessary for some patients.before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant has to have aggressive, high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body.this can put enormous strain on the body and can cause significant side effects and potential complications. transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person who is receiving the donation. the best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type.due to these issues, transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people in good health, and there is a suitable brother or sister who can provide a donation.in most cases of chronic leukaemia, the potential risks of transplantation far outweigh any benefit.however, your specific circumstances may mean that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.read more aboutbone marrow transplantsbeing immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with chronic leukaemia.there are 2 reasons for this: the lack of healthy white blood cells means your immune system is less able to fight infection many of the medicines used to treat chronic leukaemia can weaken the immune systemthis means you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications.you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections from occurring. you should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your gp or care team because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications.symptoms of infection include: high temperature (fever) of 38c (101.4f) or above headache aching muscles diarrhoea tirednessavoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. this is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered).while it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour.also ensure that all of yourvaccinationsare up-to-date. your gp or care team will be able to advise you about this. you will be unable to have any vaccine that contains activated particles of viruses or bacteria, such as: the mumps, measles and rubella (mmr) vaccine the polio vaccine the oral typhoid vaccine the bcg vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis) the yellow fever vaccinereceiving a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. at first, the news may be difficult to take in.the situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings of stress,anxietyanddepression.if you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition.you may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. your gp or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups.another excellent resource

       " 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease': 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is the name for a collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease.people with copd have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is called airflow obstruction.typical symptoms of copd include: increasing breathlessness when active a persistent cough with phlegm frequent chest infectionsread more about thesymptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasethe main cause of copd is smoking. the likelihood of developing copd increases the more you smoke and the longer you’ve been smoking. this is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, which results in scarring.over many years, the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung. the walls of the airways thicken and more mucus is produced. damage to the delicate walls of the air sacs in the lungs causes emphysema and the lungs lose their normal elasticity. the smaller airways also become scarred and narrowed. these changes cause the symptoms of breathlessness, cough and phlegm associated with copd.some cases of copd are caused by fumes, dust, air pollution and genetic disorders, but these are rarer.read more about thecauses of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasecopd is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the uk. it usually only starts to affect people over the age of 35, although most people are not diagnosed until they are in their 50s.it is thought there are more than 3 million people living with the disease in the uk, of which only about 900,000 have been diagnosed. this is because many people who develop symptoms of copd do not get medical help because they often dismiss their symptoms as a ‘smoker’s cough’.copd affects more men than women, although rates in women are increasing.it is important that copd is diagnosed as early as possible so treatment can be used to try to slow down the deterioration of your lungs. you should see your gp if you have any of the symptoms of copd.copd is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your doctor, which may be followed by breathing tests.read more aboutdiagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasealthough the damage that has already occurred to your lungs cannot be reversed, you can slow down the progression of the disease. stopping smoking is particularly effective at doing this.treatments for copd usually involve relieving the symptoms with medication, for example by using an inhaler to make breathing easier. pulmonary rehabilitation may also help increase the amount of exercise you are capable of doing.surgery is only an option for a small number of people with copd.read more abouttreating chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasecopd can affect your life in many ways, but help is available to reduce its impact.simple steps such as living in a healthy way, being as active as possible, learning breathing techniques, and taking your medication can help you to reduce the symptoms of copd.financial support and advice about relationships and end of life care is also available for people with copd.read more aboutliving with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.although copd causes about 25,000 deaths a year in the uk, severe copd can usually be prevented by making changes to your lifestyle.if you smoke, stopping is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of getting the condition.research has shown you are up to four times more likely to succeed in giving up smoking

exposure to tobacco smoke as much as possible.symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) usually develop over a number of years, so you may not be aware you have the condition.copd does not usually become noticeable until after the age of 35 and most people diagnosed with the condition are over 50 years old.see your gp if you have the following symptoms: increasing breathlessness when exercising or moving around a persistent cough with phlegm that never seems to go away frequentchest infections, particularly in winter wheezingmiddle-aged smokers and ex-smokers who have a persistent chesty cough (especially in the morning), breathlessness on slight exertion or persistent coughs and colds in the winter should see their gp or practice nurse for a simple breathing test.if you have copd, the airways of the lungs become inflamed and narrowed. as the air sacs get permanently damaged, it will become increasingly difficult to breathe out.while there is currently no cure for copd, the sooner the condition is diagnosed and appropriate treatment begins, the less chance there is of severe lung damage.read more abouttreating copd.symptoms of copd are often worse in winter, and it is common to have two or more flare-ups a year. a flare-up (also known as an exacerbation) is when your symptoms are particularly bad. this is one of the most common reasons for people being admitted to hospital in the uk.if you’re experiencing a flare-up that is worse than normal day to day, you should visit your gp or call nhs 24 on 111.other signs of copd can include: weight loss tiredness and fatigue swollen ankleschest pain and coughing up blood (haemoptysis) are not common symptoms of copd. they are usually caused by other conditions such as achest infectionor, less commonly,lung cancer.there are several things that may increase your risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), many of which can be avoided.you can reduce your risk of developing copd by not smoking and avoiding exposure to certain substances at work.smoking is the main cause of copd and is thought to be responsible for around 90% of cases. the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and permanently damaged by smoking and this damage cannot be reversed.up to 25% of smokers develop copd.exposure to other people’s smoke increases the risk of copd.exposure to certain types of dust and chemicals at work, including grains, isocyanates, cadmium and coal, has been linked to the development of copd, even in people who do not smoke.the risk of copd is even higher if you breathe in dust or fumes in the workplace and you smoke.according to some research, air pollution may be an additional risk factor for copd. however, at the moment it is not conclusive and research is continuing.read further information: stopping smoking treatments to help you stop smoking health and safety executive: copdthere are a few factors for copd that you cannot change.a research study has shown that smokers who have brothers and sisters with severe copd are at greater risk of developing the condition than smokers who do not.there is a rare genetic tendency to develop copd called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. this causes copd in a small number of people (about 1%). alpha-1-antitrypsin is a protein that protects your lungs. without it, the lungs can be damaged by other enzymes that occur naturally in the body.people who have an alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency usually develop copd at a younger age, often under 35.read further information: british lung foundation:alpha-1-antitrypsin alpha1 awareness ukchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your gp, as well as breathing tests.if you are concerned about the health of your lungs and have symptoms that could be copd, see your gp as soon as you can.being diagnosed early means you will receive appropriate treatment, advice and help to stop or slow the progression of copd.at a consultation, your doctor will ask about your symptoms, how long you have had them, and whether you smoke, or used to smoke. they will examine you and listen to your chest using a stethoscope. you may also be weighed and measured to calculate your body mass index (bmi).your doctor will also check how well your lungs are working with a lung function test called spirometery.to assess how well your lungs work, a breathing test called spirometry is carried out. you will be asked to breathe into a machine called a spirometer.the spirometer takes two measurements: the volume of air you can breathe out in one second (called the forced expiratory volume in one second or fev1) and the total amount of air you breathe out (called the forced vital capacity or fvc).you may be asked to breathe out a few times to get a consistent reading.the readings are compared with normal measurements for your age, which can show if your airways are obstructed.you may have other tests as well as spirometry. often, these other tests will help the doctor rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms.a chestx-raywill show whether you have another lung condition which may be causing symptoms, such as achest infectionor lung cancer.ablood testwill show whether your symptoms could be due toanaemia, as this can also cause breathlessness.some people may need more tests. the tests may confirm the diagnosis or indicate the severity of your copd. this will help you and your doctor plan your treatment.an electrocardiogram (ecg) or echocardiogram may be used to check the condition of your heart.an ecg involves attaching electrodes (sticky metal patches) to your arms, legs and chest to pick up the electrical signals from your heart.an echocardiogram uses sound waves to build a detailed picture of your heart. this is similar to anultrasound scan.to confirm you have copd and not asthma, you may be asked to take regular measurements of your breathing using a peak flow meter, at different times over several days. the peak flow meter measures how fast you can breathe out.the level of oxygen in your blood is measured using a pulse oximeter, which looks like a peg and is attached to the finger. if you have low levels of oxygen, you may need an assessment to see whether extra oxygen would help you.if the condition runs in your family or you developed the symptoms of copd under the age of 35 and have never smoked, you will probably have a blood test to see if you are alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient.some people may need act scan. this provides more information than an x-ray and can be useful in diagnosing other lung diseases or assessing changes to your lungs due to copd.if your symptoms seem worse than would be expected from your spirometry results, your doctor may decide you need more detailed lung function tests. you may be referred to a hospital specialist for these tests.the doctor may take a sample of phlegm (sputum) to check whether it has been infected.stopping smokingis the most effective way for people with copd to help themselves feel better and is the only proven way to reduce the rate of decline in lung function.stopping smoking at an early stage of the disease makes a huge difference. any damage already done to the airways cannot be reversed, but giving up smoking can slow the rate at which the condition worsens.if copd is in the early stages and symptoms are mild, no other treatments may be needed. however, it is never too late to stop smoking. even people with fairly advanced copd are likely to benefit from quitting, which may prevent further damage to the airways.research has shown you are up to four times more likely to give up smoking successfully if you use nhs support along with stop-smoking medicines such as tablets, patches or gum. ask your doctor about this.read more aboutstopping smoking.if an inhaler is prescribed for you, your gp, practice nurse or pharmacist can explain how to use it. they will check you are using it properly.most people learn to use an inhaler successfully, but if you are having problems, a spacer or a different type of inhaler device may help you take your medicines correctly. a spacer is a device that increases the amount of medication that reaches the lungs.short-acting bronchodilator inhalers deliver a small dose of medicine directly to your lungs, causing the muscles in your airways to relax and open up.there are two types of short-acting bronchodilator inhaler: beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salbutamol and terbutaline antimuscarinic inhalers, such as ipratropiumthe inhaler should be used when you feel breathless and this should relieve the symptoms.if a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler does not help relieve your symptoms, your gp may recommend a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler. this works in a similar way to a short-acting bronchodilator, but each dose lasts for at least 12 hours.there are two types of long-acting bronchodilator inhalers: beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol antimuscarinic inhalers, such as tiotropium, glycopyronium and aclidiniumsteroid inhalers, also called corticosteroid inhalers, work by reducing the inflammation in your airways.if you are still getting breathless or having flare-ups even when taking long-acting bronchodilator inhalers, your gp may suggest including a steroid inhaler as part of your treatment. most people with copd will be prescribed a steroid inhaler as part of a combination inhaler.if you are getting breathless or having flare-ups when using a combination of inhalers, your gp may prescribe theophylline tablets. theophylline causes the muscles of your airways to relax and open up.when you have been taking theophylline tablets regularly, you may need to give a blood sample to measure the amount of theophylline in your blood and help your gp prescribe the appropriate dose of tablet. this will allow you to get the correct dose of theophylline while reducing the likelihood of side effects.due to the risk of potential side effects, such as increased heart rate and headaches, other medicines, such as a bronchodilator inhaler, are usually tried before theophylline.mucolytics, such as carbocisteine, make the mucus and phlegm in your throat thinner and easier to cough up. they are particularly beneficial for people with a persistent cough with lots of thick phlegm or who have frequent or bad flare-ups.if you have a chest infection, your gp may prescribe a short course ofantibiotics.steroid tablets may also be prescribed as a short course if you have a bad flare-up. they work best if they are taken as the flare-up starts, so your gp may give you a course to keep at home. occasionally, you may have to take a longer course of steroid tablets. your gp will give you the lowest effective dose and monitor you for side effects. side effects are uncommon if steroid tablets are given for less than three weeks.read more about the medicines used in thechronic obstructive pulmonary disease medicines guide.nebulised medication can be used for severe cases of copd if other inhaler devices have not worked effectively. a compressor is a machine that administers nebulised medicine through a mouthpiece or a face mask. the medicine is in a liquid form and is converted into a fine mist. this enables a large dose of medicine to be taken in one go.you can usually choose whether to use nebulised medication with a mouthpiece or a facemask. your gp will advise you on how to use the machine correctly.if the oxygen level in your blood is low, you may be advised to have oxygen at home through nasal tubes, also called a nasal cannula, or through a mask. oxygen is not a treatment for breathlessness, but it is helpful for some patients with persistently low oxygen levels in the blood.you will probably be referred for more detailed assessment to see whether you might benefit from long-term oxygen therapy.if you are prescribed long term oxygen therapy, it must be taken for at least 15 hours a day to be effective. however, the longer you use it, the more effective it is.the tubes from the machine are long so you will be able to move around your home while you are connected. portable oxygen tanks are available if you need to use oxygen away from home.the aim of long-term oxygen therapy is to extend your life.do not smoke when you are using oxygen. the increased level of oxygen produced is highly flammable, and a lit cigarette could trigger a fire or explosion.part of the oxygen assessment is likely to consider if you may benefit from ambulatory oxygen – oxygen used when you walk or are active in other ways.if your oxygen levels are normal while you are resting, but fall when you exercise, you may not need long-term oxygen therapy alongside ambulatory oxygen therapy.read more abouthome oxygen treatment.non-invasive ventilation (niv) helps a person breathe using a portable machine connected to a mask covering the nose or face. you may receive it if you are taken to hospital because of a flare-up. you may be referred to a specialist centre to see if home niv could help you. niv is used to improve the functioning of your lungs.pulmonary rehabilitation is a programme of exercise and education designed to help people with chronic lung problems. it can increase your exercise capacity, mobility and self-confidence.pulmonary rehabilitation is based on a programme of physical exercise training tailored to your needs. it usually involves walking or cycling, and arm and strength-building exercises. it also includes education about your disease for you and your family, dietary assessment and advice, and psychological, social and behavioural changes designed to help you cope better.a rehabilitation programme is provided by a multidisciplinary team, which includes physiotherapists, respiratory nurse specialists and dietitians.pulmonary rehabilitation takes place in a group and the course usually lasts for about six weeks. during the course, you will learn more about your copd and how to control your symptoms.pulmonary rehabilitation

insulin.people with chronic pancreatitis also have an increased risk of developingpancreatic cancer.read more about the possiblecomplications of chronic pancreatitis.the most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain. eventually, there may also be digestion problems.the pain usually develops in the middle or left side of the abdomen and can sometimes travel along your back. it’s been described as a burning or shooting pain which comes and goes, but can last for several hours or days, in some cases.some people also experience symptoms ofnausea and vomitingduring the pain. as chronic pancreatitis progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe.although the pain sometimes occurs after eating a meal, there’s often no trigger.eventually, a constant mild to moderate pain can develop in the abdomen in between episodes of severe pain. this is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.some people whostop drinking alcoholandstop smokingmay experience a reduction in the severity of their pain.additional symptoms can occur when the pancreas loses its ability to produce digestive juices, which help to break down food in the digestive system. the pancreas usually only loses these functions many years after the original symptoms started.the absence of digestive juices makes it difficult for your digestive system to break down fats and certain proteins. this can cause your stools to become particularly smelly and greasy, and make them difficult to flush down the toilet.you may also experience: weight loss loss of appetite jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) symptoms ofdiabetes– such as feeling very thirsty, urinating frequently and

also have other conditions caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue. these includeulcerative colitisorcrohn’s disease, both of which cause inflammation inside the digestive system.some cases of chronic pancreatitis are inherited. this is thought to be caused by mutations (alterations) in a number of genes, including genes called prss1 and spink-1. these mutations disrupt the normal working of the pancreas.genetic mutations may also have a role in the effect of alcohol on your pancreas. evidence suggests that certain genetic mutations make the pancreas more vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol.certain mutations of the cftr gene, responsible forcystic fibrosis, are also thought to cause chronic pancreatitis in a small amount of cases.several other rare causes of chronic pancreatitis have also been identified, including: injury to the pancreas blocked or narrowed openings (ducts) of the pancreas smoking radiotherapyto the abdomen (tummy)chronic pancreatitis can usually only be diagnosed by carrying out scans of the pancreas.your gp will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a simple physical examination, but they’ll refer you for further tests if they suspect chronic pancreatitis.these tests are usually carried out in your local hospital and may include: requesting a stool sample anultrasound scan– where sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your pancreas acomputerised tomography (ct) scan– where a series of x-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional image of the pancreas an endoscopic ultrasonography a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or mrcpduring an endoscopic ultrasonography, a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. an ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope is able to get close to the pancreas and take very accurate pictures of it.you’ll usually be given a sedative to help you relax during the procedure.an mrcp involves injecting you with a substance known as a contrast agent that makes your pancreas and surrounding organs, such as the gallbladder and liver, show up very clearly on amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanner.an mri scanner is a type of imaging system that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to build up a detailed image of the inside of your body.an mrcp is a useful way of checking whethergallstonesmay be contributing to your symptoms.sometimes, the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis can be very similar topancreatic cancer. therefore, if you have symptoms such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) and weight loss, a biopsy may be recommended to rule out a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.abiopsyinvolves taking a small sample of cells from the pancreas and sending it to a laboratory, so it can be checked under a microscope for the presence of cancerous cells.a biopsy can be taken using a long, thin needle that’s passed through your abdomen. the needle can be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound scan or ct scan. alternatively, a biopsy can be taken during an endoscopic ultrasonography.treatment for chronic pancreatitis aims to help control the condition and reduce any symptoms.if you’re diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, some lifestyle changes will be recommended.the most important thing you can do is to stop drinking alcohol, even if it isn’t the cause of your condition. this helps to prevent further damage to your pancreas and may help to reduce the pain.if you continue to drink alcohol, it’s likely that you’ll experience debilitating pain and you’ll be more likely to die from acomplication of chronic pancreatitis.some people with chronic pancreatitis caused by alcohol consumption have a dependency on alcohol and require additional help and support to stop drinking. if this applies to you, talk to your gp about getting help to stop drinking.treatment options for alcohol dependence include: one-to-one counselling self-help groups – such asalcoholics anonymous a medication called acamprosate that can help to reduce cravings for alcoholread more abouttreating alcohol misuse.if you smoke, you should stop. smoking can speed up the progress of chronic pancreatitis, making it more likely that your pancreas will lose its function.it’s recommended that you use an anti-smoking treatment, such as nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) or bupropion (a medication used to reduce cravings for cigarettes). people who use these types of treatments have a much greater success rate in permanently stopping smoking than those who try to quit using willpower alone.if you want to give up smoking, it’s a good idea to start by visiting your gp. they’ll be able to give you help and advice about quitting and can refer you to an nhs stop smoking support service.these services offer the best support for people who want to give up smoking. studies show you are 4 times more likely to give up smoking if you do it through the nhs.read more aboutstopping smoking.as chronic pancreatitis can affect your ability to digest certain foods, you may need to change your diet.your gp may be able to provide you with appropriate dietary advice, or may refer you to a dietitian, who will draw up a suitable dietary plan.a low-fat, high-protein, high-calorie diet with fat-soluble vitamin supplements is usually recommended, but don’t make changes to your diet without consulting a health professional.you may be given pancreatic enzyme supplements, which is medication containing an artificial version of the enzymes produced by your pancreas. these supplements may help to improve the effectiveness of your digestive system.side effects of pancreatic enzyme supplements can includediarrhoea,constipation, nausea, vomiting and stomach pains.talk to your gp if you’re experiencing troublesome side effects, as your dosage may need to be adjusted.if you have chronic pancreatitis caused by problems with your immune system, treatment is relatively straightforward. the inflammation affecting the pancreas can usually be relieved using steroid medication (corticosteroids).however, taking corticosteroids for a long time can cause side effects, such asosteoporosisand weight gain.pain relief is an important part of the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. at first, mild painkillers will be used, but more powerful ones will be needed if these don’t work.in most cases, the first painkiller used isparacetamolor anon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid), such asibuprofen.taking nsaids on a long-term basis can increase your risk of developingstomach ulcers, so you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) to protect against this.if nsaids or paracetamol prove to be ineffective in controlling your pain, it’s likely that you’ll need an opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol. side effects of these types of medication can include constipation, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness.the side effect of constipation can be particularly troublesome if you need to take an opiate-based painkiller on a long-term basis. you may be prescribed a laxative to help relieve your constipation.see the page ontreating constipationfor more information.if you feel drowsy after taking an opiate-based painkiller, avoid driving and using heavy tools or machines.if you experience an attack of very severe pain, you may need a stronger opiate-based painkiller, such as morphine or pethidine. these have similar side effects to opiate-based painkillers.long-term use of these stronger opiate-based painkillers isn’t usually recommended, because there’s a high risk of addiction. therefore, if you have persistent severe pain, surgery is usually recommended.in some cases, an additional medication called amitriptyline may be recommended. amitriptyline was originally designed to treat depression, but it can help to relieve pain in some people.if medication isn’t effective, severe pain can sometimes be temporarily relieved for a few weeks or months using a procedure called a nerve block. this is an injection that blocks the pain signals from the pancreas.if the inflammation of your pancreas suddenly gets worse, you may need a short stay in hospital for treatment.this may involve having fluids delivered directly into a vein, and oxygen supplied through tubes into your nose.read more abouttreating acute pancreatitis.surgery can be used to treat severe pain in people with chronic pancreatitis. depending on the exact cause of your pain, there are a variety of surgical techniques that may be used.patients with stones in the opening of their pancreas (the pancreatic duct) may benefit from endoscopic surgery and a treatment called lithotripsy.lithotripsy involves using shock waves to break the stone into smaller pieces. an endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light source and a video camera at one end) is then used to pass surgical instruments into the pancreatic duct so the pieces can be removed.this treatment may improve pain to some extent, but the benefit may not be permanent.in cases where specific parts of the pancreas are inflamed and causing severe pain, these parts can be surgically removed. this type of surgery is called a pancreas resection.pancreas resection can also be used if endoscopic treatment is ineffective.the technique used for pancreas resection depends on exactly which parts need to be removed. for example, some techniques involve removing the gallbladder, along with parts of the pancreas.the different surgical techniques tend to have the same levels of effectiveness in terms of reducing pain and preserving the function of the pancreas, although some of the more complex techniques have an increased risk of complications, such as infection and internal bleeding. simpler procedures have a lower risk of complications and usually have faster recovery times.discuss the pros and cons of the appropriate pancreas resection techniques with your surgical team before making a decision.in the most serious cases of chronic pancreatitis, where the pancreas has been extensively damaged, it may be necessary to remove the entire pancreas. this is known as a total pancreatectomy.a total pancreatectomy can be very effective in treating pain. however, you’ll no longer be able to produce the insulin that’s needed by your body. to overcome this problem, a relatively new technique called autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation (apict) is sometimes used.during apict, the islet cells responsible for producing insulin are removed from your pancreas, before your pancreas is surgically removed.the islet cells are mixed with a special solution, which is injected into your liver. if the apict procedure is successful, the islet cells remain in your liver and begin to produce insulin.in the short term, apict appears to be effective, but you may need additional insulin treatment in the long term. see guidelines from thenational institute for health and care excellence(nice) aboutautologous pancreatic islet cell transplantationfor more information.complications of chronic pancreatitis are relatively common and usually caused by living with chronic pain or damage to the pancreas.any chronic health condition, particularly one causing recurring or constant pain, can have an adverse effect on your emotional and psychological health. the international association for the study of pain found that up to 94% of people with chronic pancreatitis experience pain.one study of people living with chronic pancreatitis found that one in seven people had some sort of psychological or emotional problem, such asstress,anxietyordepression.contact your gp if you’re experiencing psychological and emotional difficulties. effective treatments are available to help improve the symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.joining a support group for people with chronic pancreatitis may also help. talking to other people with the same condition can often help to reduce feelings of isolation and stress.around a third of people with chronic pancreatitis developdiabetes, usually many years after receiving their diagnosis (it’s not unusual for 20 years to pass before diabetes occurs).diabetes develops when your pancreas is no longer able to produce insulin (a chemical the body uses to break glucose down into energy). the main symptoms of diabetes are: feeling very thirsty going to the toilet a lot, particularly at night extreme tiredness weight loss and muscle wasting (loss of muscle bulk)if you develop diabetes because of chronic pancreatitis, you’ll probably need to have regular insulin injections to compensate for the lack of natural insulin in your body.another common complication of chronic pancreatitis is pseudocysts (sacs of fluid which develop on the surface of your pancreas). they’re thought to affect around 1 in 10 people with chronic pancreatitis.in many cases, pseudocysts don’t cause any symptoms and are only detected during acomputerised tomography (ct) scan. however, in some people, pseudocysts can cause the following symptoms: bloating indigestion dull abdominal painif the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for treatment, because they usually disappear on their own.treatment is usually recommended if you’re experiencing symptoms or the pseudocysts are larger than 6cm (2.3 inches) in diameter. larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting open, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection.pseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst. this can be done by inserting a needle through your skin and into the cyst. alternatively, an endoscopy may be used. this is where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid.sometimes, pseudocysts are treated by removing part of the pancreas using laparoscopic or ‘keyhole’ surgery. this is known as a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. see guidelines from the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) onlaparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.chronic pancreatitis increases your risk of developingpancreatic cancer. however, the increased risk is relatively small. for example, it’s estimated that for every 100 people with chronic pancreatitis, only 1 or 2 will develop pancreatic cancer.the most common initial symptoms of pancreatic cancer are much the same as chronic pancreatitis. they include jaundice, abdominal pain and weight loss. acute pancreatitis nice: autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation for improved glycaemic control

       " 'Cirrhosis': 'cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by continuous, long-term liver damage.scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.the damage caused by cirrhosis can’t be reversed and can eventually become so extensive that your liver stops functioning. this is called liver failure.cirrhosis can be fatal if the liver fails. however, it usually takes years for the condition to reach this stage and treatment can help slow its progression.each year in the uk, around 4,000 people die from cirrhosis and 700 people with the condition need aliver transplantto survive.there are usually few symptoms in the early stages of cirrhosis. however, as your liver loses its ability to function properly, you’re likely to experience a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin.in the later stages, symptoms can include jaundice, vomiting blood, dark, tarry-looking stools, and a build-up of fluid in the legs (oedema) and abdomen (ascites).read more about the symptoms of cirrhosis.as cirrhosis doesn’t have many obvious symptoms during the early stages, it’s often picked up during tests for an unrelated illness.see your gp if you have any of the following symptoms: fever and shivering shortness of breath vomiting blood very dark or black, tarry stools (faeces) periods of confusion or drowsinessread more aboutdiagnosing cirrhosis.in the uk, the most common causes of cirrhosis are: drinking too much alcohol (alcohol misuse) over many years being infected with thehepatitis cvirus for a long time a condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) that causes excess fat to build up in the livernash is on the rise in the uk, due to increasing levels ofobesityand reduced physical activity. it’s likely that it will overtake

noticeable problems tend to develop as the liver becomes more damaged.in early stage cirrhosis, the liver is able to function properly despite being damaged. as the condition progresses, symptoms tend to develop when functions of the liver are affected.symptoms of cirrhosis can include: tiredness and weakness loss of appetite weight loss and muscle wasting feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting tenderness or pain around the liver area tiny red lines (blood capillaries) on the skin above waist level very itchy skin yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) a tendency to

your abdomen (tummy), due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites (severe cases can make you look heavily pregnant)you may also notice changes in your personality, problems sleeping (insomnia), memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating. this is known as encephalopathy and occurs when toxins affect your brain because your liver is unable to remove them from your body.in the later stages of cirrhosis, you may vomit blood or have tarry, black stools. this is because blood can’t flow through the liver properly, which causes an increase in blood pressure in the vein that carries blood from the gut to the liver (portal vein).the increase in blood pressure forces blood through smaller, fragile vessels that line your stomach and gullet (varices). these can burst under high blood pressure, leading to internal bleeding, which is visible in vomit and/or stools.over time, the toxins that would normally be removed from the body by a healthy liver can cause multiple organ failure, followed by death.you should see your gp if you have persistent signs and symptoms of cirrhosis.seek immediate medical help if you develop the following symptoms, particularly if you’ve been previously diagnosed with cirrhosis: fever and shivering attacks shortness of breath vomiting blood very dark or black tarry stools periods of mental confusion or drowsinessthere are many different causes of cirrhosis. in the uk, the most common causes are drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and long-term hepatitis c infections.in some cases, no specific cause is identified.the liver breaks down toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, but too much alcohol can scar and damage the liver’s cells. men and women who drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week are considered to be drinking too much.if you’re a heavy drinker, your chances of developing cirrhosis are increased. however, it’s important to realise that cirrhosis of the liver isn’t just a condition that affects people dependent on alcohol. if you’re a heavy social drinker, you can also develop cirrhosis.alcohol-related cirrhosis usually develops after 10 or more years of heavy drinking. for unknown reasons, some people are more susceptible to liver cell damage than others. women who drink heavily are more susceptible to liver damage than men, partly because of their different body size and build.people who drink excessively and continue to drink heavily develop cirrhosis in 3 separate stages.the first stage ofalcohol-related liver diseaseis known as ‘fatty liver’, which almost all excessive drinkers develop. it’s a side effect of the liver breaking alcohol down and disappears when you drink less.the second stage of alcohol-related liver disease is alcoholic hepatitis. around 20% to 30% of people who continue to drink heavily develop alcoholic hepatitis. during this stage, the liver becomes inflamed. if alcoholic hepatitis deteriorates into its most extreme form (liver failure) it can lead to death.about 10% of heavy drinkers develop cirrhosis, which is the third stage of alcohol-related liver disease.this risk of developing cirrhosis, along with the risk of alcoholic hepatitis, is one of the main reasons the government recommends that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. if you do drink as much as 14 units a week, it is advised that you spread your drinking over 3 or more days.a unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. a small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units.read more aboutalcohol units.your gp can give you help and advice if you’re finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink.hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. left untreated, it can damage the liver over many years, eventually resulting in cirrhosis.in the uk,hepatitis cis the most common form of hepatitis. the hepatitis c virus is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, most commonly by sharing needles used to inject drugs.two other types of hepatitis infection,hepatitis band d, can also cause cirrhosis.non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) is a severe liver condition that can lead to cirrhosis. as with alcohol-related liver disease, the early stage of nash is the build-up of excess fat in the liver. this fat is associated with inflammation and scarring, which could lead to cirrhosis.nash can develop in people who are obese, havediabetes, have high levels of fat in the blood (high cholesterol) andhigh blood pressure. most people with nash feel well and aren’t aware they have a problem until cirrhosis occurs and liver function is affected.nash is on the rise in the uk due to increasing levels ofobesityand reduced physical activity. it’s likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis c as the most common cause of cirrhosis.there are a number of other conditions that can prevent the liver functioning healthily and can lead to cirrhosis. these include: autoimmune liver disease – the immune system usually makes antibodies to attack bacteria and viruses; however, if you have an autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc), your immune system will make antibodies that attack healthy organs some rare, genetic conditions – such as haemochromatosis (a build-up of iron in the liver and other parts of the body) and wilson’s disease (a build-up of copper in the liver and other parts of the body) any condition that causes the bile ducts to become blocked – such ascancer of the bile ductsorpancreatic cancer budd-chiari syndrome – caused by blood clots blocking the veins that carry blood from the liverless commonly, the use of certain medications, such as amiodarone and methotrexate, can also cause cirrhosis.if your gp suspects cirrhosis, they’ll check your medical history and carry out a physical examination to look for signs of chronic liver disease.if your gp suspects your liver is damaged, you’ll be referred for tests to confirm the diagnosis.you may have a number of different tests.blood testscan measure your liver function and the amount of liver damage. a blood test may be used to measure the levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase (alt) and aspartate transferase (ast) in your blood, as these will be raised if you have inflammation of the liver (hepatitis).anultrasound scan, transient elastography scan,computerised tomography (ct)scan or amagnetic resonance imaging (mri)scan may be carried out on your liver. a transient elastography scan is similar to an ultrasound scan carried out during pregnancy (it’s sometimes known as a fibroscan).these scans can produce detailed images of your liver or check liver stiffness to identify any scarring.thelab tests online ukwebsite has more information aboutaltandastmeasurements.a liverbiopsyis where a fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs) to remove a small sample of liver cells. the sample is sent to a laboratory so it can be examined under a microscope.the biopsy is usually carried out underlocal anaesthetic, as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. the outcome of the biopsy will confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis and may provide more information about the cause. however, transient elastography is increasingly being used as an alternative to a biopsy in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.an endoscopy is where an endoscope (a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end) is passed down your throat and into your stomach.images of your oesophagus (tube from your throat to your stomach) and stomach are transmitted to an external screen where any varices (swollen vessels), which are a sign of cirrhosis, can be seen.there are several different grading systems for cirrhosis according to how serious it is. one system is the child-pugh score which, based on your examination and laboratory tests, grades cirrhosis from a (relatively mild) to c (severe).an alternative system called model of end-stage liver disease (meld) uses the results of a blood test to help identify people who need an urgent liver transplant.cirrhosis can’t be cured, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and any complications and stop the condition getting worse.it’s usually not possible to reverse liver damage that’s already occurred, although recent research suggests this may eventually be possible in cases where the underlying cause of the liver damage can be successfully treated.treatment is likely to take place at a hospital with a specialist hepatology unit, which treats disorders of the liver, gall bladder and biliary ducts.taking medication to treat the underlying cause of the liver damage and making healthy lifestyle changes can help stop cirrhosis getting worse and reduce your risk of developing further health problems.the medication you need will depend on the specific cause of the damage to your liver.for example, if you have viral hepatitis you may be prescribed anti-viral medications. if you have autoimmune hepatitis you may be given steroid medication (corticosteroids) or medication to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants).there are a number of things you can do to help yourself stay healthy and reduce your chances of developing further problems if you have cirrhosis, including: completely avoidalcohol, regardless of the cause of your cirrhosis, as alcohol consumption increases the rate at which the condition progresses lose weightif you’re overweight or obese regularexerciseto reduce muscle wasting practise good hygiene to reduce your chances of developing infections speak to your gp aboutvaccinationsyou may need, such as theannual flu vaccineor travel vaccines speak to your gp or pharmacist if you’re taking over-the-counter or prescription medications, as cirrhosis can affect the way your body processes some medicinesmalnutritionis common in people with cirrhosis, so it’s important to ensure you have abalanced dietto help you get all the nutrients you need.avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can help reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build up of fluid. see tips for a lower salt diet for more information.the damage to your liver can also mean it’s unable to store glycogen, a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. when this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. therefore, you may need extra calories and protein in your diet.healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. it may also be helpful to eat 3 or 4 small meals a day, rather than 1 or 2 large meals.a number of treatments can ease the symptoms of cirrhosis, including: a low-sodium (salt) diet or tablets called diuretics to reduce the amount of fluid in your body tablets to reduce high blood pressure in your portal vein (the main vein that transports blood from the gut to the liver) and prevent or treat any infection creams to reduce itchingin cases of advanced cirrhosis, complications caused by the condition may need treatment.if you vomit blood or pass blood in your stools, you probably have swollen veins in your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). these are known as oesophageal varices.in these cases, urgent medical attention is required. this means seeing your gp or going to the accident and emergency (a&e) department of your nearest hospital immediately.certain procedures can help stop the bleeding and reduce the risk of it happening again, such as: banding – an endoscopy is carried out (a thin, flexible tube is passed down your throat) and a small band is placed around the base of the varices to help control the bleeding injection glue therapy – following an endoscopy, a type of medical ‘super glue’ is injected into the varices to make the blood clot, which helps to stop the bleeding a sengstaken tube with a balloon on the end – a special tube is passed down your throat into your stomach and the balloon is inflated; this puts pressure on the varices and helps stop the bleeding and you’ll be heavily sedated during the procedure a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (tipss) – a metal tube called a stent is passed across your liver to join 2 large veins (the portal vein and hepatic vein); this creates a new route for your blood to flow through, therefore relieving the pressure that causes the varicesyou may also be given a type of medication called abeta-blocker, such as propanolol, to reduce the risk of bleeding or reduce the severity of any bleed that does occur.ascites (a build-up of fluid around your stomach area) and peripheral oedema (fluid around your legs and ankles) are common complications of advanced cirrhosis. they’ll need to be addressed as soon as possible.you may have 20 to 30 litres of free water in your stomach area (abdomen), which can make it difficult for you to eat and breathe properly. the main treatments for ascites and oedema are restricting sodium (salt) in your diet and taking diuretic tablets, such as spironolactone or furosemide.if the fluid around your stomach becomes infected, you may need to be treated withantibiotics. alternatively, antibiotics may be used on a regular basis to prevent infection in people at high risk.in severe cases of ascites, tubes may be used to drain the fluid from your abdomen. this will usually be repeated every few weeks.people with cirrhosis can sometimes develop problems with their brain function (encephalopathy). this occurs because the liver isn’t clearing toxins properly.the main treatment for encephalopathy is lactulose syrup. this acts as alaxative(it helps clear the bowels) and helps the body remove the toxins that build up in the body when the liver is failing. in some cases, other laxatives or an enema may be used.cirrhosis can affect the liver’s ability to make the blood clot (thicken), leaving you at risk of severe bleeding if you cut yourself.vitamin kand a blood product called plasma can be given in emergencies to treat episodes of bleeding. you’ll need to apply pressure to any cuts that bleed.therefore, you should seek specialist advice before having medical procedures, including any dental work.your liver may stop functioning if it’s severely damaged by scarring. in this situation, aliver transplantis the only option. this is a major procedure that involves removing your diseased liver and replacing it with a healthy donor liver.however, you’ll probably have to wait a long time for a liver transplant because there are more people waiting for a transplant than there are donors.thenhsbt organ donationwebsite has more information about transplants and joining theorgan donor register.you can reduce your chances of developing cirrhosis by limiting your alcohol consumption and protecting yourself from a hepatitis infection.heavy alcohol consumption is one of the most common causes of cirrhosis of the liver. one of the best ways to avoid this is to keep within recommended limits. men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a weekif you have cirrhosis, you should stop drinking alcohol immediately because it speeds up the rate at which the condition progresses, regardless of the cause.read

drugs.using acondomwhen having sex will help you avoid the risk of getting hepatitis, as will avoiding injecting drugs.anyone who’s at risk of getting hepatitis b, such as police officers and social care workers, can be protected by being vaccinated against the condition. however, there’s currently no vaccine forhepatitis c.people born in areas of the world where hepatitis b and c are widespread,

with another course of antibiotics.symptoms of a c. difficile infection usually develop when you’re taking antibiotics, or when you’ve finished taking them within the last few weeks.the most common symptoms are:in some cases, serious complications can develop, such as damage to the bowel or severe dehydration, which may cause drowsiness, confusion, a rapid heart rate and fainting.c. difficile

you may need tests or scans in hospital to check if your bowel is damaged.your gp will decide whether you need hospital treatment (if you’re not already in hospital). if the infection is relatively mild, you may be treated at home.if you’re in hospital, you might be moved to a room of your own during treatment to reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.treatment for c. difficile can include: stopping the antibiotics thought to be causing the infection, if possible – in mild cases, this may be the only treatment that’s needed taking a 10 to 14-day course of antibiotics that are known to kill c. difficile bacteria rarely, serious infections may require surgery to remove a damaged section of the bowelc. difficile infections usually respond well to treatment, with most people making a full recovery in a week or two. however, the symptoms come back in around 1 in 5 cases and treatment may need to be repeated.if you’re well enough to be treated at home, the following measures can help relieve your symptoms and prevent the infection spreading. make sure you finish the entire course of any antibiotics you’re prescribed, even if you’re feeling better drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration and eat plain foods such as soup, rice, pasta and bread if you feel hungry take paracetamol for tummy pain or a fever regularly wash your hands and contaminated surfaces, objects or sheets stay at home until at least 48 hours after your last episode of diarrhoea do not take anti-diarrhoeal medication, as this can stop the infection being cleared from your bodyyour gp may contact you regularly to make sure you’re getting better. phone them if your symptoms return after treatment finishes, as it may need to be repeated.c. difficile bacteria are found in the digestive system of about 1 in every 30 healthy adults. the bacteria often live harmlessly because the other bacteria normally found in the bowel keep it under control.however, some antibiotics can interfere with the balance of bacteria in the bowel, which can cause the c. difficile bacteria to multiply and produce toxins that make the person ill.when this happens, c. difficile can spread easily to other people because the bacteria are passed out of the body in the person’s diarrhoea.once out of the body, the bacteria turn into resistant cells called spores. these can survive for long periods on hands, surfaces (such as toilets), objects and clothing unless they’re thoroughly cleaned, and can infect someone else if they get into their mouth.someone with a c. difficile infection is generally considered to be infectious until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared up.c. difficile infections can be passed on very easily. you can reduce your risk of picking it up or spreading it by practising good hygiene, both at home and in healthcare settings.the following measures can help: stay at home until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared up wash your hands regularly with soap and water, particularly after going to the toilet and before eating – use liquid rather than bar soap and don’t use flannels or nail brushes clean contaminated surfaces – such as the toilet, flush handle, light switches and door handles – with a bleach-based cleaner after each use don’t share towels and flannels wash contaminated clothes and sheets separately from other washing at the highest possible temperature when visiting someone in hospital, observe any visiting guidelines, avoid taking any children under the age of 12, and wash your hands with liquid soap and water when entering and leaving ward areas – don’t rely on alcohol hand gels, as they’re not effective against c. difficile avoid visiting hospital if you’re feeling unwell or have recently

the bones to become brittle, weak and fracture more easily. bones need a wide variety of vitamins and minerals to stay dense and strong.if you’ve coeliac disease, you’ve an increased risk of developing osteoporosis due to the damaged gut failing to absorb key bone nutrients from food. this decreases blood vitamin and mineral levels and the body compensates for this by taking nutrients like calcium from the bones. this weakens your bones and puts you at increased risk of fracture.if you have coeliac disease, you should make sure you’re eating enough calcium and take vitamin d

burning sensation around your mouth. small fluid-filled sores then appear, usually on the edges of your lower lip.read more about thesymptoms of cold sores.if you have cold sores you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. find your local pharmacy on scotland’s service directory.cold sores aren’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your gp practice if required.if you’ve had outbreaks of cold sores before, it’s likely that you’ll know what they are if they return.you only need to visit your pharmacist if you’re unsure whether it’s a cold sore or if it’s severe and spreading further than just the lip. see your pharmacist if a cold sore hasn’t healed after 7 to 10 days.the strain of herpes simplex virus usually responsible for cold sores is known as hsv-1.in rare cases, cold sores can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2). this can be the result of having oral sex with someone who hasgenital herpes.read more about thecauses of cold sores.the herpes simplex virus – or ‘cold sore virus’ – is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. after someone has contracted the virus, it remains inactive (dormant) most of the time.however, every so often the virus can be activated by certain triggers, resulting in an outbreak of cold sores. these triggers vary from person to person, but can include sunlight, fatigue, an injury to the affected area, and, in women, their period.some people have frequently recurring cold sores around two or three times a year, while others have one cold sore and never have another. some people never get cold sores at all because the virus never becomes active.cold sores usually clear up by themselves without treatment within 7 to 10 days.however, antiviral creams are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. if used correctly, these can help ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time.to be effective, these treatments should be applied as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear – when you feel a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much of an effect.cold sore patches are also available that contain hydrocolloid gel, which is an effective treatment for skin wounds. the patch is placed over the cold sore while it heals.antiviral tablets may be prescribed for severe cases.read more abouttreating cold sores.cold sores are usually mild, but may cause complications in rare cases. people with weak immune systems caused by illness or treatments such as chemotherapy are particularly at risk of complications.dehydrationsometimes occurs if drinking fluids becomes painful. young children are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated.the herpes simplex virus can also spread to other parts of your body. examples of when this can occur include: skin infections – these often occur if the virus comes into contact with broken skin, such as acut or graze, or a skin condition such aseczema herpetic whitlow (whitlow finger) – this causes painful sores and blisters to appear on and around your fingers herpetic keratoconjunctivitis – this causes swelling and irritation (inflammation) of your eye area and sores to develop on your eyelidsleft untreated, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis can cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of your eye, to become infected, which can eventually lead to blindness.it’s therefore important not to touch your eyes if you have an unhealed cold sore. if you must touch your eyes – for example, to remove contact lenses – wash your hands thoroughly first.in very rare cases, encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes inflamed and swollen, can be caused by the cold sore virus spreading to the brain. it can be treated with intravenous injections of antiviral medications, such as aciclovir.it’s not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores, but you can take steps to minimise the spread of infection.cold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), but remain contagious until they’re completely healed. avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared.however, there’s no need to stay away from work or miss school if you or your child have a cold sore.you can help minimise the risk of the cold sore virus spreading and cold sores recurring by following the advice below: avoid touching cold sores unless you’re applying cold sore cream – creams should be dabbed on gently rather than rubbed in, as this can damage your skin further always wash your hands before and after applying cold sore cream and after touching the affected area do not share cold sore creams or medication with other people as this can cause the infection to spread do not share items that come into contact with the affected area, such as lipsticks or cutlery avoid kissing and oral sex until your cold sores have completely healed be particularly careful around newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a low immune system, such as those withhivor those havingchemotherapy if you know what usually triggers your cold sores, try to avoid the triggers – for example, a sun block lip balm (spf 15 or higher) may help prevent cold sores triggered by bright sunlightyou won’t usually have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus (the primary infection).an outbreak of cold sores may occur some time later and keep coming back (recurrent infection).however, if the primary infection does cause symptoms, they can be quite severe.symptoms of the primary infection are most likely to develop in children younger than 5 years old. symptoms include: swollen and irritated gums with small, painful sores in and around the mouth – this is known as herpes simplex gingivostomatitis sore throatand swollen glands producing more saliva than normal high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above dehydration feeling sick (nausea) headachesherpes simplex gingivostomatitis usually affects young children, but adults can also develop it. it can last 7 to 14 days, with the sores taking up to 3 weeks to heal. however, gingivostomatitis doesn’t usually recur after the primary infection.primary herpes simplex viruses are rare in adults, but the symptoms are similar to those experienced by children.you’ll usually have a sore throat with or without swollen glands. you may also have bad breath (halitosis) and painful sores in and around your mouth. these can develop intoulcerswith grey or yellow centres.if you develop the herpes simplex virus at an early age, it may be triggered periodically in later life and can cause recurring bouts of cold sores. after the primary infection, the symptoms are usually reduced to just the cold sores themselves.recurrent infections usually last for less time and are less severe than the primary infection. the only symptom is an outbreak of cold sores, although you may also have swollen glands.an outbreak of cold sores usually starts with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. small fluid-filled sores then develop, usually on the edges of your lower lip.if you have frequent recurrent infections, you may develop cold sores in the same place every time. they may grow in size and cause irritation and pain. initially, they may ooze before crusting or scabbing over within 48 hours of the initial tingling sensation.if the cold sores are very troublesome, it’s possible to suppress them by taking an antiviral tablet called acyclovir regularly, every day for a few months. this is usually only recommended if cold sores are causing a lot of problems, and they may come back when treatment is stopped.most cold sores disappear within 7 to 10 days without treatment and usually heal without scarring.cold sores are usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1).in most cases the virus is passed on in early childhood – for example, when a child is kissed by a family member or friend with a cold sore.the virus passes through the skin and travels up the nerves, where it lies inactive (dormant) until it’s triggered at a later date.factors thought to trigger outbreaks of cold sores include: having another infection, such as a respiratory tract infection having a high temperature (fever) emotional upset or psychologicalstress tiredness and fatigue an injury to the affected area menstruation (periods) strong sunlighthowever, in many cases there’s no obvious trigger for an outbreak.occasionally, cold sores can be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2).this can happen after having oral sex with a man or woman who hasgenital herpes, which is usually caused by hsv-2.in genital herpes, painful blisters develop on your genitals and the surrounding area.cold sores usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days. antiviral tablets or cream can be used to ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time.if you develop a cold sore, some general advice to follow includes: drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration avoid acidic or salty foods and eat cool, soft foods if brushing your teeth is painful, use an antiseptic mouthwash dab creams on to sores rather than rubbing them in wash your hands using soap and water before and after applying cold sore creams avoid touching your cold sores, other than to apply cream, and don’t share your cold sore cream with othersantiviral creams such as aciclovir or penciclovir (also known as fenistil®) may speed up the healing time of a recurrent cold sore infection if used correctly.cold sore creams are widely available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription.they’re only effective if you apply them as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear, when the herpes simplex virus is spreading and replicating. using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much effect.if you have frequently recurring bouts of cold sores, use antiviral medication as soon as you feel the tingling sensation that indicates a cold sore is about to develop. you’ll need to apply the cream up to 5 times a day for 4 to 5 days.antiviral creams can only help to heal a current outbreak of cold sores. they don’t get rid of the herpes simplex virus or prevent future outbreaks of cold sores occurring.antiviral tablets are generally more effective than creams at treating cold sores, but are usually only prescribed for more severe cases.cold sore patches that contain a special gel called hydrocolloid are also available. they’re an effective treatment for skin wounds and are placed over the cold sore to hide the sore area while it heals.several non-antiviral creams are also available over the counter from pharmacies without the need for a prescription.these creams aren’t specifically designed to treat cold sores and won’t help them heal faster, but they may help ease any pain or irritation. ask your pharmacist to recommend a suitable treatment for you.pain can also be treated with painkillers such asibuprofenorparacetamol– both are available in liquid form for young children.however, don’t take ibuprofen if you haveasthmaorstomach ulcers, or you’ve had them in the past.children under the age of 16 shouldn’t be given aspirin.speak to your pharmacist if you have cold sores and you’re pregnant.if your cold sores are particularly severe or your immune system is damaged – for example, if you havehivor you’re havingchemotherapytreatment – you may be at risk of developing serious complications.for example, your risk of developing encephalitis or the infection spreading to other parts of your body, such as your eyes, is increased.speak to your gp if you’re at risk. they may prescribe antiviral tablets and refer you for specialist treatment.the type of treatment recommended will depend on the severity of your cold sore symptoms and the complication that’s causing problems.for example, if you develop herpetic keratoconjunctivitis – a secondary eye infection – you may need to see an ophthalmologist, a specialist eye doctor.visit your pharmacist if you or your child develops swollen, painful gums (gingivostomatitis) as a result of the primary herpes simplex infection. they’ll be able to suggest treatments to help ease your symptoms.if the infection is painful, your pharmacist may suggest using a preparation that contains benzydamine, which is available as an oral rinse or oral spray, to help relieve any pain in your mouth or throat.brushing your teeth may also be painful because of the swelling of your gums. your pharmacist may suggest using an antiseptic mouthwash. this helps prevent secondary infections and will also control a build-up of plaque if you can’t brush your teeth effectively.as with the treatment of cold sores, any pain or fever can be treated using ibuprofen or paracetamol.in rare cases of gingivostomatitis, it’s possible for your lips to become stuck together in places. using a lip barrier cream available from your local pharmacist will help prevent this.if you or your child has gingivostomatitis, it’s important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. young children are particularly at risk as they may refuse to eat or drink because of the pain in their mouth.it’s important to watch out for signs ofdehydration, such as: headaches tiredness irritability lightheadedness low urine outputmost cases of gingivostomatitis get better in 7 to 14 days, although it may take up to 3 weeks for the sores to heal completely.if you or your child still has symptoms of gingivostomatitis after 2 weeks or the infection is severe your pharmacist may advise you to contact your gp, who may refer you for specialist treatment.specialist referral may also be needed for gingivostomatitis if you’re pregnant or have a weakened immune system.visit your gp if you have a newborn baby who develops gingivostomatitis, as they may also need to

       " 'Coma': 'a coma is a state of unconsciousness where a person is unresponsive and cannot be woken.it can result from injury to the brain, such as asevere head injuryorstroke. a coma can also be caused by severe alcohol poisoning or a brain infection (encephalitis).people withdiabetescould fall into a coma if their blood glucose levels suddenly became very low(hypoglycaemia)or very high(hyperglycaemia).someone who is in a coma is unconscious and has minimal brain activity. they’re alive, but can’t be woken up and show no signs of being aware.the person’s eyes will be closed and they’ll appear to be unresponsive to their environment. they won’t normally respond to sound or pain, or be able to communicate or move voluntarily.someone in a coma will also have very reduced basic reflexes such as coughing and swallowing. they may be able to breathe on their own, although some people require a machine to help them breathe.over time, the person may start to gradually regain consciousness and become more aware. some people will wake up after a few weeks, while others may go into a vegetative state or minimally conscious state.doctors assess a person’s level of consciousness using a tool called theglasgow coma scale. this level is monitored constantly for signs of improvement or deterioration. the glasgow coma scale assesses three things:most people in a coma will have a total score of eight or less. a lower score means someone may have experienced more severe brain damage and could be less likely to recover.in the short term, a person in a coma will normally be looked after in an intensive care unit (icu). treatment involves ensuring their condition is stable and their body functions, such as breathing and blood pressure, are supported while the underlying cause is treated.in the longer term, healthcare staff will give supportive treatment on a hospital ward. this can involve providing nutrition, trying to prevent infections, moving the person regularly so they don’t develop bedsores, and gently exercising their joints to stop them becoming tight.the experience of being in a coma differs from person to person. some people feel they can remember events that happened around them while they were in a coma, while others don’t.some people have reported feeling enormous reassurance from the presence of a loved one when coming out of a coma.when visiting a friend or loved one in a coma, you may find the advice below helpful: when you arrive, announce who you are talk to them about your day as you normally would – be aware that everything you say in front of them might be heard show them your love and support – even just sitting and holding their hand or stroking their skin can be a great comfortresearch has also suggested that stimulating the main senses – touch, hearing, vision and smell – could potentially help a person recover from a coma.as well as talking to the person and holding their hand, you might want to try playing them their favourite music through headphones, putting flowers in their room or spraying a favourite perfume.a coma usually only lasts a few weeks, during which time the person may start to gradually wake up and gain consciousness, or progress into a different state of unconsciousness called a vegetative state or minimally conscious state. a vegetative state – where a person is awake but shows no signs of being aware of their surroundings or themselves a minimally conscious state – where a person has limited awareness that comes and goessome people may recover from these states gradually, while others may not improve for years, if at all.people who do wake up from a coma usually come round gradually. they may be very agitated and confused to begin with.some people will make a full recovery and be completely unaffected by the coma. others will have disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. they may need physiotherapy,occupational therapyand psychological assessment and support during a period of rehabilitation, and may need care for the rest of their lives.the chances of someone recovering from a coma largely depend on the severity and cause of their brain injury, their age and how long they’ve been in a coma. but it’s impossible to accurately predict whether the person will eventually recover, how long the coma will last and whether they’ll have any long-term problems.for further information and support from healthcare professionals and the families of people in a coma, you may find the following websites helpful: brain and spine foundation headway: the brain injury association icusteps: the intensive care patient support charity severe head injury brain and spine foundation: moderate to severe head injuries headway: coma icusteps: patients and relatives',\n",

       " 'Common heart conditions': 'there are many different heart conditions and problems which are collectively called heart disease.it’s always best to discuss your heart condition with your health professional or heart specialist who can advise you on the correct diagnosis and name of your condition and treatment plan.heart disease and different conditions affect the heart’s ability to work efficiently.it can be worrying and confusing to be diagnosed with a heart condition, but there’s a lot of information and support available to you. sometimes understanding what is happening can help you worry less.the most common heart condition in scotland is coronary heart disease. this is caused when the heart’s blood vessels – the coronary arteries – become narrowed or blocked and can’t supply enough blood to the heart.it can lead to angina and/or a heart attack.read more about coronary heart diseaseangina is a pain or discomfort in your chest, arm, neck, stomach or jaw that happens when the blood supply to your heart becomes restricted because of your arteries becoming narrowed. this clogging is called atheroma. angina is a symptom of coronary heart disease, not an illness in itself.angina is your heart’s way of telling you it’s not getting enough oxygen when you’re doing something strenuous or you’re feeling under stress. many people learn to recognise how much activity will bring on an angina attack – this is called stable angina.if you have unexplained chest pain, seek urgent medical advice – you will need an assessment of your overall health.unstable angina can be undiagnosed chest pain or a sudden worsening of existing angina. it happens when the blood supply to the heart is severely restricted and angina attacks occur more frequently, with less and less activity.these attacks may even happen at rest or wake you from sleep. they can last up to 10 minutes.you should see your doctor urgently, and you may be admitted to hospital.until tests confirm the diagnosis, this is sometimes called acute coronary syndrome (acs).read more aboutanginaa heart attack – also known as myocardial infarction or mi – happens when the blood supply to part of your heart muscle becomes completely blocked. this is most commonly caused by a piece of fatty material breaking off and a blood clot forms within a coronary artery. this can cause damage to the part of your heart muscle which that particular coronary artery was supplying.read more about thesymptoms of a heart attackif the heart’s pumping action can’t work effectively, your heart muscle can’t meet your body’s demand for blood and oxygen, and your body develops various different symptoms, like fatigue and shortness of breath. this is called heart failure because of the failure of your heart to work efficiently.read more aboutheart failurethe heart muscle has its own electrical system which helps to stimulate the heartbeat. if the electrical signals within your heart are interrupted or disturbed, your heart can beat too quickly (tachycardia), too slowly (bradycardia) and/or in an irregular way. this is called an arrhythmia.read aboutarrhythmiaon the chest heart & stroke scotland websitethe valves open and close to regulate the flow of blood through the heart. problems with the valves can increase the workload of your heart and can put a strain on your heart muscle, leading to a range of symptoms, like:read aboutheart valve problemson the chest heart & stroke scotland websiteanother condition which can affect the heart is high blood pressure or hypertension. although it’s not a disease in itself, hypertension can lead to an increased risk of developing serious conditions such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks and strokes.read more abouthigh blood pressureandreducing the risks to your heartcongenital heart conditions occur when there’s an abnormality or defect with the structure of the heart of a developing foetus while inside the mother’s womb. a baby may be born with only one defect or with several defects. some types of congenital heart defects are life-threatening, either immediately to the newborn or over time.read more aboutcongenital heart diseaseinherited conditions can be passed on through families. they are sometimes called familial or genetic heart conditions.they can affect people of any age and can be life-threatening. the first sign there’s a problem is often when someone dies suddenly with no obvious cause.these conditions are different from most congenital heart conditions, although some congenital conditions can also be inherited.read more aboutinherited heart conditions adjusting to life with a heart condition congenital heart disease angina',\n",
       " 'Congenital heart disease': 'congenital heart disease is a general term used to refer to a series of birth defects that affect the heart.there are over 30 different types of heart defect.the two main types of congenital heart disease are: cyanotic heart disease acyanotic heart diseasecyanotic heart is where problems with the heart mean there isn’t enough oxygen present in the blood.babies born with cyanotic heart disease generally have a blue-coloured tinge to areas such as their fingers, toes and lips because of a lack of oxygen.they may also experience symptoms of: breathlessness chest pain palpitations fainting fatigueacyanotic heart disease is where the blood contains enough oxygen but it’s pumped abnormally around the body.babies born with acyanotic heart disease may not have any apparent symptoms but, over time, the condition can cause health problems.in this group of conditions there can be a significant increase in blood pressure, putting the heart under more strain as it works much harder. this can weaken the heart, and increases the risk of developing heart failure, where the muscle is unable to efficiently pump blood around the body.in addition, the blood pressure in the lungs is often too high. this is known as pulmonary hypertension and can damage the lungs and cause symptoms such as: breathlessness fatigue dizziness faintingcongenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, with 1 in 180 babies being born with the condition.some babies born with congenital heart disease will require immediate surgery after birth, while many others will probably require surgery or medication at some point during their childhood.congenital heart disease can sometimes develop alongside certain genetic conditions, such asdown’s syndrome.an infection during pregnancy, such as rubella, can also cause congenital heart disease.however, many cases of congenital heart disease have no clear cause.the outlook for congenital heart disease varies depending on the type and severity of the heart defect.research into the causes and improved treatments have meant that, 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood.this poses new challenges for healthcare services because some of these adults have complex health needs and require life-long specialised care. in response to this, the department of health has recommended the creation of specialised centres to care for adults with congenital heart disease.congenital heart disease in adults is sometimes known as ‘grown-up congenital heart disease’ (guch) or adult congenital heart disease (achd).babies with congenital heart disease are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (cardriss) register. the register is maintained by public health scotland.the register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information.it’s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services.further information about cardrissas stated in the introduction, the two main types of congenital heart disease are: cyanotic heart disease acyanotic heart diseasethe symptoms of cyanotic heart disease include: a blue coloured tinge to the lips, fingers and toes (cyanosis) palpitations fainting fatigue chest pains breathing problemschildren with cyanotic heart disease have lower levels of oxygen in their blood, this is known as hypoxia.sometimes, their oxygen levels can fall further and cause additional symptoms such as anxiety and confusion or disorientation.the symptoms of acyanotic heart disease include: severe tiredness palpitations chest pain shortness of breath (particularly during activities such as climbing the stairs)there are some symptoms that are present in both cyanotic and acyanotic heart disease.these include: poor appetite and feeding difficulties sweating, particularly when a baby is feeding delayed growthchildren with acyanotic heart disease are usually underweight, and children with cyanotic heart disease are usually underweight and small for their age.to understand how congenital heart disease can affect your child’s heart and general health, it’s useful to first understand how a healthy heart works.find out how your heart works, on the british heart foundation website.congenital heart disease develops when abnormalities in the heart’s structure prevent it from working as it should.as outlined in theintroduction, the two main types of congenital heart disease are: cyanotic heart disease acyanotic heart diseasefind common causes of each below.ventricular septal defect (vsd) is a very common cause of acyanotic heart disease. in cases of vsd, there is a hole between the left and right ventricle.as blood pressure is higher on the left-hand side of the heart, blood is pushed through the hole and into the right ventricle.the heart then has to work harder to pump the excess blood out of the right ventricle, which can put a strain on the heart. the excess level and pressure of the blood can also increase the blood pressure in the lungs and damage them (pulmonary hypertension).atrial septal defect (asd) is a similar type of defect to vsd, but the hole is between the left and right atria rather than the ventricles.asd can place extra strain on the heart, and potentially damage the lungs.when referring to a ‘hole in the heart’, healthcare professionals are usually referring to either vsd or asd.find out more about asd on the british heart foundation website.in pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve in the right side of the heart is unusually narrow meaning that the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the lungs, which can put a strain on the heart.find out more about pulmonary stenosis on the british heart foundation website.in aortic stenosis, the aortic valve in the left side of the heart is unusually narrow, which means that the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve.because the aortic valve is the main route for oxygen-rich blood to supply the body, the narrowing can lower the body’s oxygen supply, which can cause symptoms of breathlessness and dizziness.find out more about aortic stenosis on the british heart foundation website.patent ductus ateriosus (pda) is a duct or passage in the heart that is meant to close shortly after birth.when an unborn baby is in the womb, there is no need for the baby’s heart to send blood to the lungs because the baby is getting all the oxygen it needs from the mother through the placenta.therefore, the ductus ateriosus acts as a bypass, meaning that the blood can flow back into the heart without entering the lungs.shortly after birth, the duct should close as the baby begins to breathe normally. however, in cases of pda, the duct fails to completely close, which means that some oxygen-rich blood that is meant to be pumped away from the lungs leaks back through the duct and back into the lungs.this can place strain on the heart and the lungs because they have to work harder to compensate for the problems caused by the duct.tetralogy of fallot (tof) is the most common cause of cyanotic heart disease. tof is not one heart defect but a combination of four different heart defects. tetralogy is a greek word that means ‘four-fold’, and fallot is the name of the doctor who first identified the condition.in cases of tof, there are four defects that affect the heart: a hole between the left and right ventricle (ventricular septal defect). a narrowing of the pulmonary valve (pulmonary stenosis). the muscles of the right ventricle are unusually thick (right ventricular hypertrophy). the aorta sits over both the left and right ventricles, instead of just the left ventricle in a normal heart (overriding aorta).as a result of this complex set of heart defects, oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-low blood become mixed. this leads to blood with lower-than-normal oxygen content being pumped around the body.as the body’s cells and tissue are not receiving enough oxygen, the child will develop symptoms of cyanotic heart disease.find out more about tof on the british heart foundation website.transposition of the great arteries (tga) is a major cause of cyanotic heart disease.in cases of tga, the pulmonary artery is attached to the left side of the heart, and the aorta is attached to the right side of the heart. this leads to oxygen-low blood, which should be pumped into the lungs, being pumped around the body, causing symptoms of cyanotic heart disease.find out more about tga on the british heart foundation website.in many cases of congenital heart disease, there is no clear reason why a baby is born with a defective heart.the known risk factors for congenital heart disease are listed below.women with diabetes are five times more likely to give birth to a baby with congenital heart disease compared with women who do not have diabetes.it is estimated that out of every 100 pregnancies in women with diabetes, three to four will result in the birth of a baby with a heart defect.the increased risk is thought to be due to the high levels of insulin in the blood, which may interfere with the development of the foetus.the viral infection rubella (also known as german measles) is a major risk factor for congenital heart disease if a woman contracts an infection during early pregnancy.if a woman contracts the viral infection rubella (also known as german measles) during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, there is an 80% chance that her baby will be born with a birth defect, such as congenital heart disease.mothers who exceed the recommended daily alcohol intake during pregnancy have an increased risk of their baby being born with congenital heart disease.alcohol is best avoided during pregnancy; however no more than 2-3 units should be consumed on a daily basis for any adult.there are a number of genetic conditions (health conditions that a baby inherits from one or both parents) that can cause congenital heart disease.down’s syndrome is the most widely known genetic condition that can cause congenital heart disease. down’s syndrome is a condition where children are born with a range of disabilities as the result of a genetic abnormality. approximately half of children with down’s syndrome will have congenital heart disease.other genetic conditions linked to congenital heart disease include: turner syndrome noonan syndromean increasing number of cases of congenital heart disease are now diagnosed by carrying out a foetal echocardiograph before a baby is born.a foetal echocardiograph is made possible by using a type of ultrasound scanner that has been specially designed to build a picture of the unborn baby’s heart. it should be carried out during routine antenatal examinations, usually sometime between the 18th and 20th week of pregnancy.it is not always possible to detect heart defects (particularly mild ones) using a foetal echocardiography.if a baby is born with cyanotic heart disease, a diagnosis can usually be made quickly and confidently due to the distinctive blue colour of their skin.if your baby is born with acyanotic heart disease, their symptoms may not become immediately apparent for several months, or possibly years, after birth.possible signs that your child may have a cyanotic heart disease include: problems feeding slow growth shortness of breath after exercising tiredness after exercising swelling of their hands, feet and anklesyou should contact your gp if your child has any of the above symptoms. further testing can confirm or disprove a diagnosis of congenital heart disease.an echocardiogram may be used to check your child’s heart. sometimes, underlying problems with the heart, which were missed during a foetal echocardiogram, can be detected as a child grows up.find out more about an echocardiogram on the british heart foundation website.an electrocardiogram (ecg) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the child’s heart. electrodes are placed on the skin across the chest, arms and legs, and then connected to an ecg machine. the machine analyses the electrical signals produced by the heart in order to assess the heart rhythm.find out more about an ecg on the british heart foundation website.a chest x-ray of the heart and lungs can check whether there are any abnormalities in the lungs, or whether the heart is larger than normal. both of these can be signs of congenital heart disease.find out more about a chest x-ray on the british heart foundation website.pulse oximetry is a test that measures how much oxygen is present in the blood.the test involves placing a special sensor on your child’s fingertip, ear or toe. the sensor sends out light waves. a computer that is connected to the sensor measures how the light waves are being absorbed, and gives a percentage reading.a healthy person should have a reading of 94% or above. it is common for those with cyanotic heart defects to have readings below this value.cardiac catheterisation is a useful way of finding out more information about exactly how the blood is pumping through the child’s heart.during a cardiac catheterisation, a small flexible tube, known as a catheter, will be inserted into one of the child’s blood vessels, usually in the groin or arm. the tube is moved up into the heart, using x-rays to help guide it.a contrast dye that shows up on x-rays can be injected into the tube. the dye can then be studied as it moves through the heart, enabling medical staff to see how well each chamber of the heart is working. blood pressure readings in different parts of the heart can also be taken; this will help with diagnosis and treatment planning.cardiac catheterisation is usually performed under a local anaesthetic and is a relatively painless procedure.there are a number of different surgical techniques that can be used to treat congenital heart disease. some of these are explained below.a catheter, similar to the tube that is used during diagnosis, is inserted into the heart and tools are passed down the catheter to repair the heart defects.the advantage of this type of surgery is that it’s minimally invasive, which means that your child will not have to have open heart surgery.for more serious types of heart defects, it may be necessary to operate directly on the heart.during open heart surgery, the heart may be stopped and a machine used to pump blood around your child’s body (bypass machine). an incision is made in your child’s chest so that the heart defects can be surgically repaired, or damaged parts of the heart, such as the valves, can be replaced.in more serious cases of congenital heart disease, the heart may be too damaged, and the child too ill, for corrective surgery to be safely carried out. in this circumstance, their heart may have to be replaced with a donated heart.if your child requires a heart transplant, their details will be placed on the national transplant database (ntd). depending on the condition of your child’s heart, it may be necessary to keep them in hospital in order to support the function of their heart until a donated heart becomes available. machines, such as the ventricle assist device (vad), act like an external mechanical heart, and can assist in pumping blood around the body.priority for heart transplants is based on clinical need, rather than on a first-come-first-served basis. if your child is in a very unstable condition, they will be prioritised whereas more stable children will have to wait for a longer period of time.once a donated heart of the right size and blood group becomes available, you will be contacted by the transplant team and asked to go to the transplant unit as soon as possible. you may be given a bleeper so that you can be contacted as soon as possible.find out more about heart transplantation on the british heart foundation website.specific treatments for the most common types of congenital heart disease are described below.if your child is diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect (vsd) or an atrial septal defect (asd), the recommended treatment will depend on the size of the defect.if the defect is small, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ may be recommended, where your child receives no immediate treatment but their health is carefully monitored. this is because 90% of small defects will close as the child grows older.in cases of mild to medium-sized defects, it may be possible to seal the defect using a catheter. the catheter is guided to the site of the hole, and a specially designed mesh is passed through the catheter to seal the defect.in cases of medium to large-sized defects, open-heart surgery may be required. this involves a patch being stitched directly over the defect.if your child is diagnosed with a stenosis (a narrowing one of their valves) the treatment that is recommended will depend on the extent of the stenosis and if they are symptomatic.in mild cases, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ may be recommended. medication that lowers blood pressure may also be recommended to reduce the strain on your child’s heart and lungs.in more serious cases of stenosis, a catheter can be used to widen the valve. a small balloon is passed up through the catheter and then inflated to widen the affected valve. this is known as a balloon angioplasty. once the valve has been widened, the balloon is removed. sometimes, a metal coil (stent) is used to keep the valve widened.in more serious cases of stenosis, it’s sometimes necessary to replace the valve using open heart surgery. replacement valves can be obtained from human donors, or made from artificial materials, such as titanium, or taken from pigs and modified for human use. pigs are used because their hearts are the most similar to the human heart.for people who are too ill or weak to withstand the effects of open heart surgery, a catheter approach can be used. the catheter is passed through a blood vessel in the groin and up into the heart. a replacement valve is passed through the catheter and into position.many cases of patent ductus ateriosus (pda) can be treated shortly after birth, using medication.two types of medication – indomethacin and a special type of ibuprofen – have been shown to effectively stimulate the closure of the duct that is responsible for pda.if a pda does not respond to medication, a catheter can be used to seal the duct with a metal coil or plug.babies born with tetralogy of fallot (tof) who are experiencing severe symptoms of breathlessness may require emergency surgery such as a blalock-taussig shunt (a bt shunt).during a bt shunt, an artery is diverted (or shunted) into the lungs so that a supply of oxygen-rich blood becomes available. further open-heart surgery is then recommended when the baby is old enough to withstand the after-effects of surgery. during open-heart surgery, the defect between the ventricles is sealed and the pulmonary valve is widened.transposition of the great arteries (tga) will require open-heart surgery, which is usually done shortly after your baby is born.a surgical technique, known as an arterial switch, is usually used to treat cases of tga. during an arterial switch, the affected arteries are cut and reattached to their correct position on the other side of the heart.about 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood. living as an adult with congenital heart disease involves a new set of challenges. some adults will require specialised care.routine medical procedures, such as giving birth or having a general anaesthetic, will need to be closely supervised by specialist staff with experience in treating adults with congenital heart disease. there is also the risk that previous heart surgery, such as the insertion of a replacement valve, will fail and that further surgery will be required.due to these factors, it’s recommended that older teenagers register with a specialised adult congenital heart disease clinic. the clinic will be able to provide regular check-ups and assessments, liaise with other specialised medical services as required, and provide on-going support and advice.your gp or treatment team can give you more information about services in your area for adults with congenital heart disease.many children with congenital heart disease will experience delays in their development, and may take longer to reach certain stages in their development, such as walking or talking.some children with congenital heart disease also have associated learning difficulties and require specialised educational and psychological assistance.if your child has congenital heart disease, your local educational authority should draw up an individual education plan (iep). the iep makes an assessment of your child’s current and future needs, and provides access to any specialised services that your child needs, such as speech and language therapy or an educational psychologist.the iep will take into account what level of physical activity is safe for your child. children with congenital heart disease should be encouraged to be as active as possible, but certain activities, such as contact sports, may have to be avoided.both children and adults with congenital heart disease have an increased risk of developing endocarditis.endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart and, left untreated, it can be life-threatening because it damages the valves of the heart.symptoms of endocarditis include: fever chills sweating (including night sweats) muscular aches and pains chest pain coughs weakness and fatigue headache shortness of breathendocarditis will need to be with injections of antibiotics (intravenous antibiotics). this will involve a hospital stay for several weeks.endocarditis usually develops when an infection in another part of the body, such as on the skin or the gums spreads through the blood into the heart.due to the risk of gum disease leading to endocarditis, it is very important that you have excellent oral hygiene if you have congenital heart disease.it is also usually recommended that you avoid having any cosmetic procedure that involves the piercing of the skin, such tattoos or body piercings.

body produces more of the female hormone progesterone, which acts as a muscle relaxant.the bowel normally moves stools and waste products to the anus by a process known as peristalsis. this is when the muscles lining the bowel contract and relax in a rippling, wave-like motion. an increase in progesterone makes it more difficult for the bowel muscles to contract, making it harder to move waste products along.if you’re pregnant, there are ways to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. read more abouttreating constipation.in rare cases, constipation can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) diabetes hypercalcaemia – where there’s too much calcium in the bloodstream underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) muscular dystrophy – a genetic condition that causes muscle wasting multiple sclerosis– a condition that affects the nervous system parkinson’s disease– where part of the brain becomes progressively damaged, affecting

diet, fear about using the toilet and poor toilet training can all be responsible.children who are over-fed are more likely to have constipation, as are those who don’t get enough fluids. babies who have too much milk are also more likely to get constipation. as with adults, it’s very important that your child has enough fibre in their diet.it’s important that you don’t make your child feel stressed or pressured about using the toilet. it’s also important to let your children try things by themselves (when appropriate). constantly intervening when they’re using the toilet may make them feel anxious and may contribute to constipation.some children can feel stressed or anxious about using the toilet. they may have aphobiaabout using the toilet, or feel they are unable to use the toilets at school.this fear may be the result of your child experiencing pain when passing stools. this can lead to poor bowel habits, where children ignore the urge to pass stools and instead withhold them for fear of experiencing pain and discomfort. however, if they do this, their condition will only get worse.in rare cases, constipation in babies and children can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as: hirschsprung’s disease – which affects the bowel, making it difficult to pass stools anorectal malformation – where the baby’s anus and rectum don’t form properly spinal cord abnormalities – including rare conditions such as spina bifida and cerebral palsy cystic fibrosis– a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick and sticky mucus, which can lead to

history.your pharmacist will ask you some questions about your bowel habits. don’t feel embarrassed about discussing this with your pharmacist. it’s important they’re aware of all of your symptoms, so they can make the correct diagnosis.your pharmacist may also ask questions about your diet, level of exercise and whether there have been any recent changes to your routines.constipation can be defined in a number of ways: opening the bowels less than 3 times a week needing to strain to open your bowels on more than a quarter of occasions passing a hard or pellet-like stool on more than a quarter of occasionsif your pharmacist thinks you may have faecal impaction (when dry, hard stools collect in your rectum), they may advise you to contact your gp for a physical examination. readcomplications of constipationfor more information about faecal impaction.a typical examination will begin with you lying on your back, while the gp feels your abdomen (tummy). you’ll then lie on your side while your gp carries out a rectal examination using a lubricated, gloved finger. your gp will be able to feel for any stools that may have collected.an internal physical examination rarely needs to be carried out on a child. instead, the diagnosis can usually be made by feeling the child’s tummy.if you’re experiencing severe symptoms, your doctor may request further tests, such asblood testsor thyroid tests, to diagnose or rule out other conditions.other tests you may have include: an abdominalx-ray– where x-ray radiation is used to produce images of the inside of your abdomen transit study examination – where you take a short course of special capsules that show up on x-rays; one or more x-rays are taken later on to see how long it takes for the capsules to pass through your digestive system anorectal manometry – where a small device with a balloon at one end is inserted into your rectum and attached to a machine that measures pressure readings from the balloon as you squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles; this gives an idea of how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are workingas there’s an increased risk ofbowel cancerin older adults, your doctor may also request tests to rule out a diagnosis of cancer, includinga computerised tomography (ct) scanor colonoscopy.treatment for constipation depends on the cause, how long you’ve had it and how severe your symptoms are.in many cases, it’s possible to relieve the symptoms by making dietary and lifestyle changes.changes to diet and lifestyle are often recommended as the first treatment for constipation. in many cases, this will improve the condition without the need for medication.some self-help methods of treating constipation are: increase your daily intake offibre(you should eat at least 18 to 30g of fibre a day) add some bulking agents, such as wheat bran, to your diet to help make your stools softer and easier to pass avoiddehydrationby drinking plenty of water exercise more regularly – for example, by going for a dailywalkorrun if constipation is causing pain or discomfort, you may want to take a painkiller, such asparacetamol– always follow the dosage instructions carefully; children under 16 shouldn’t takeaspirin keep to a routine (a place and time of day) when you’re able to spend time on the toilet and respond to your bowel’s natural pattern: when you feel the urge, don’t delay try resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet, so that your knees are above your hips; this can make passing stools easier if medication you’re taking could be causing constipation, your gp may be able to prescribe an alternativeread aboutpreventing constipationfor more ways to change your diet and lifestyle.your pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative if diet and lifestyle changes don’t help.laxativesare a type of medicine that help you pass stools. there are several different types of laxative and each one has a different effect on your digestive system.your pharmacist will usually start you on a bulk-forming laxative. these work by helping your stools to retain fluid. this means they’re less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. bulk-forming laxatives also make your stools softer, which means they should be easier to pass.commonly prescribed bulk-forming laxatives include ispaghula husk, methylcellulose and sterculia. when taking this type of laxative, you must drink plenty of fluids, and don’t take them before going to bed. it will usually be 2 to 3 days before you feel the effects of a bulk-forming laxative.if your stools remain hard after you’ve taken a bulk-forming laxative, your pharmacist may prescribe an osmotic laxative instead. osmotic laxatives increase the amount of fluid in your bowels. this softens your stools and stimulates your body to pass them.commonly prescribed osmotic laxatives include lactulose and macrogols. as with bulk-forming laxatives, make sure you drink enough fluids. it will usually be 2 to 3 days before you feel the effect of the laxative.if your stools are soft, but you still have difficulty passing them, your pharmacist may recommend a stimulant laxative. this type of laxative stimulates the muscles that line your digestive tract, helping them to move stools and waste products along your large intestine to your anus.the most commonly prescribed stimulant laxatives are senna, bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate. these laxatives are usually only used on a short-term basis, and they start to work within 6 to 12 hours.according to your individual preference and how quickly you need relief, your pharmacist may decide to combine different laxatives.if you’ve had constipation for a short time, your pharmacist will usually advise you to stop taking the laxative once your stools are soft and easily passed.however, if your constipation is caused by an underlying medical condition or a medicine you’re taking, your gp may advise you to take laxatives for much longer, possibly many months or even years.if you’ve been taking laxatives for some time, you may have to gradually reduce your dose, rather than coming off them straight away. if you have been prescribed a combination of laxatives, you’ll normally have to reduce the dosage of each laxative, one at a time, before you can stop taking them. this can take several months.your gp will advise you about when it’s best to stop taking long-term laxatives.faecal impaction occurs when stools become hard and dry and collect in your rectum. this obstructs the rectum, making it more difficult for stools to pass along.sometimes as a result of impaction, overflowdiarrhoeamay occur (where loose stools leak around the obstruction). you may have difficulty controlling this.if you have faecal impaction, you’ll initially be treated with a high dose of the osmotic laxative macrogol. after a few days of using macrogol, you may also have to start taking a stimulant laxative.if you don’t respond to these laxatives, and/or if you have overflow diarrhoea, you may need one of the following medications.suppository – this type of medicine is inserted into your anus. the suppository gradually dissolves at body temperature and is then absorbed into your bloodstream. bisacodyl is an example of a medication that can be given in suppository form.mini enema – where a medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus and into your large bowel. docusate and sodium citrate can be given in this way.if you’re pregnant, there are ways for you to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. your pharmacist will first advise you to change your diet by increasing fibre and fluid intake. you’ll also be advised to do gentle exercise.if dietary and lifestyle changes don’t work, you may be prescribed a laxative to help you pass stools more regularly.lots of laxatives are safe for pregnant women to use because most aren’t absorbed by the digestive system. this means that your baby won’t feel the effects of the laxative.laxatives that are safe to use during pregnancy include the osmotic laxatives lactulose and macrogols. if these don’t work, your pharmacist may recommend taking a small dose of bisacodyl or senna (stimulant laxatives).however, senna may not be suitable if you’re in your third trimester of pregnancy, because it’s partially absorbed by your digestive system.read more aboutconstipation and other common pregnancy problems.if your baby is constipated but hasn’t started to eat solid foods, the first way to treat them is to give them extra water between their normal feeds. if you’re using formula milk, make the formula as directed by the manufacturer and don’t dilute the mixture.you may want to try gently moving your baby’s legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels.if your baby is eating solid foods, give them plenty of water or diluted fruit juice. try to encourage them to eat fruit, which can be puréed or chopped, depending on their ability to chew. the best fruits for babies to eat to treat constipation are: apples apricots grapes peaches pears plums prunes raspberries strawberriesnever force your baby to eat food if they don’t want to. if you do, it can turn mealtimes into a battle and your child may start to think of eating as a negative and stressful experience.if your baby is still constipated after a change in diet, they may have to be prescribed a laxative. bulk-forming laxatives aren’t suitable for babies, so they’ll usually be given an osmotic laxative. however, if this doesn’t work, they can be prescribed a stimulant laxative.for children, laxatives are often recommended alongside changes to diet. osmotic laxatives are usually tried first, followed by a stimulant laxative if necessary.as well as eating fruit, older children should have ahealthy, balanced diet, which also contains vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta.try to minimise stress or conflict associated with meal times or using the toilet. it’s important to be positive and encouraging when it comes to establishing a toilet routine. allow your child at least 10 minutes on the toilet, to make sure they’ve passed as many stools as possible.to encourage a positive toilet routine, try making a diary of your child’s bowel movements linked to a reward system. this can help them focus on using the toilet successfully.constipation rarely causes any complications or long-term health problems. treatment is usually effective, particularly if it’s started promptly.however, if you have long-term (chronic) constipation, you may be more at risk of experiencing complications.continually straining to pass stools can cause pain, discomfort and rectal bleeding.in some cases, bleeding is the result of a small tear around the anus (anal fissure), but it’s more often caused byhaemorrhoids (piles). piles are swollen blood vessels that form in the lower rectum and anus.as well as bleeding, piles can also cause pain, itching around the anus, and swelling of the anus.thesymptoms of pilesoften settle down after a few days without treatment. however, creams and ointments are available to reduce any itching or discomfort.see your pharmacist as soon as possible if you experience any rectal bleeding.long-term constipation can increase the risk of faecal impaction, which is where dried, hard stools collect in your rectum and anus.once you have faecal impaction, it’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to get rid of the stools naturally.faecal impaction makes constipation worse because it’s harder for stools and waste products to pass out of your anus, as the path is obstructed.faecal impaction can sometimes lead to a number of other complications, including: swelling of the rectum a loss of sensation in and around your anus bowel incontinence bleeding from your anus rectalprolapse– where part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your anus (this can also occur as a result of repeated straining in people with chronic constipation)faecal impaction is usually treated with laxative medication, although suppositories (medication inserted into the anus) and mini enemas (where medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus) may sometimes be used.there are a number of things you can do to prevent constipation, including making diet and lifestyle changes.including enough fibre in your diet can significantly reduce your chances of developing constipation. most adults don’t eat enough fibre.you should aim to have about 30g of fibre a day. you can increase your fibre intake by eating more: fruit and vegetables wholegrain rice wholewheat pasta wholemeal bread seeds and oatseating more fibre will keep your bowel movements regular, because it helps food pass through your digestive system more easily. foods high in fibre also make you feel fuller for longer.it’s important to increase your fibre intake gradually, because a sudden increase may make you feel bloated. suddenly increasing your intake of fibre may also cause you to produce more wind (flatulence) and experience stomach cramps.read more about how to increase your intake of fibre andeating a healthy, balanced diet.make sure you drink plenty of fluids to avoiddehydration, and steadily increase your intake when exercising or when it’s hot. try to cut back on the amount of caffeine, alcohol and fizzy drinks you consume.never ignore the urge to go to the toilet, because it can significantly increase your chances of having constipation.when going to the toilet, make sure you have enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably.keeping active and mobile will greatly reduce your risk of getting constipation. you should do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week.as well as regular exercise reducing your risk of becoming constipated, it will also leave you feeling healthier and improve your mood, energy levels and general fitness.read more abouthealth and fitnessandphysical activity guidelines for adults. haemorrhoids (piles) laxatives british

symptoms, or very mild symptoms. this is known as remission. this may be followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome. these are known as flare-ups or relapses.less common symptoms include: a high temperature (fever) of 38°c (100°f) or above feeling sick (nausea) being sick (vomiting) joint pain and swelling (arthritis) inflammation and irritation of the eyes (uveitis) areas of painful, red and swollen skin – most often the legs mouth ulcers anal pain and discharge due to perianal crohn’schildren with crohn’s disease may grow at a slower rate than expected. diarrhoea for more than 7 days persistent abdominal pain unexplained weight loss blood in your poo concern about your child’s developmentthe exact cause of crohn’s disease is unknown.a combination of factors may be responsible, including: genetics – genes you inherit from your parents a problem with the immune system (the body’s defence against infection and illness) – where it attacks healthy bacteria in the gut and causes inflammation environmental factors – like air pollution, medication or previous infections smoking – smokers are twice as likely to develop crohn’s disease, and usually have more severe symptoms than non-smokersyour gp will usually ask you about: your pattern of symptoms your diet any recent travel – for example, you may have developed travellers’ diarrhoea whether you’re taking any medication, including any over-the-counter medicines whether anyone else in your family has any bowel conditionsyour gp may also carry out a tests to check your general health. for example, they may: check your pulse check your blood pressure measure your height and weight measure your temperature examine your abdomen (tummy)your gp may also: arrangeblood teststo check for inflammation, infection andanaemia ask for a stool (poo) sample to use a qfit test to check for blood and mucus, infection or inflammation via a faecal calprotectin testyou may be referred to a gastroenterologist. a gastroenterologist is a specialist in conditions of the digestive system. they might recommend more tests, such as: gastroscopy – a thin flexible tube with a camera is put into your mouth to look at your food pipe and stomach colonoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the whole of your large bowel sigmoidoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the end of your large bowel a colon capsule endoscopy(pill camera) x-rayorbarium enema mri scanorct scanyou will be told what tests you need and what you need to do to prepare for them.there’s currently no cure for crohn’s disease, but treatment can improve the symptoms and keep the inflammation under control.your treatment will usually be provided by a range of healthcare professionals.once your symptoms are under control, you are likely to be offered treatment to help keep them under control. if your crohn’s stays under control for a long time, you may choose to stop treatment. you may need to start again if your symptoms come back.the first treatment offered is usually steroids, such as prednisolone or budesonide (corticosteroids) to reduce inflammation quickly. steroids are often effective in reducing your symptoms. but they can have significantside effects. so they’re not suitable for long-term use and your dose will slowly be reduced when your symptoms start to improve.medicines to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) may be given alongside steroids if your symptoms flare up twice or more during 12 months, or return when your steroid dose is reduced.common types include azathioprine, mercaptopurine and methotrexate.if steroids and immunosuppressants don’t help or aren’t right for you, biological therapies may be used.biological therapies block particular chemicals involved in the immune response, which helps reduce inflammation. they’re made using living cells in a lab. they can be given as a drip or an injection. treatment usually lasts at least 12 months. your inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) team will be able to discuss these with you.common types are adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab or vedolizumab.there’s a risk that these medicines may cause side effects, which can cause symptoms such as: itchy skin a high temperature joint and muscle pain swelling of the hands or lips problems swallowingyou should seek immediate medical help if you experience these symptoms. reactions can occur immediately after treatment or months later, even after treatment stops.surgery to treat crohn’s disease may be an option if: you choose to have surgery instead of taking medications that may cause side effects medications don’t control your symptoms your quality of life is severely affected by your condition you have serious complications of crohn’s diseasesurgery might involve widening narrow parts of your bowel, or removing parts of it (resection).resection involves removing the inflamed area of the intestine.if you have a resection, you might have the healthy sections of bowel joined back together. or you might have the end of your small bowel joined to the skin of your tummy (anileostomyor stoma). in this case, poo comes out of the opening on your tummy and is collected in special bags that you wear. an ileostomy might be temporary, to give your bowel time to heal, or it might be permanent.your ibd team will tell you what surgery they recommend and let you know what to expect.there is no evidence that a particular diet causes or triggers flare-ups of crohn’s disease. but alongside medications, some changes to your diet may help control symptoms for some people. eat 5 to 6 small meals rather than 3 main meals try to eat a healthy, varied diet that includes a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, proteins and wholegrains drink plenty of waterdo not make major changes to your diet without talking to your ibd team and make sure you are still getting all the nutrients you need. you can speak to your ibd team about: keeping a food diary to find out if any particular foods affect your symptoms removing trigger foods from your diet taking a food supplement if you are struggling to get enough nutrients from your diet being referred to a dietitianif you smoke, it is advised that you make every effort tostop smoking, especially if you need to have surgery.if you smoke, smoking can make crohn’s worse and is it important that you make every effort tostop smoking.a woman’s chance of becoming pregnant isn’t usually affected by crohn’s disease.however, surgery for crohn’s disease might affect your fertility.most women with crohn’s disease will have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. but if you’re pregnant or planning a pregnancy you should discuss it with your ibd team. this is because they may need to change your medication.if you’re having a flare-up of crohn’s disease you may also be advised to avoid getting pregnant until it’s under control.over time, inflammation can damage sections of the digestive system. this can result in complications such as: narrowing of the bowel (stricture) a channel developing between your bowel and your skin, another section of bowel or a body organ (fistula)these problems usually need surgical treatment.if you have crohn’s disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the national congenital anomaly and rare diseases registration service (ncardrs).this helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. you can opt out of the register at any time.find out more about the register ulcerative colitis inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) crohn's & colitis uk: crohn's disease crohn's & colitis uk: symptoms crohn's & colitis uk: tests and

       " 'Croup': 'croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe (trachea), the airways to the lungs (the bronchi) and the voice box (larynx).children with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in.they may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked. has severe breathing difficulties has an increased breathing rate (they’re too breathless to feed or talk) or ‘silent chest’ (you’re unable to hear sounds of breathing) has a worsening cough or rasping sound shows

croupcommonly, croup is caused by a virus. several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus.read more about thecauses of croupcroup usually affects young children aged between six months and three years, with most cases occurring in one-year-olds.however, croup can sometimes develop in babies as young as three months, and older children up to 15 years of age. adults can also get croup but this is rare.the condition is more common during the late autumn and early winter months.it tends to affect more boys than girls.a child may experience croup more than once during childhood.most cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. sitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important, because crying may make symptoms worse. your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.a single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually also be prescribed to help reduce the swelling in the throat.if your child has breathing problems they may need hospital treatment, such as adrenaline and oxygen through a mask.read more abouttreating croupmost cases of croup clear up within 48 hours. however, in some cases symptoms can last for up to two weeks.it is extremely rare for a child to die from croup.there are a number of conditions that can follow croup, such aspneumoniaandmiddle ear infection.read more about thecomplications of croup.croup is spread in a similar way to the common cold, so it is difficult to prevent.good hygiene is the main defence against croup, such as regularly washing hands and cleaning surfaces.a number of your child’s routine vaccinations also protect against some of the infections that can cause croup. these include: mmr– protection from measles, mumps and rubella dtap/ipv/hib– protection from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and haemophilus influenzae type ba child can get croup at any time of the year, although it’s more likely to occur during late autumn or early winter.this may be because there are more viruses, such ascoldsand flu, around at this time of year.typical symptoms of croup include: a bark-like cough a hoarse or croaky voice difficulty breathing a harsh grating sound when breathing in, called stridorstridor is often most noticeable when the child cries or coughs. but in more severe cases of croup it can also occur when the child is resting or sleeping.symptoms tend to be worse at night.some children have cold-like symptoms for a few days before developing croup symptoms.these cold-like symptoms can include: sore throat runny nose cough high temperature (fever)although croup symptoms usually only last for a few days, they can occasionally last up to two weeks.croup can usually be diagnosed by a gp and mild cases can be treated at home. has severe breathing difficulties has an increased breathing rate (they’re too breathless to feed or talk) or ‘silent chest’ (you’re unable to hear sounds of breathing) has a worsening cough or rasping sound shows distress and agitation has dark, blue-tinged or pale skin the skin around their ribs and chest appears to be pulled in and tight, making the bones of their chest and ribs more visible has abnormal drowsiness and sleepiness has an inability to drink fluidsyou should take them toyour nearest hospital’s accident and emergency departmentor dial 999 for an ambulance.some of these symptoms may indicate a potentially life-threatening underlying condition called epiglottitis (inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis).the symptoms could also indicate tracheitis (inflammation of the windpipe), which also requires immediate medical attention.croup usually develops as the result of a viral infection. the infection causes the larynx (voice box) to become swollen and the trachea (windpipe) to become blocked, and may affect the tubes in the lungs (bronchi). it is sometimes called laryngo-tracheo-bronchitisthe parainfluenza virus is the most common cause of croup. four strains of the virus are responsible for most croup cases. these are: parainfluenza i parainfluenza ii parainfluenza iii parainfluenza ivparainfluenza i is responsible for most cases of croup.the virus can be transmitted through close contact with infected people, as well as contaminated objects and surfaces. as with many airborne viruses, the parainfluenza virus is often spread by breathing in droplets from infected coughs or sneezes.a number of other viruses can also cause croup. these include: influenza a and b (flu viruses) themeaslesvirus, in children who have not been immunised against measles the rhinovirus (common cold virus) enteroviruses the respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), which can cause severe breathing problems andpneumoniain babiesless common causes of croup include: inhaling a small object such as a peanut or a pen cap (inhaled foreign body) epiglottitis – inflammation of the epiglottis, (the flap at the base of the tongue that keeps food from going into the windpipe) an allergic reaction to substances such as pollen or dust mites inhalation of irritants, such as chemicals acid leaking back out of the stomach and into the throat (acid reflux)a gp can diagnose croup by studying your child’s symptoms, particularly the sound of their cough. they may also check your child’s temperature for a fever and ask whether they have recently had a cold or viral infection.in some cases, a pulse oximetry test may be carried out. this involves clipping a sensor onto your child’s earlobe or finger to find out their oxygen levels.the test does not hurt and should not distress your child, and determines whether your child is absorbing enough oxygen into their blood.your gp will decide whether your child needs to be admitted to hospital or whether their croup is safe to treat at home.you should not try to check your child’s throat yourself, because it could trigger a spasm (sudden narrowing) of the airway. this could cause the airway to swell even more, making breathing even more difficult.croup can usually be diagnosed by studying your child’s symptoms, but your gp may want to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.other possible causes for your child’s symptoms are: an abnormality of the airway, which has been present from birth an abscess in the tissues in the back of the throat inhaled material (something they have breathed in) swelling of the deeper layers of the skin (angio-oedema) epiglottitis congenital lesion an allergic reactionin very rare cases, epiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottis) or tracheitis (inflammation of the windpipe) can cause similar symptoms to croup. in these cases, however, your child will usually feel very unwell generally, rather than just having the specific symptoms of croup.differentiating these causes from croup may require further tests.if your child is admitted to hospital with severe croup, or if treatment is unsuccessful, further investigations may be needed to examine their neck and chest area for a possible obstruction.an x-ray may be recommended if it is thought your child may have inhaled something and it is obstructing their airway.treatment of croup depends on how severe the symptoms are. most cases are mild and can be managed at home.however, if your child has severe croup, they will need to be admitted to hospital urgently.if your gp thinks your child has mild croup, they will usually recommend managing it at home.this will often involve using children’sparacetamolto ease any pain associated with the condition and may help lower your child’s temperature if they have a fever.you should also ensure your child is well hydrated by encouraging them to drink plenty of fluids.comforting your child is also important because their symptoms may get worse if they are agitated or crying. if your child is distressed, sitting them upright on your lap will help to comfort and reassure them.your gp will usually prescribe a single dose of an oralcorticosteroidmedication called dexamethasone or prednisolone to help reduce swelling (inflammation) in your child’s throat. side effects of these medications can include restlessness, vomiting, upset stomach and headache.steam treatment is not advised for the treatment of croup. there is no evidence that allowing your child to breathe in humid air, for example steam from a hot bath or shower in a closed room, will help.you should seek urgent medical advice if you notice your child’s symptoms getting worse.painkillers, such as paracetamol andibuprofen, are available in liquid form for children. you can get liquid paracetamol and ibuprofen over the counter from pharmacies and some supermarkets.children under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin.speak to your pharmacist or gp if you are unsure about what type of painkiller is suitable for your child.do not use cough medicines or decongestants as these do not help ease the symptoms of croup. these treatments often have drowsy side effects, which can be dangerous when a child has breathing difficulties.in severe cases of croup, treatment in hospital may be required.breathing problems, such as shortness of breath, are a major symptom of severe croup.you should dial 999 immediately for an ambulance if your child is struggling to breathe.if your child has severe croup, they may be given adrenaline through a nebuliser. this will help improve symptoms within 10 to 30 minutes and the effects should last for up to two hours. a nebuliser allows your child to breathe the medication as a mist.if your child is very distressed and finding it difficult to breathe, they will be given oxygen through an oxygen mask.as with milder cases of croup, oral dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually be given to help reduce any swelling in your child’s airways.in rare cases croup may require hospitalisation, where a child may need intubation. during intubation, a tube is inserted either through a nostril or the mouth and passed down into the windpipe. this will help your child breathe more easily.intubation is usually performed undergeneral anaesthetic. this means your child will be completely unconscious throughout the procedure so they do not experience pain or distress.complications that develop as a result of croup are rare.if an obstructed airway is not treated promptly, it can lead to: severe breathing difficulty (respiratory distress) respiratory arrest (where breathing stops but the heart continues beating)always phone 999 for an ambulance if your child is struggling to breathe.your child may find it difficult to drink fluids as a result of an obstruction in their airway. however, it is important they have plenty of fluids to avoiddehydration.if your child refuses fluids, try not to force them. this could distress your child and make the condition worse.a secondary infection can sometimes develop following the initial viral infection that caused croup. a secondary infection can potentially cause: pneumonia, a chest infection which causes swelling of the tissue in one or both lungs bacterial tracheitis, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection that can occur after a viral respiratory infectionalthough rare, other possible complications of croup can includemiddle ear infectionand lymphadenitis, an infection of the glands of the immune system (lymph nodes).',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis': 'cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition in which the lungs and digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus.it can cause problems with breathing and digestion from a young age. over many years, the lungs become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly.most cases of cystic fibrosis in the uk are now identified through screening tests carried out soon after birth. it’s estimated that 1 in every 2,500 babies born in the uk has cystic fibrosis.a number of treatments are available to help reduce the problems caused by the condition, but unfortunately average life expectancy is reduced for people who have it.symptoms of cystic fibrosis tend to start in early childhood, although they can sometimes develop very soon after birth, or may not be obvious until adulthood.some of the main symptoms of cystic fibrosis can include: recurringchest infections difficulty putting on weight frequent, wet-soundingcoughs diarrhoea occasional wheezing andshortness of breathpeople with the condition can also develop a number of related conditions, includingdiabetes, thin, weakened bones (osteoporosis) and liver problems.read more about thesymptoms of cystic fibrosiscystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both of their parents.the faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. this, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body’s tubes and passageways.to be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit two copies of this faulty gene – one from each of their parents. their parents will not usually have the condition themselves, because they will only carry one faulty gene and one that works normally.if both parents carry the faulty gene, there’s a 25% chance that each child they have will be born with cystic fibrosis.read more about thecauses of cystic fibrosismost cases of cystic fibrosis are now detected soon after birth through thenewborn blood spot test.this involves collecting a drop of blood from the baby’s heel and testing it for abnormalities that could indicate cystic

normal a genetic test – where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosisthese tests can also be carried out in older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who haven’t been screened previously.if you have a family history of cystic fibrosis, you can be tested to determine if you’re at risk of having a child with the condition by checking

associated with cystic fibrosis are outlined below.cystic fibrosis can cause sticky mucus to clog the lungs and airways. this can cause: recurringchest infections– these occur because mucus in the lungs is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria persistent inflammation of the airways, which can cause them to become abnormally widened (bronchiectasis) increasedcoughing occasional wheezing andshortness of breathover time, the lungs can become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly.the mucus can also block parts of the digestive system, which can affect how food travels through the gut and how it’s broken down or absorbed.this can cause: a serious bowel obstruction in the first few days of life (meconium ileus) – this will often need an operation to remove the blockage jaundice diarrhoeaor large, smelly stools problems putting on weight and growing – this can occur because the body struggles to digest and absorb nutrients (malnutrition) diabetesfrom late childhood or early adulthood – this can develop if the pancreas becomes severely damagedpeople with cystic fibrosis can also experience a number of other problems, including: sinusitis nasal polyps thin, weakened bones (osteoporosis) – this can occur as a result of repeated infections, poor growth, lack of physical activity and malnutrition swelling and pain in the joints (arthritisor arthralgia) from late childhood difficulty conceiving children – most men with cystic fibrosis are unable to have children naturally (although some fertility treatments may still work) because the tubes that carry sperm don’t develop correctly; women can become pregnant, however liver problems caused by the tiny bile ducts in the liver becoming blocked by mucus leaking of small amounts of urine, particularly during coughing fits (stress incontinence)cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both their parents.the faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. this, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body’s tubes and passageways – particularly the lungs and digestive system.the condition is present from birth and cannot be caught from someone else who has it.genes come in pairs. you inherit one set from your mother and one set from your father.to be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty gene from both of their parents.this can happen if the parents are ‘carriers’ of the faulty gene. this means they don’t have cystic fibrosis themselves, but they can have a child with the condition if their partner also carries the faulty gene.it’s estimated that around 1 in every 25 people in the uk are carriers of the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis.if both parents are carriers, there’s a: 25% chance that each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and won’t have cystic fibrosis or be able to pass it on 50% chance that each child they have will just inherit one copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier 25% chance that each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have cystic fibrosisthis is known as an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.tests can be carried out to diagnose cystic fibrosis at any age.most cases are now detected soon after birth through newborn screening, but older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who weren’t screened can also have tests to check for the condition.tests to find out if you are a ‘carrier’ of the faulty gene responsible for cystic fibrosis may also be recommended for some people.anewborn blood spot testis offered to all babies in scotland to help detect problems early on, including cystic fibrosis.when your baby is five to eight days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. the blood is then sent to a laboratory to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis.you should receive the results by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. you will be contacted sooner if a problem is found, and you’ll be asked to attend a hospital appointment.the screening result isn’t 100% accurate, so more tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. you, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis.tests to confirm a diagnosis will be carried out if screening suggests that your child may have cystic fibrosis, or your doctor thinks you could have the condition and you haven’t been screened previously.two main tests can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis: sweat test – a test to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal genetic test – where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosisthe sweat test is most commonly used, although genetic testing may be done if the sweat test result is inconclusive or to identify the specific genetic fault that’s causing the condition.testing to find out if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis may be useful if: you have a close relative, such as a child, sibling or parent, who’s a known carrier you have a close relative with cystic fibrosis your partner is known to carry the cystic fibrosis genethis can be done using a blood test, or occasionally a special mouthwash, to collect a sample of cells. the sample is then sent to a laboratory so it can be checked for the faulty gene.finding out whether you’re a carrier of the faulty gene can help determine if you’re at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis. a genetic counsellor will explain the results of the test to you and discuss the implications and options available for future pregnancies.there’s currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but it’s possible to help control the symptoms, prevent or reduce complications, and make the condition easier to live with.a person with cystic fibrosis will be supported by a team of healthcare professionals at a specialist cystic fibrosis centre. a care plan will be drawn up that’s tailored to their individual needs.a range of treatments may be used and sometimes treatment in hospital will be needed. regular appointments to monitor the condition will also be recommended.some of the main treatments for cystic fibrosis include:people with cystic fibrosis may need to take a number of different medicines to treat and prevent lung problems. these may be swallowed, inhaled or injected.some of the main medicines for cystic fibrosis are: antibioticsto prevent and treatchest infections medicines to make the sticky mucus in the lungs thinner, such as dornase alfa, hypertonic saline and mannitol dry powder a medicine called ivacaftor to help reduce the levels of mucus in the body – although this is only suitable for fewer than 1 in every 20 people (4%) with cystic fibrosis bronchodilatorsto widen the airways and help make breathing easier steroid medicationto treat nasal polyps (small growths inside the nose)it’s also important that people with cystic fibrosis are up to date with allroutine vaccinationsand have theflu jabeach year once they’re old enough.in addition to medication, special techniques can be used to help keep the lungs and airways clear. a physiotherapist can give you advice.some of the main techniques include: active cycle of breathing techniques (acbt) – a technique that involves a sequence of relaxed breathing, followed by deep breathing exercises and then huffing autogenic drainage – a series of gentle breathing techniques that clear mucus from the lungs modified postural drainage – a technique that involves changing your position to make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs airway clearance devices – handheld devices that use vibration and air pressure to help remove mucus from your airways; you may have to pay in the region of £45-60 for one of these devicesyour care team can provide more information on the techniques mentioned above.for people with cystic fibrosis, getting the right nutrition is vital in helping them develop normally and stopping them becoming frequently ill.however, the majority of people with cystic fibrosis cannot digest food and absorb nutrients from when they’re a baby. occasionally, the condition can cause the pancreas to become damaged over time, causing the same problem.a dietitian will advise on what you can do to help avoidmalnutrition. they may recommend: taking digestive enzyme capsules with all meals and snacks to help with digestion – the number of capsules needed depends on the food being eaten and varies from person to person following a special balanced diet that’s high in calories (energy), fat and protein taking vitamin and mineral supplementsin severe cases of cystic fibrosis, when the lungs stop working properly and all medical treatments have failed to help, alung transplantmay be recommended.a lung transplant is a serious operation that carries risks, but it can greatly improve the length and quality of life for people with severe cystic fibrosis.the outlook for people with cystic fibrosis is often better than for many transplant patients, as they’re often younger and in better general health. it’s estimated that up to 9 out of 10 people will survive for at least a year after a transplant.the cystic fibrosis trust has information onlung transplants in cystic fibrosis.people with cystic fibrosis can have a number of other problems that may benefit from treatment.for example: exercise can help keep bones and joints healthy, and is recommended for everyone with cystic fibrosis – any sport or exercise is usually good, but if you’re not sure about a particular activity, you should ask your physiotherapist for advice medicines called bisphosphonates can help treat weak and brittle bones that may occur as a result of cystic fibrosis if the person doesn’t get enough vitamind and calcium (from their diet and/or from supplements) insulin medication and a

this avoids exposing your genitals to the chemicals in your cleaning products for too long going to the toilet as soon as you need to pee and always emptying your bladder fully staying well hydrated –

can be similar to several other conditions, so it’s important to get a proper diagnosis.if you’re a woman who has had cystitis before, you don’t necessarily need to see your gp again. cystitis is very common in women and mild cases often get better on their own. speak to a pharmacist if you need any advice abouttreating cystitis.however, you should see your gp if your symptoms are severe or don’t start to get better in a few days, you get cystitis frequently, or you’re pregnant.children and men should always be seen by a gp if they have symptoms of cystitis, as the condition is less common and could be more serious in these groups.cystitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection, although it sometimes happens when the bladder is irritated or damaged for another reason.most infections are thought to occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body) and start to multiply.cystitis is much more common in women than men, probably because the anus (back passage) is closer to the urethra in women and the urethra is much shorter.it’s not always obvious how the bacteria get into the bladder, but it can be caused by: having sex wiping your bottom after going to the toilet – particularly if you wipe from back to front inserting a tampon orurinary catheter(a thin tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder) using adiaphragmfor contraceptionthere are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing an infection in your bladder.if you’re unable to empty your bladder fully, any bacteria that get inside may not be flushed out when you go to the toilet and can multiply more easily.you may not be able to empty your bladder fully if: you have a blockage in your urinary system, such as a bladder stone you’re pregnant, as the baby may be pressing on your bladder (in men) you have anenlarged prostategland that presses on the urethrafor women who have been through themenopause, or are going through it, the lining of the urethra can shrink and become thinner because of a lack of the hormone oestrogen.the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina may also change, which can allow potentially harmful bacteria to become more common.this can make the urethra more vulnerable to infection, which could spread into the bladder.you’re more likely to get cystitis if you havediabetes– a condition where the level of sugar in your body becomes too high.high levels of sugar in your urine can provide a good environment for bacteria to multiply, so any bacteria that get into the bladder are more likely to cause cystitis.cystitis can also be caused by damage or irritation to the urethra and bladder.this can be the result of: friction from sex chemical irritants, such as those in perfumed soap or bubble bath damage caused by a catheter or surgery on your bladder radiotherapyto your pelvis or treatment with certainchemotherapymedicines a woman’s genitals having been deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasons (an illegal practice calledfemale genital mutilation or fgm)cystitis has also been linked to

returns, as mild cases often get better withoutantibiotics. you can try the self-help measures or ask your pharmacist for advice.if you’ve had cystitis before and don’t feel you need to see your gp, the following advice may help to relieve your symptoms until the condition clears up: take over-the-counter painkillers, such asparacetamoloribuprofen– always read the medicine information leaflet beforehand to check whether you can take it, and check with your pharmacist if you’re not sure drink plenty of water – it’s been suggested this may help flush the infection out of your bladder and some people find it helpful, although it’s not clear how effective it actually is use a hot water bottle – holding a hot water bottle on your tummy or between your thighs may reduce any discomfort

bicarbonate or potassium citrate) reduce their symptoms, but there’s a lack of evidence to suggest they’re effective.these products are also not suitable for everyone. check with your gp or pharmacist before trying them if you’re taking any other medication.in some cases, your gp may prescribe a course of antibiotics. this will usually involve taking a tablet or capsule 2 to 4 times a day for 3 days.antibiotics should start to have an effect quite quickly. return to your gp if your symptoms haven’t started to improve within a few days.most people won’t have any side effects from antibiotic treatment, but possible side effects can include feeling or being sick,itching, a rash anddiarrhoea.if you keep getting cystitis (known as recurrent cystitis) your doctor may prescribe stand-by antibiotics or continuous antibiotics.a stand-by antibiotic is a prescription you can take to a pharmacy the next time you have symptoms of cystitis, without needing to visit your gp first.continuous antibiotics are taken for several months to prevent further episodes of cystitis. these may be prescribed: if cystitis usually occurs after having sex – you may be given a prescription for antibiotics to take within 2 hours of having sex if cystitis is not related to having sex – you may be given a low-dose antibiotic to take for a trial period of 6 monthsyour doctor may also recommend some

       " 'Edwards’ syndrome': 'edwards’ syndrome (also known as trisomy 18) is a genetic condition that begins to affect babies when they’re in the womb, and continues to impact their health throughout their life. it’s a rare but serious condition.in the uk, around 3 in every 10,000 births are affected by edwards’ syndrome.when a baby is conceived (made), they inherit genetic material from both their parents. this genetic material is called a chromosome.humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes. in each pair, 1 of the chromosomes is inherited from the mother and 1 is inherited from the father.if a baby has edwards’ syndrome, they have inherited an extra copy of chromosome 18. this extra copy can be present in some or all of the baby’s cells and can lead to health problems for the baby.there are 3 different forms of edwards’ syndrome:in full form edwards’ syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 18. this extra copy is present in all of the baby’s cells.around 94% of babies born with edwards’ syndrome have the full form of the syndrome.in mosaic form edwards’ syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 18, but the copy is only present in some of the baby’s cells.in partial form edwards’ syndrome, the baby has only inherited part of an extra copy of chromosome 18. this is a very rare form of edwards’ syndrome.most cases result from a random change in the egg or sperm in healthy parents. this change is not caused by anything the parents did before or during pregnancy.you’ll be offeredscreening for edward’s syndromewhen you’re between 11 and 14 weeks pregnant.the screening test will show if your baby has a high or low chance of having edwards’ syndrome.if screening shows that there’s a high chance your baby has edwards’ syndrome, you can choose to have a furtherdiagnostic testif you wish.no test can tell if your baby has full, mosaic or partial edward’s syndrome or how they’ll be affected.around 7 in 10 (70%) of pregnancies diagnosed with edwards’ syndrome from screening tests will end inmiscarriageorstillbirth.the risk of miscarriage decreases as the pregnancy progresses, but there’s still a risk of stillbirth.if your baby is affected by edwards’ syndrome, it is likely they will have associated health conditions (other conditions often found in babies with edwards’ syndrome). some of these may be serious. exactly how your baby is affected will depend on the form of edwards’ syndrome they have.full form edwards’ syndrome is considered to be a life-limiting condition. this means it can affect how long a baby can live.around 5 in 10 (52.5%) will live longer than 1 week. around 1 in 10 (12.3%) will live longer than 5 years.babies born with full form edwards’ syndrome will have a learning disability which may be severe. they’re also likely to have a wide range of health conditions, some of which can be serious. statistically:currently we can’t predict how babies with mosaic or partial forms of edwards’ syndrome will be affected. this is because it depends on: how many cells contain the extra chromosome (mosaic) how much of the extra chromosome they have (partial)some babies may have severe health problems like those seen in full form edwards’ syndrome. other babies may have much less serious health issues. there are even cases where the baby seems to have no health issues at all.many babies with the mosaic form of edwards’ syndrome will have some form of learning disability and developmental delay (when a child takes longer to start doing certain activities, like walking and talking, than other children their age).the life expectancy for babies with mosaic or partial forms of edwards’ syndrome is also very variable. some will live long lives, while others will have a much shorter life expectancy.each child is unique, and edwards’ syndrome will affect each child differently. like all children they’ll have their own personalities, likes and dislikes, and things that make them who they are.babies with full form edwards’ syndrome usually have a low birthweight and are considered “medically fragile”. this means they are at high risk of infections and complications that require treatment in hospital. they may also: have difficulty feeding and may need fed by a tube have difficulty breathing and have apnoea (pauses in their breathing)despite their complex needs, children with edwards’ syndrome can make progress with their development, although slowly.many children are reported to be able to communicate their needs, show awareness of surroundings, and some can sit and stand supported. there are also cases of older children attending school.feedback from many parents suggests that children with edwards’ syndrome have a good quality of life and are valued members of the family.babies with edwards’ syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (cardriss) register. the register is

electrical signals. they communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. during a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. this can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.the severity of seizures can differ from person to person. some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a “trance-like” state for a few seconds or minutes. others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).some people might only have a single seizure. if they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.people with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms.seizures can occur when you’re awake or asleep.the type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. there are:some seizures do not fit into these categories and are known as unclassified seizures.there are two main types of focal seizure.focal aware seizures are where you remain fully conscious throughout.symptoms of a focal aware seizure can include: a general strange feeling that is hard to describe a “rising” feeling in your tummy – sometimes likened to the sensation in your stomach when on a fairground ride an intense feeling that events have happened before (déjà vu) experiencing an unusual smell or taste a tingling sensation, or “pins and needles”, in your arms and legs a sudden intense feeling of fear or joy stiffness or twitching in part of the body, such as an arm or handthese seizures are sometimes known as “warnings” or “auras”, because they can be a sign that another type of seizure is on its way. this can give you time to warn people around you and make sure you’re in a safe place.focal impaired awareness seizures are when you lose your sense of awareness. you won’t remember what happened after this type of seizure.the symptoms of a focal impaired awareness seizure can involve random bodily behaviour, like: smacking your lips rubbing your hands making random noises moving your arms around picking at clothes fiddling with objects adopting an unusual posture chewing or swallowingduring a focal impaired awareness seizure, you’ll not be able to respond to anyone else. you’ll usually have no memory of it.there are 6 main types of generalised seizure.absence seizures mainly affect children, but they also occur in adults. they cause the person to lose awareness of their surroundings, usually for up to 15 seconds. the person will seem to stare vacantly into space. some people will flutter their eyes or smack their lips. the person will have no memory of the seizure.absences can occur several times a day. they may affect a child’s performance at school. they can be dangerous if they occur at a critical time, like crossing a busy road.these types of seizures cause your arms, legs or upper body to jerk or twitch, as if you have received an electric shock. they often only last for a fraction of a second, and you’ll normally remain conscious during this time.myoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up. they can occur in combination with other types of generalised seizures.these cause the same sort of twitching as myoclonic jerks, except the symptoms will last longer, normally up to 2 minutes. you might lose consciousness during a clonic seizure.atonic seizures cause all your muscles to relax suddenly. there’s a chance you may fall to the ground and you could injure yourself.tonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly become stiff. you might lose balance and fall over. like atonic seizures, there’s a risk of injury.tonic-clonic seizures or convulsions have 2 stages. your body will initially become stiff and then your arms and legs will begin twitching. you’ll lose consciousness and some people will wet themselves. the seizure normally lasts a minute, but can last longer.this type of seizure is what most people think of as an epileptic fit.myoclonic-tonic-clonic seizures and myoclonic-atonic are seizures involving a combination of the generalised seizures above.if you see someone having a seizure, there are some things you can do to help. it will not usually be necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure. the seizure has not stopped after 5 minutes the person has more than one seizure without recovering in between you know it’s the person’s first seizure the person is injured, has breathing problems, or needs emergency medical attention for any other reason the person’s behaviour after a seizure is unsafeif you’re with someone who has a seizure: protect them from injury by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby cushion their head with your hands or soft material do not restrain them or attempt to move them (unless they are in immediate danger) don’t put anything in their mouth stay calm, and stay with them until they regain consciousnesswhen the convulsions have stopped, put them into therecovery positionuntil they’ve recovered.status epilepticus is the name for any seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes, or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between. this is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible.you can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy. it’s important to phone 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus.if you’ve been trained to treat the condition, you’ll usually have been advised to use either: a medication called buccal midazolam that comes in liquid form and is given by trickling the liquid onto the inside of the person’s cheek or up their nose (this is the most common immediate treatment) a medication called diazepam that’s placed in the person’s rectum (less commonly used)if you’ve tried one of these treatments and the seizures are continuing, phone 999 for an ambulance.in some cases of epilepsy a cause cannot be found.if there’s an identifiable cause, it usually involves the brain being affected by a condition.the brain is a delicate mix of nerve cells, electrical impulses and chemicals, known as neurotransmitters. any damage has the potential to disrupt the workings of the brain and cause seizures.the categories of epilepsy can be separated by their causes which might be:causes of structural epilepsy can include: cerebrovascular disease (problems with the blood vessels that supply the brain) – such as astrokeor subarachnoid haemorrhage brain tumours severe head injuriesa genetic abnormality can cause epilepsy. research has found more genetic causes of epilepsy.sometimes epilepsy is hereditary (passed on from one or both parents) or it can be a new gene abnormality.infections likemeningitiscan cause damage to the brain which can result in epilepsy. viral infections like hiv can also cause epilepsy.sometimes epilepsy is caused by an imbalance of the bodies chemicals. this is very rare.autoimmune conditions that cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) can cause someone to develop epilepsy.in many cases, no cause of epilepsy is found. this may be because medical investigations are not advanced enough to identify the cause.for many people with epilepsy, seizures can occur without any obvious trigger. however, certain circumstances or the use of certain substances can sometimes come before a seizure. these include: stress lack of sleep withdrawal from alcohol following heavy drinking some medications illegal drugs yourmenstrual cycle or period flashing lights (this is an uncommon trigger that affects less than 5% of people with epilepsy, and is known as photosensitive epilepsy)keeping a seizure diary is a good way to help find out what might trigger your seizures. every time you have a seizure, record it and make a note of what you were doing. over time, you might notice some avoidable things that seem to trigger your symptoms.epilepsy is usually difficult to diagnose quickly. in most cases, it cannot be confirmed until you have had more than one seizure.it can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions, like fainting,migrainesandpanic attacks, can cause similar symptoms.if you’ve had a seizure, you’ll be referred to a specialist in epilepsy. this will normally be a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system).some of the most important pieces of information needed to diagnose epilepsy are the details about your seizures.the doctor will ask you what you can remember and any symptoms you may have had before it happened – things like feeling strange before the seizure or experiencing any warning signs. it is extremely useful to talk to anyone who seen your seizure and ask them exactly what they saw, especially if you cannot remember.the doctor will also ask about your medical and personal history. they’ll ask whether you use any medicines, drugs or alcohol.the doctor may be able to make a diagnosis of epilepsy from the information you give. they might run further tests like an electroencephalogram (eeg) ormagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan.even if these tests don’t show anything, it’s still possible that you have epilepsy based on your symptoms and description of your seizures.anmri scanis a type of scan which uses strong magnetic fields to produce detailed images of the inside of your body.it can be useful in cases of suspected epilepsy. it can often detect possible causes of the condition, such as defects in the structure of your brain.an eeg test can detect unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. it measures the electrical activity of your brain through electrodes placed on your scalp.during the test, you may be asked to breathe deeply or close your eyes and you may be asked to look at a flashing light. the test will be stopped immediately if it looks like the flashing light could trigger a seizure.in some cases, an eeg may be carried out while you’re asleep (sleep eeg). or you may be given a small, portable eeg recording device to monitor your brain activity over 24 hours (ambulatory eeg).you might be asked to come into the hospital for a few days to have a video telemetry and eeg. during this, an eeg and video will be used to monitor you.most people with epilepsy can be successfully treated with anti-seizure medication (asms). asms do not cure epilepsy, but can prevent seizures from occurring.there are many different asms. they work by changing the levels of the chemicals in your brain that conduct electrical impulses. this reduces the chance of a seizure.the type of asm recommended for you will depend on a number of factors like: the type of seizures you have your age whether there are any concerns about a certain asm interacting with other medicines (like thecontraceptive pill) whether you’re thinking of having a babyexamples of commonly used asms include sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and levetiracetam.asms are available in different forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids and syrups.it’s important you follow any advice about when to take asms and how much to take. never suddenly stop taking an asm because it could cause a seizure.you shouldn’t take any other medicines whilst taking asms without speaking to your gp or epilepsy specialist. this includes over-the-counter medicines or complementary medicines such as st john’s wort. other medicines could have a dangerous interaction with your asm and cause a seizure.sodium valproate is not usually prescribed for women of childbearing age. this is because it could cause a baby to have physical defects or developmental problems.it can be used if there is no alternative, or if your specialist has assessed you and it’s unlikely you’ll respond to or tolerate other treatments. your specialist or gp will also need to check you’re using a reliable form of contraception. learn more about therisks of valproate medicines during pregnancy.side effects are common when starting treatment with asms. they’re usually short-lived and pass in a few days.speak to your healthcare team for more information on the side effects.if your epilepsy is still poorly controlled after trying treatment with asms, you may be referred to a specialist epilepsy centre. they’ll assess if you’re suitable for surgery.this involves having various types of brain scans to find out where the epilepsy is focused. memory and psychological tests will assess how the surgery might affect you.surgery is only recommended when: a single area of the brain is causing seizures (focal seizures) removing that part of the brain would not cause any significant loss of brain functionmost people recover from the effects of surgery after a few days. but it could be several months before you’re feeling fit and able to return to work.your doctor might suggest an alternative procedure if: your epilepsy is still poorly controlled after trying treatment with asms brain surgery is not suitable for youthis might be vagus nerve stimulation (vns).vns involves surgically implanting a small electrical device under your skin, near your collarbone. the device is like apacemaker.the device has a wire that’s wrapped around one of the nerves in the left side of your neck, known as the vagus nerve. the device passes a regular dose of electricity to the nerve to stimulate it. this can help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.if you feel the warning sign of a seizure coming on, you can activate an extra “burst” of stimulation. this might prevent the seizure from occurring. the stimulation normally occurs every five minutes and lasts for 30 seconds.how and why vns works is not fully understood. it’s thought that stimulating the vagus nerve alters the chemical transmissions in the brain.most people who undergo vns still need to take asms.the battery for the vns device typically lasts up to 10 years. after 10 years you’ll need another procedure to replace it.a ketogenic diet is a diet high in fats and low in carbohydrates and protein. it’s thought that it may make seizures less likely by altering the chemical composition of the brain.a ketogenic diet is sometimes advised for children with seizures that are difficult to control and have not responded to asms. this is because it’s reduces the number of seizures in some children. it should only be used under the supervision of an epilepsy specialist with the help of a dietitian.it can also be effective in adults with certain types of epilepsy.regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone. they can help prevent many conditions, includingheart diseaseand many forms ofcancer.try to eat a balanced diet, containing all the food groups, to give your body the nutrition it needs. exercising regularly can increase the strength of your bones, relieve stress and reduce fatigue.alcohol can also interact with anti-seizure medication (asms). asms can heighten the effects of alcohol. alcohol also can make the side effects of asms worse and make the medication less effective.heavy drinking can disrupt your sleep patterns. this increases your chances of having a seizure. drinking no more than therecommended daily limitsmay help reduce this risk.read more about drinking and alcoholsome anti-seizure medication (asms) can reduce the effectiveness of some types of contraception. this includes: contraceptive injections contraceptive patches the combined oral contraceptive pill– often known as ‘the pill’ theprogesterone-only pill (pop)or ‘mini pill’ contraceptive implantsif you’re sexually active and do not want to become pregnant, ask your gp or epilepsy specialist if your asms could affect your contraception.you may need to ensure you or your partner use another form of contraception like acondomorintrauterine device (iud).the effectiveness of the asm lamotrigine may be reduced if you’re taking the combined oral contraceptive pill.some asms can make the emergency contraceptive pill less effective. if you need emergency contraception, you may need an iud. your gp, family planning clinic or pharmacist should be able to help you.there’s no reason why women with epilepsy cannot have a healthy pregnancy.it’s better if the pregnancy is planned because there’s a slightly higher risk of complications. with forward planning, you can minimise these risks.the main risk is that some asms increase the chances of a serious birth defect, like spina bifida, cleft lip orcongenital heart disease. the risks depend on the type of asm and the dose you’re taking.theuk epilepsy and pregnancy registercan provide more information and advice about the use of asms during pregnancy.if you’re planning a pregnancy, talk to your epilepsy specialist. it may be possible to change the asm you’re taking to minimise risks. taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of a folic acid supplement each day can also help reduce risks of birth defects. you might be recommended to take more than this by your healthcare team.if you discover you’re pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine. the risks to your baby from uncontrolled seizures are far higher than any risks associated with your medicines.if you’re breastfeeding or planned to breastfeed, discuss the medication you’re taking with your healthcare team or midwife.many children with well-controlled epilepsy can learn and take part in their school’s activities unaffected by their condition. others may need extra support to get the most out of their time at school.make sure your child’s teachers know about their condition and the medication they need to control it.epilepsy is more common among children with learning disabilities and special educational needs. these children are entitled to extra help to overcome their difficulties.you must tell the driving and vehicle licence authority (dvla) if you’ve had any epileptic seizures or blackouts. you must stop driving right away. if you ignore these regulations, you might be prosecuted.the dvla may wish to contact your gp or epilepsy specialist.the dvla may issue a licence if your seizures have never caused you to lose awareness or affected your ability to safely control a vehicle.your gp has a legal responsibility to inform the dvla if they feel that your driving is putting both you and others at risk.read about epilepsy and driving on the dvla websitewhen somebody with epilepsy dies and there’s no clear cause, it’s known as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (sudep).the risk of sudep for someone with epilepsy is low.the exact causes of sudep are unknown. it’s not possible to predict who it will affect. one theory is that seizures could affect the person’s breathing and heartbeat.things that may lead to sudep include: having seizures which cause loss of consciousness and the body to go stiff and jerk (tonic-clonic seizures) poorly controlled epilepsy, such as not using asms prescribed to control seizures having sudden and frequent changes to asms being a young adult (in particular male) having sleep seizures having seizures when alone

       " 'Erectile dysfunction (impotence)': 'erectile dysfunction (ed), also known as impotence, is the inability to get and maintain an erection.erectile dysfunction is a very common condition, particularly in older men. it is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 will have it to some degree.see your gp if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. they will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such asheart disease(when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted).erectile dysfunction can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. physical causes include: narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis – commonly associated withhigh blood pressure(hypertension),high cholesterolordiabetes hormonal problems surgery or injurypsychological causes of ed include: anxiety depression relationship problemssometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. for example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner.if this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). if you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical.erectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medicines.read more about thecauses of erectile dysfunctionalthough you may be embarrassed, it’s important to get a diagnosis so that the cause can be identified.your gp can usually diagnose erectile dysfunction. this will involve answering questions about your symptoms, as well as a physical examination and some simple tests.read more aboutdiagnosing erectile dysfunctionerectile dysfunction is primarily treated by tackling the cause of the problem, whether this is physical or psychological.the narrowing of the arteries (called atherosclerosis) is one of the most common causes of ed. in these cases your gp may suggest lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, to try to reduce your risk ofcardiovascular disease. this may help to relieve your symptoms as well as improving your general health.you may also be given medication to treat atherosclerosis, such as cholesterol-loweringstatinsand drugs to reduce your blood pressure.a number of treatments have been successful in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. medication, such as sildenafil (sold as viagra), can be used to manage it in at least two-thirds of cases. vacuum pumps that encourage blood to flow to the penis and cause an erection are also successful in 90% of cases.psychological treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) and sex therapy.overall, treatments for erectile dysfunction have improved significantly in recent years. most men are eventually able to have sex again.read more abouttreating erectile dysfunctionthe main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ed) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse.ed should not be confused with ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly.sometimes ed only occurs in certain situations. for example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner.in these circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause of ed is primarily psychological (stress related). however, if you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is primarily physical.see your gp if ed persists for more than a few weeks. they will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such asheart disease(when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted).many websites offer treatments for ed but their use is not recommended. the medications that are offered by these sites could be fake and may be dangerous. even if the medications are genuine, they may not be suitable for you.it is important that you only take medication for ed that your gp has prescribed for you.read more abouttreating erectile dysfunctionerectile dysfunction (ed) can have many causes, such as certain medical conditions, medications and stress.it’s important to identify the cause of erectile dysfunction and treat any underlying conditions.when a man becomes sexually excited (aroused), his brain sends signals to the nerves in his penis. the nerves increase the blood flow to the penis, causing the tissue to expand and harden.anything that interferes with the nervous system or the blood circulation could lead to erectile dysfunction.anything that affects the level of sexual desire (libido) can also cause erectile dysfunction because areduced libidomakes it more difficult for the brain to trigger an erection. psychological conditions, such asdepression, can reduce libido, as can changes in hormone levels (chemicals produced by the body).there are four main types of health conditions that can cause physical problems resulting in erectile dysfunction. these are: conditions affecting the flow of blood to your penis – vasculogenic conditions affecting your nervous system, which is made up of your brain, nerves and spinal cord – neurogenic conditions affecting your hormone levels – hormonal conditions affecting the physical structure of your penis – anatomicalpenis injuries or surgical treatment of the penis, pelvis or surrounding areas can sometimes lead to erectile dysfunction.erectile dysfunction is also thought to occur in up to 15-25% of people who experience asevere head injury.examples of vasculogenic conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include: cardiovascular disease– a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) high blood pressure(hypertension) diabetes– a condition caused by high blood sugar levels. this can affect both the blood supply and the nerve endings in your penis, so it is also a neurogenic conditionerectile dysfunction is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. for this reason, it may be one of the first causes your gp considers when making a diagnosis and planning your treatment.examples of neurogenic conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include: multiple sclerosis– a condition that affects the body’s actions, such as movement and balance parkinson’s disease– a condition that affects the way that the brain coordinates body movements, including walking, talking and writing a spinal injury or disorder astroke– a serious condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interruptedexamples of hormonal conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include: hypogonadism – a condition that affects the production of the male sex hormone, testosterone, causing abnormally low levels anoveractive thyroid gland(hyperthyroidism) – where too much thyroid hormone is produced anunderactive thyroid gland(hypothyroidism) – where not enough thyroid hormone is produced cushing’s syndrome– a condition that affects the production of a hormone called cortisolpeyronie’s disease, which affects the tissue of the penis, is an example of an anatomical condition that can cause erectile dysfunction.in some men, certain medicines can cause erectile dysfunction, including: diuretics – these increase the production of urine and are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure and kidney disease antihypertensives – such asbeta-blockers, that are used to treat high blood pressure fibrates – medicines used to lowercholesterollevels antipsychotics – used to treat some mental health conditions, such asschizophrenia antidepressants–  used to treat depression and some types of pain corticosteroids– medication that contains steroids, which are a type of hormone h2-antagonists – medicines used to treatstomach ulcers anticonvulsants – used to treatepilepsy antihistamines – used to treat allergic health conditions, such ashay fever anti-androgens – medication that suppresses androgens (male sex hormones) cytotoxics – medication used inchemotherapyto prevent cancer cells from dividing and growingspeak to your gp if you are concerned that a prescribed medicine is causing erectile dysfunction. alternative medication may be available. however, it is important never to stop taking a prescribed medicine unless you are advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.possible psychological causes of erectile dysfunction include: depression– feelings of extreme sadness that last for a long time anxiety – a feeling of unease, such as worry or fearerectile dysfunction can often have both physical and psychological causes. for example, if you have diabetes, it may be difficult for you to get an erection, which may cause you to become anxious about the situation. the combination of diabetes and anxiety may lead to an episode of erectile dysfunction.there are many emotional issues that may also affect your physical ability to get or maintain an erection. these include: relationship problems lack of sexual knowledge past sexual problems past sexual abuse being in a new relationshipother possible causes of erectile dysfunction include: excessive alcohol intake tiredness using illegal drugs, such as cannabis, heroin or cocainemen who cycle for more than three hours per week may be recommended to try a period without cycling to see if this helps improve erectile dysfunction.riding in the correct position with a properly fitted seat may also help to prevent regular cycling from leading to erectile dysfunction.erectile dysfunction (ed) can often be diagnosed by your gp. they will talk to you about your situation and may carry out a physical examination.your gp may ask you about: your symptoms your overall physical and mental health your alcohol consumption whether you take drugs whether you are currently taking any medicationif you do not want to talk to your gp about erectile dysfunction, you can visit a genitourinary medicine (gum) clinic. you can find your nearest gum clinic on thebritish association for sexual health and hiv (bashh)website.you’ll also be asked about your sexual history. try not to be embarrassed because erectile dysfunction is a common problem. you can request a male gp at your surgery if you prefer.you may be asked about: your previous and current sexual relationships what your sexual orientation is how long you have been experiencing erectile dysfunction whether you can get any degree of erection with your partner, on your own or when you wake up in the morning whether you have been able to ejaculate or orgasm your libido (your level of sexual desire)erectile dysfunction that happens all the time may suggest an underlying physical cause.erectile dysfunction that only occurs when you are attempting to have sex may suggest an underlying psychological (mental) cause.your gp may assess your cardiovascular health. narrowed blood vessels are a common cause of erectile dysfunction and linked withcardiovascular disease(conditions that affect the heart and blood flow).your gp may: measure your blood pressure to see if you havehigh blood pressure(hypertension) listen to your heart rate to check for any abnormalities measure your height, weight and waist circumference to see if you are a healthy weight for your height ask you about your diet and lifestyle, for example, how much exercise you do test a sample of your blood for glucose (sugar) and lipids (fatty substances), as high levels can indicate conditions affecting your heart or blood vesselsa physical examination of your penis may be carried out to rule out anatomical causes (conditions that affect the physical structure of your penis).if you have symptoms of anenlarged prostate, such as weak or irregular urination, adigital rectal examination (dre)may be suggested.blood testscan also check for underlying health conditions. for example, measuring the levels of hormones such as testosterone can rule out hormonal conditions, such as hypogonadism (an abnormally low level of testosterone).in some cases you may be referred to a specialist for further testing. this might be the case if you are unusually young to be experiencing erectile dysfunction as it’s rare in men under 40 years of age.an intracavernous injection test involves injecting a man-made (synthetic) hormone into your penis to increase the blood flow. this helps assess any abnormalities in your penis and plan surgery.if the injection doesn’t result in an erection it may indicate a problem with the blood supply to your penis. in some cases, you may also need anultrasound scan.these specialised tests involve injecting dye into the blood vessels of your penis and studying the dye on a scanner. these are likely to be used if you are being considered for surgery or if a problem has been detected with your blood vessels.if the cause of your erectile dysfunction is thought to be psychological, you may be reffered for a psychological assessment.if you have erectile dysfunction (ed), treatment will depend on what’s causing it. the various treatments for erectile dysfunction are outlined below.if your erectile dysfunction is caused by an underlying health condition, such asheart diseaseordiabetes, that condition may need to be treated first. in some cases, treating the underlying cause may also resolve the problem.if you are taking medication that can cause erectile dysfunction, there may be an alternative. it is important never to stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your gp or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care.erectile dysfunction can often be improved by making changes to your lifestyle, such as: losing weightif you are overweight giving up smoking cutting back youralcoholconsumption not taking illegal drugs exercising regularly reducingstressas well as helping to improve your erectile dysfunction, these changes can also improve your general health and may help to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels).read more aboutpreventing cardiovascular diseasephosphodiesterase-5 (pde-5) inhibitors are one of the most widely used and effective types of medication for treating erectile dysfunction. they work by temporarily increasing the blood flow to your penis.in england, four pde-5 inhibitors are available for treating erectile dysfunction. they are: sildenafil – sold under the brand name viagra tadalafil – sold under the brand name cialis vardenafil – sold under the brand name levitra avanafil – sold under the brand name spedrasildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil work for about eight hours and they are designed to work ‘on demand’. tadalafil lasts for up to 36 hours and is more suitable if you require treatment for a longer period of time, for example, over a weekend.depending on the type of pde-5 inhibitor you are taking and the dose, it should take about 30-60 minutes before it starts to work. with sildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil, you should be able to have sex from one to 10 hours after taking the medicine. after taking tadalafil, the effects will last for up to 36 hours.it may take longer to notice the effects if the tablet is taken with food, so it’s best to take it on an empty stomach. you can then eat after an hour without affecting the medicine.only take one tablet within a 24-hour period.your gp should explain the benefits of each medication and how it works. the choice may depend on: how often you are sexually active whether you have tried any of the medications beforethere have been many studies to test the effectiveness of these medications. in general, at least two-thirds of men report having improved erections after taking one of these medicines.if you do not find that pde-5 inhibitors are effective it may be because: you have not waited long enough after taking the dose you have waited too long after taking the dose the dose is not high enough you have not had enough sexual stimulationthese medications are triggered by sexual stimulation, so you also need to be aroused for it to work.pde-5 inhibitors should be used with caution in men who havecardiovascular disease, such as coronary heart disease. however, sexual activity is also likely to be beneficial for your cardiovascular health. you should discuss the risks and benefits with your gp.pde-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who have anatomical problems with their penis, such as peyronie’s disease (a condition that affects the tissue of the penis).pde-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who: are at risk of priapism – a painful erection that lasts for several hours are also taking long lasting alpha-blockers – a medication used to treat a number of conditions, such ashigh blood pressure(hypertension)do not take pde-5 inhibitors if you are also taking medicines or recreational drugs that contain nitrates. the combination of the two substances can have a dangerous effect on your heart.organic nitrates are often used to treat angina, and butyl nitrate is a recreational drug that is more commonly known as ‘poppers’.you are also warned not to take pde-5 inhibitors if you: have been advised not to take part in sexual activity or in activities that widen your blood vessels havelow blood pressure(hypotension) have recently had astroke– a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted have unstableangina– an underlying heart condition that causes symptoms such as chest pain have had aheart attack– a medical emergency where the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked have a history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy – an eye condition that causes a sudden loss of visionpde-5 inhibitors can cause some side effects, including: headaches and migraines flushing (redness) indigestion nausea (feeling sick) vomiting (being sick) a blocked or runny nose back pain vision disturbances muscle paina vacuum pump consists of a clear plastic tube that is connected to a pump, which is either hand or battery operated.you place your penis in the tube and pump out all of the air. this creates a vacuum that causes the blood to fill your penis, making it erect. you then place a rubber ring around the base of your penis to keep the blood in place, allowing you to maintain an erection for around 30 minutes.it may take several attempts to learn how to use the pump correctly, but they are usually effective. after using a vacuum pump, nine out of 10 men are able to have sex, regardless of the cause of their ed.you should not use a vacuum pump if you have a bleeding disorder or if you are takinganticoagulant medicines, which reduce the ability of your blood to clot.side effects of vacuum pumps include pain or bruising, although these occur in less than a third of men.men who qualify for nhs prescriptions for erectile dysfunction treatments may be able to get a vacuum pump on the nhs (see above for more details). however, some men will need to buy one.thesexual advice associationproduces a number of factsheets, including one on vacuum pumps that provides details of companies that supply them.if your erectile dysfunction doesn’t respond to treatment, or you are unable or unwilling to use pde-5 inhibitors or a vacuum pump, you may be given a medicine called alprostadil. this is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that helps to stimulate blood flow to the penis.alprostadil is available as: an injection directly into your penis – this is called an intracavernosal injection a small pellet placed inside your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the tip of your penis) – this is called urethral applicationyou may be trained to correctly inject or insert alprostadil. if your partner is pregnant, use a condom during sex if you are inserting alprostadil into your urethra.alprostadil will usually produce an erection after five to 15 minutes. how long the erection lasts will depend on the dose.in men who did not respond to pde-5 inhibitors, alprostadil injections were successful in 85 out of 100 men. alprostadil inserted into the urethra is successful for up to two-thirds of men.alprostadil should not be used: in men at risk of priapism (a painful erection that lasts for several hours) – for example, those with sickle cell anaemia alongside other erectile dysfunction medications if you have a penile implant or if you have been advised to avoid sexual activityurethral application may also not be used in: some men who have anatomical problems with their penis (conditions that affect the physical structure of the penis) men who have infections of their penis, such as balantis (inflammation of the head of the penis)alprostadil can cause some side effects including: changes in your blood pressure dizziness headache pain in your penis urethral burning or bleeding reactions at the site of the injection, such as swellingas with pde-5 inhibitors, nhs prescriptions for alprostadil may only be available for men with particular health conditions or those receiving some types of medical treatments. if you need to pay the full prescription cost, a single injection of alprostadil costs around £8 to £22, depending on the dose. a single dose of alprostadil for urethral application is around £10.if a hormonal condition is causing erectile dysfunction, you may be referred to an endocrinologist (who specialises in the treatment of hormonal conditions).hormones are chemicals produced by the body. many hormonal conditions can be treated using injections of synthetic (man-made) hormones to restore normal hormone levels.surgery for erectile dysfunction is usually only recommended if all other treatment methods have failed. it may also be considered in: younger men who have experienced serious injury to their pelvic area – for example, in a car accident men with a significant anatomical problem with their penisin the past, surgery was used if there was clear evidence of a blockage to the blood supply of the penis. the surgeon could unblock the blood vessels to restore a normal supply of blood. however, research now suggests that the long-term results of this type of surgery are poor, so it’s unlikely to be used.penile implants are a type of surgery that may be considered. these can be: semi-rigid implants – which may be suitable for older men who do not have sex regularly inflatable implants – which consist of two or three parts that can be inflated to give a more natural erectionpenile implants are not usually available on the nhs and inflatable implants may be very expensive. however, around three-quarters of men report being satisfied with the results of this type of surgery.as with all types of surgery, having penile implants inserted carries a risk of infection. if you take preventative antibiotics, the rate of infection is around two or three in 100. mechanical problems with the implants may occur within five years in five per cent of cases.if your erectile dysfunction has an underlying psychological cause then you may benefit from a type of treatment called sensate focus.if conditions such as anxiety or depression are causing your erectile dysfunction, you may benefit from counselling (a talking therapy).sensate focus is a type of sex therapy that you and your partner complete together. it starts with you both agreeing not to have sex for a number of weeks or months. during this time, you can still touch each other, but not in the genital area (or a woman’s breasts). the idea is to explore your bodies knowing that you will not have sex.after the agreed period of time has passed, you can gradually begin touching each other’s genital areas. you can also begin to use your mouth to touch your partner, for example, licking or kissing, them. this can build up to include penetrative sex.you can find out more about sensate focus from thecollege of sexual and relationship therapists (cosrt).psychosexual counselling is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your erectile dysfunction. by talking about the issues, you may be able to reduce any anxiety that you have and overcome your erectile dysfunction.the counsellor can also provide you with some practical advice about sex, such as how to make effective use of other treatments for erectile dysfunction to improve your sex life.psychosexual counselling may take time to work and the results achieved have been mixed.cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) is another form of counselling that may be useful if you have erectile dysfunction. cbt is based on the principle that the way you feel is partly dependent on the way you think about things. cbt helps you realise that your problems are often created by your mindset. it is not the situation itself that is making you unhappy, but how you think about it and react to it.your cbt therapist can help you to identify any unhelpful or unrealistic thoughts that may be contributing to your erectile dysfunction – for example, to do with: your self-esteem (the way you feel about yourself) your sexuality your personal relationshipsyour cbt therapist will be able to help you to adopt more realistic and helpful thoughts about these issues.some studies have suggested that, in a few cases, it may be beneficial to exercise your pelvic floor muscles. these are a group of muscles around the underside of the bladder and rectum, as well as at the base of the penis.pelvic floor muscle exercise involves strengthening and training the muscles used to control the anus (back passage) and urinate. if your gp feels this type of exercise could be beneficial, then you may want to discuss it with a physiotherapist to learn it correctly.by strengthening and training these muscles, you may be able to reduce the symptoms of erectile dysfunction.some complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, have claimed to treat erectile dysfunction. however, there is little evidence they are useful.in some cases, they may even include ingredients that could interact with other medications and cause side effects.always speak to your gp before using any complementary therapies. prostate cancer uk institute of psychosexual medicine cosrt: therapy fertility network uk lab tests

in bone. it most commonly develops in the:however, the condition can also develop in the soft tissues surrounding the bone or joint. this type of ewing sarcoma is known as extraosseous, which means outside the bone.the symptoms of ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body.the main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness.other possible, but less common, symptoms may include a high temperature (fever), severe tiredness and weight loss.in some cases of ewing sarcoma, there may not be any symptoms at all. however, as the tumour grows it could weaken the affected bone, increasing the risk of fracture.like other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of ewing sarcoma is unknown.as the condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is that it may be related to fast-growing bones.the rapid growth spurt that happens during puberty may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer.research has also found babies born with an umbilical hernia are 3 times more likely to develop ewing sarcoma.however, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition.thecancer research ukwebsite has more information about therisks and causes of bone cancer.when you visit your gp because of bone pain, they’ll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area.your gp may refer you for anx-rayto check for anything abnormal. if abnormalities are found, you’ll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist).they may recommend that you have amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanto examine the area in closer detail.a bonebiopsymay be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. a fine needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. it can either be carried out using ageneral anaestheticor alocal anaesthetic.thecancer research ukwebsite has more information abouttests for bone cancerandthe stages of bone cancer.like all types of cancer, the earlier ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.ewing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination ofchemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy.chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove.ewing sarcoma also responds well toradiotherapy. it can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning.in some cases, surgically removing ewing’s sarcoma can be difficult – for example, if it develops in the pelvis. in this case, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment.if surgery is recommended, the type you’ll have will depend on: the size of the tumour where it is in your body whether it has grown into the tissues surrounding the boneyou may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. this type of surgery is known as resection.limb-sparing surgery involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg where the cancer is growing. a piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed.in some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed (amputation). this may be the only option to prevent the cancer returning if it’s spread into the tissues surrounding the bone.for more information about thetypes of treatment for bone cancer, visit the cancer research uk website.if you’re diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and frightening. knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you make decisions.the majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a

       " 'Ewing sarcoma: Children': 'ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer in children and young people. this information describes ewing sarcoma, its symptoms, diagnosis and possible treatments.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are now new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.sarcomas are rare types of cancer that develop in the supporting tissues of the body. there are 2 main types: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas.bone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton, but may also develop in the soft tissue near bones.soft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body.ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary sarcoma in children and young people. this type of cancer is a bone cancer and most commonly occurs in the long bones, ribs, pelvis and spine (vertebral column).it usually occurs in the teenage years, and is more common in boys.although ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer, it can also occur very rarely in the soft tissues. this is called extraosseous ewing sarcoma. another type of ewing sarcoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumour (pnet). these can be found in either the bone or soft tissue.the exact causes of primary bone cancer are unknown. the development of ewing sarcoma may be related in some way to times of rapid bone growth, which may explain why more cases are seen in teenagers. like other cancers, it’s not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. it is frequently worse at night. however, symptoms may vary depending on the position and size of the cancer. there may be some swelling in the affected area if the tumour is close to the surface of the body and it may become tender to touch. this may cause a limp if in the leg or pelvis. bone cancer is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the child has a minor fall or accident. occasionally, there may be fever or weight loss.usually you begin by seeing your gp, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or x-rays. if a sarcoma is suspected, your gp should refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre. a variety of tests and investigations are needed to diagnose ewing sarcoma, including an x-ray of the painful part of the bone, a chest x-ray and a blood test. a specialist doctor will remove a small piece of the tumour to look at under a microscope (biopsy). other tests may be done, such as a bone scan, pet scan, a bone marrow biopsy. an mri or ct scan may also be done.any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.a combination of various treatments is used to treat ewing sarcoma. these include chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the size and position of the tumour.chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.this is a very important component of treatment for the majority of children with ewing sarcoma and can help make surgery more straightforward. a combination of different chemotherapy drugs are given before surgery and continued afterwards in order to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the sarcoma from spreading. chemotherapy given in this way is called adjuvant chemotherapy.if surgery is needed, it should be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic bone tumour centre. the aim of surgery is to remove the tumour without causing too much damage. if the tumour is in one of the main bones of the arm or leg, it may be necessary to remove the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone. if only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery.sometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer has affected the surrounding blood vessels and nerves. after amputation, a false limb will be fitted, and this will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. false limbs work very well. it should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sport.there are several ways in which limb-sparing surgery may be done. it may involve:after limb-sparing surgery, the child is often able to use the limb almost normally. however, it is best not to take part in any contact sports, because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it. if the child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened from time to time as the bone grows. this may mean further short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened during an outpatient procedure.radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. ewing sarcoma responds very well to radiotherapy. it’s often used after chemotherapy and before or after surgery. if the tumour is impossible to remove surgically, it’s a good option.treatment often causesside effects. your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. any possible side effects will depend on the actual treatment being used and the part of the body that’s being treated.side effects can include: feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness diarrhoearadiotherapycan cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness. if your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having.a small number of children may develop other side effects, sometimes many years later. these include a reduction in normal bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer later in life. your child’s doctor or nurse will explain all of this to you and will monitor your child carefully for any potential late side effects.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancers. if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. written information will be provided to help explain things.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.your child will have regular follow-up appointments, with x-rays or scans as necessary. many children with ewing sarcoma can be cured. even if the tumour comes back, further treatment may be given successfully. your child will be checked up on every few months for the first 3 years after treatment and then every 6 months for another 2 years.if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor who knows the situation in detail.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",

hearing.if no problems are picked up at this stage, they may be detected during routine checks as your child gets older.in most cases, deafblindness develops as a person gets older. it can happen gradually, so you may not notice that your vision and/or hearing are getting worse at first.it’s therefore important to have routine eye tests to check for any problems. adults should normally have their eyes tested every two years.you can request a hearing test at your gp surgery at any point if you think you may be losing your hearing.a person may be diagnosed with deafblindness if tests show they have both hearing and vision problems.their hearing and vision should continue to be regularly assessed even after they’ve been diagnosed, as the level of care and support they need will depend

environment, amplify it and deliver it into the ear canal of the wearer so that it can be processed by the auditory system. an audiologist (hearing specialist) will be able to recommend the most suitable type of aid after testing your hearing.for some people, hearing aids that deliver the sound into the ear canal are not appropriate. in these cases, hearing may be improved using a surgically implanted hearing system, such as a cochlea implant or bone conducting hearing implant.while these still use a microphone to collect the sound initially, they then covert that sound into either an electrical signal or vibration, passing it to the inner or middle ear for processing by the auditory system. sense: assistive technology for people with hearing loss rnid: hearing aidsevery deafblind

       " 'Deep vein thrombosis': 'deep vein thrombosis (dvt) is a blood clot that develops within a deep vein in the body, usually in the leg.blood clots that develop in a vein are also known as venous thrombosis.dvt usually occurs in a deep leg vein, a larger vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh. it can also occur in the pelvis or abdomen.it can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism.dvt and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism (vte).in some cases, there may be no symptoms of dvt. if symptoms do occur they can include: pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf or thigh) a heavy ache in the affected area warm skin in the area of the clot red skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the kneedvt usually (although not always) affects one leg. the pain may be worse when you bend your foot upward towards your knee.if you think you have deep vein thrombosis ask for an urgent gp appointment or call 111 pain and swelling of the leg, along with either breathlessness or chest painthis is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream. this then blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs, preventing blood from reaching them.if left untreated, about 1 in 10 people with a dvt will develop a pulmonary embolism. a pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition which causes: breathlessness– which may come on gradually or suddenly chest pain – which may become worse when you breathe in sudden collapseboth dvt and pulmonary embolism need urgent investigation and treatment.seek immediate medical attention if you have pain, swelling and tenderness in your leg and develop breathlessness and chest pain.read more about thecomplications of dvteach year, dvt affects around 1 person in every 1,000 in the uk.anyone can develop dvt, but it becomes more common over the age of 40. as well as age, there are also some other risk factors, including: having a history of dvt or pulmonary embolism having a family history of blood clots being inactive for long periods – such as after an operation or during a long journey blood vessel damage – a damaged blood vessel wall can result in the formation of a blood clot having certain conditions or treatments that cause your blood to clot more easily than normal – such as cancer (includingchemotherapyandradiotherapytreatment), heart and lung disease, thrombophilia and hughes syndrome being pregnant – your blood also clots more easily during pregnancy being overweight orobesethecombined contraceptive pilland hormone replacement therapy (hrt) both contain the female hormone oestrogen, which causes the blood to clot more easily. if you’re taking either of these, your risk of developing dvt is slightly increased.read more about thecauses of dvtsee your gp as soon as possible if you think you may have dvt – for example, if you have pain, swelling and a heavy ache in your leg. they’ll ask you about your symptoms and medical history.it can be difficult to diagnose dvt from symptoms alone. your gp may advise that you have a specialisedblood testcalled a d-dimer test.this test detects pieces of blood clot that have been broken down and are loose in your bloodstream. the larger the number of fragments found, the more likely it is that you have a blood clot in your vein.however, the d-dimer test isn’t always reliable because blood clot fragments can increase after an operation, injury or during pregnancy. additional tests, such as an ultrasound scan, will need to be carried out to confirm dvt.anultrasound scancan be used to detect clots in your veins. a special type of ultrasound called a doppler ultrasound can also be used to find out how fast the blood is flowing through a blood vessel. this helps doctors identify when blood flow is slowed or blocked, which could be caused by a blood clot.a venogram may be used if the results of a d-dimer test and ultrasound scan can’t confirm a diagnosis of dvt.during a venogram, a liquid called a contrast dye is injected into a vein in your foot. the dye travels up the leg and can be detected byx-ray, which will highlight a gap in the blood vessel where a clot is stopping the flow of blood.treatment for dvt usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines. these reduce the blood’s ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger.heparin andwarfarinare 2 types of anticoagulant often used to treat dvt. heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. after initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming.a number of anticoagulants, known as directly acting oral anticoagulants (doacs), may also be used to treat conditions such as dvt. these medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban, and they’ve been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects.you’ll also be prescribed compression stockings to wear every day, which will improve your symptoms and help prevent complications.read moreabout treating dvtif you need to go into hospital for surgery, a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while you’re there.if you’re at risk of developing dvt, there are a number of things you can do to prevent a blood clot occurring, both before you go into hospital. these include temporarily stopping taking the combined contraceptive pill, and while you’re in hospital, such as wearing compression stockings.when you leave hospital, your care team may also make some recommendations to help prevent dvt returning or complications developing. these may include: not smoking eating a healthy, balanced diet taking regular exercise maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you’reobesethere’s no evidence to suggest that taking aspirin reduces your risk of developing dvt.see your gp before embarking on long-distance travel if you’re at risk of getting a dvt, or if you’ve had a dvt in the past.when taking a long-distance journey (6 hours or more) by plane, train or car, you should take steps to avoid getting dvt. drink plenty of water, perform simple leg exercises and take regular, short walking breaks.read more aboutpreventing dvtdeep vein thrombosis (dvt) sometimes occurs for no apparent reason.however, the risk of developing dvt is increased in certain circumstances.when you’re inactive your blood tends to collect in the lower parts of your body, often in your lower legs. this is usually nothing to worry about because when you start to move, your blood flow increases and moves evenly around your body.however, if you’re unable to move for a long period of time – such as after an operation, because of an illness or injury, or during a long journey – your blood flow can slow down considerably. a slow blood flow increases the chances of ablood clotforming.if you have to go into hospital for an operation or procedure, your risk of getting a blood clot increases. this is because dvt is more likely to occur when you’re unwell or inactive, or less active than usual.as a patient, your risk of developing dvt depends on the type of treatment you’re having. you may be at increased risk of dvt if any of the following apply: you’re having an operation that takes longer than 90 minutes, or 60 minutes if the operation is on your leg, hip or abdomen you’re having an operation for an inflammatory or abdominal condition, such asappendicitis you’re confined to a bed, unable to walk, or spending a large part of the day in a bed or chair for at least three daysyou may also be at increased risk of dvt if you’re much less active than usual because of an operation or serious injury and have other dvt risk factors, such as a family history of the condition.when you’re admitted to hospital you’ll be assessed for your risk of developing a blood clot and, if necessary, given preventative treatment.if the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, it may become narrowed or blocked, which can cause a blood clot to form.blood vessels can be damaged by injuries such as broken bones or severe muscle damage. sometimes, blood vessel damage that occurs during surgery can cause a blood clot, particularly in operations on the lower half of your body.conditions such as vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels),varicose veinsand some forms of medication, such aschemotherapy, can also damage blood vessels.your risk of getting dvt is increased if you have a condition that causes your blood to clot more easily than normal. these conditions include: cancer – cancer treatments such as chemotherapy andradiotherapycan increase this risk further heart diseaseand lung disease infectious conditions, such as hepatitis inflammatory conditions, such asrheumatoid arthritis thrombophilia – a genetic condition where your blood has an increased tendency to clot antiphospholipid syndrome – an immune system disorder that causes an increased risk of blood clotsduring pregnancy, blood clots more easily. it’s the body’s way of preventing too much blood being lost during childbirth.venous thromboembolism (vte) – dvt and pulmonary embolism – affects about 1 in 100,000 women of childbearing age.dvts are also rare in pregnancy, although pregnant women are up to 10 times more likely to develop thrombosis than non-pregnant women of the same age. a clot can form at any stage of pregnancy and up to 6 weeks after the birth.having thrombophilia (a condition where the blood has an increased tendency to clot), or having a parent, or brother or sister, who’s had a thrombosis, increase your risk of developing a dvt during pregnancy.other risk factors during pregnancy include: being over 35 years old beingobese(with a bmi of 30 or more) expecting 2 or more babies having recently had a caesarean section being immobile for long periods of time smoking (find out how tostop smoking) having severevaricose veins dehydrationlow molecular weight heparin (lmwh) is usually used to treat pregnant women with dvt. lmwh is an anticoagulant, which means it prevents the blood clot getting bigger. it’s given by injection and doesn’t affect your developing baby.thecombined contraceptive pillandhormone replacement therapy (hrt)both contain the female hormone oestrogen. oestrogen causes the blood to clot a bit more easily than normal, so your risk of getting dvt is slightly increased. there’s no increased risk from theprogestogen-only contraceptive pill.your risk of getting dvt is also increased if you or a close relative have previously had dvt and: you’re overweight or obese you smoke you’re dehydrated you’re over 60 – particularly if you have a condition that restricts your mobilityif you have deep vein thrombosis (dvt), you’ll need to take a medicine called an anticoagulant.anticoagulant medicines prevent blood clots getting bigger. they can also help stop part of the blood clot breaking off and becoming lodged in another part of your bloodstream (an embolism).although they’re often referred to as “blood-thinning” medicines, anticoagulants don’t actually thin the blood. they alter proteins within it, which prevents clots forming so easily.heparin and warfarin are 2 types of anticoagulants that are used to treat dvt. heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. after this initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming.heparin is available in 2 different forms: standard (unfractioned) heparin low molecular weight heparin (lmwh)standard (unfractioned) heparin can be given as: an intravenous injection – an injection straight into one of your veins an intravenous infusion – where a continuous drip of heparin (via a pump) is fed through a narrow tube into a vein in your arm (this must be done in hospital) a subcutaneous injection – an injection under your skinlmwh is usually given as a subcutaneous injection.the dose of standard (unfractionated) heparin to treat a blood clot varies significantly from person to person, so the dosage must be carefully monitored and adjusted if necessary. you may need to stay in hospital for 5 to 10 days and have frequentblood teststo ensure you receive the right dose.lmwh works differently from standard heparin. it contains small molecules, which means its effects are more reliable and you won’t have to stay in hospital and be monitored.both standard heparin and lmwh can cause side effects, including: a skin rash and otherallergic reactions bleeding weakening of the bones if taken for a long time (although rare with lmwh)in rare cases, heparin can also cause an extreme reaction that makes existing blood clots worse and causes new clots to develop. this reaction, and weakening of your bones, is less likely to occur when taking lmwh.in most cases, you’ll be given lmwh because it’s easier to use and causes fewer side effects.warfarinis taken as a tablet. you may need to take it after initial treatment with heparin to prevent further blood clots occurring. your doctor may recommend that you take warfarin for 3 to 6 months. in some cases, it may need to be taken for longer, even for life.as with standard heparin, the effects of warfarin vary from person to person. you’ll need to be closely monitored by having frequent blood tests to ensure you’re taking the right dosage.when you first start taking warfarin, you may need to have 2 to 3 blood tests a week until your regular dose is decided. after this, you should only need to have a blood test every 4 weeks at an anticoagulant outpatient clinic.warfarin can be affected by your diet, any other medicines you’re taking, and by how well your liver is working.if you’re taking warfarin you should: keep your diet consistent limit the amount ofalcoholyou drink (no more than 14 units of alcohol a week) take your dose of warfarin at the same time every day not start to take any other medicine without checking with your gp, pharmacist or anticoagulant specialist not take herbal medicineswarfarin isn’t recommended for pregnant women who are given heparin injections for the full length of treatment.rivaroxaban is a medication recommended by the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) as a possible treatment for adults with dvt, or to help prevent recurrent dvt and pulmonary embolism.rivaroxaban comes in tablet form. it’s a type of anticoagulant known as a directly acting oral anticoagulant (doac). it prevents blood clots forming by inhibiting a substance called factor xa and restricting the formation of thrombin (an enzyme that helps blood clot).treatment usually lasts 3 months and involves taking rivaroxaban twice a day for the first 21 days and then once a day until the end of the course.read thenice guidance about rivaroxabannice also recommends apixaban as a possible method of treatment and prevention for dvt and pulmonary embolism.like rivaroxaban, apixaban is a doac that’s taken orally as a tablet, and prevents blood clots forming by hindering factor xa and restricting the formation of thrombin.treatment usually lasts at least 3 months and involves taking apixaban twice a day.read thenice guidance about apixabanwearing compression stockings helps prevent calf pain and swelling, and lowers the risk of ulcers developing after having dvt.they can also help prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. this is damage to leg tissue caused by the increase in venous pressure that occurs when a vein is blocked by a clot and blood is diverted to the outer veins.after having dvt, stockings should be worn every day for at least 2 years. this is because symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome may develop several months or even years after having a dvt.compression stockings should be fitted professionally and your prescription should be reviewed every 3 to 6 months. the stockings need to be worn all day but can be taken off before going to bed or in the evening while you rest with your leg raised. a spare pair of compression stockings should also be provided.your healthcare team will usually advise you to walk regularly once compression stockings have been prescribed. this can help prevent symptoms of dvt returning and may help to improve or prevent complications of dvt, such as post-thrombotic syndrome.as well as wearing compression stockings, you might be advised to raise your leg whenever you’re resting. this helps to relieve the pressure in the veins of the calf and stops blood and fluid pooling in the calf itself.when raising your leg, make sure your foot is higher than your hip. this will help the returning blood flow from your calf. putting a cushion underneath your leg while you’re lying down should help raise your leg above the level of your hip.you can also slightly raise the end of your bed to ensure that your foot and calf are slightly higher than your hip.read more aboutpreventing dvtalthough anticoagulant medicines and compression stockings are usually the only treatments needed for dvt, inferior vena cava (ivc) filters may be used as an alternative. this is usually because anticoagulant treatment needs to be stopped, isn’t suitable, or isn’t working.ivc filters are small mesh devices that can be placed in a vein. they trap large fragments of a blood clot and stop it travelling to the heart and lungs. they can be used to help prevent blood clots developing in the legs of people diagnosed with: dvt pulmonary embolism multiple severe injuriesivcs can be placed in the vein permanently, or newer types of filters can be placed temporarily and removed after the risk of a blood clot has decreased.the procedure to insert an ivc filter is carried out using alocal anaesthetic(where you’re awake but the area is numb). a small cut is made in the skin and a catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted into a vein in the neck or groin area. the catheter is guided using anultrasound scan. the ivc filter is then inserted through the catheter and into the vein.the 2 main complications of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) are pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome.a pulmonary embolism is the most serious complication of dvt. it happens when a piece of blood clot (dvt) breaks off and travels through your bloodstream to your lungs, where it blocks one of the blood vessels. in severe cases this can be fatal.if the clot is small, it might not cause any symptoms. if it’s medium-sized, it can cause chest pain andbreathing difficulties. a large clot can cause the lungs to collapse, resulting inheart failure, which can be fatal.about one in 10 people with an untreated dvt develops a severe pulmonary embolism.if you’ve had a dvt, you may develop long-term symptoms in your calf known as post-thrombotic syndrome. this affects around 20-40% of people with a history of dvt.if you have dvt, the blood clot in the vein of your calf can divert the flow of blood to other veins, causing an increase in pressure. this can affect the tissues of your calf and lead to symptoms, including: calf pain swelling a rash ulcers on the calf(in severe cases)when a dvt develops in your thigh vein, there’s an increased risk of post-thrombotic syndrome occurring. it’s also more likely to occur if you’re overweight or if you’ve had more than one dvt in the same leg.if you’re admitted to hospital or planning to go into hospital for surgery, your risk of developing a blood clot while you’re there will be assessed.surgery and some medical treatments can increase your risk of developing dvt – seecauses of dvtfor more information.if you’re thought to be at risk of developing dvt, your healthcare team can take a number of measures to prevent a blood clot forming.if you’re going into hospital to have an operation, and you’re taking thecombined contraceptive pillorhormone replacement therapy (hrt), you’ll be advised to temporarily stop taking your medication four weeks before your operation.similarly, if you’re taking medication to prevent blood clots, such asaspirin, you may be advised to stop taking it one week before your operation.there’s less risk of getting dvt when having alocal anaestheticcompared with ageneral anaesthetic. your doctor will discuss whether it’s possible for you to have a local anaesthetic.there are a number of things your healthcare team can do to help reduce your risk of getting dvt while you’re in hospital.for example, they’ll make sure you have enough to drink so you don’t becomedehydrated, and they’ll also encourage you to move around as soon as you’re able to.depending on your risk factors and individual circumstances, a number of different medications can be used to help prevent dvt. for example: anticoagulant medicines – such as dabigatran etexilate or fondaparinux sodium, which are often used to help prevent blood clots after certain types of surgery, including orthopaedic surgery low molecular weight heparin (lmwh) – often used in many cases to help prevent blood clots, including during and shortly after pregnancy unfractionated heparin (ufh) – often used in people with severe kidney impairment or establishedkidney failurecompression stockings or compression devices are also commonly used to help keep the blood in your legs circulating.compression stockings are worn around your feet, lower legs and thighs, and fit tightly to encourage your blood to flow more quickly around your body.compression devices are inflatable and work in the same way as compression stockings, inflating at regular intervals to squeeze your legs and encourage blood flow.your healthcare team will usually advise you to walk regularly after you’ve been prescribed compression stockings. keeping mobile can help prevent thesymptoms of dvtreturning and may help prevent or improvecomplications of

in your body, which affects the way it functions.water makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. it lubricates the joints and eyes, aids digestion, flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy.some of the early warning signs of dehydration include: feeling thirsty and lightheaded a dry mouth tiredness having dark coloured, strong-smelling urine passing urine less often than

asdiabetesoralcoholism athletes – they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periodsif you’re dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. these are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts.if you’re finding it difficult to keep water down because you’re vomiting, try drinking small amounts more frequently.infants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn’t be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. this is because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems.instead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration

the result of an illness, such asgastroenteritis, where fluid is lost through persistent bouts ofdiarrhoeaand vomiting.you can also become dehydrated if you sweat excessively after a fever, exercise, or carrying out heavy, manual work in hot conditions.in these situations, it’s important to drink regularly to replace lost fluids. it doesn’t necessarily need to be hot for you to lose a significant amount of fluid from sweating.children and teenagers are particularly at risk because they may ignore thesymptoms of dehydration, or not know how to recognise and treat them.dehydration can also occur as a result of drinking too muchalcohol. alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you wee more.the headache associated with a hangover indicates that your body is dehydrated. you should try to drink plenty of water when you have been drinking alcohol.if you have diabetes, you’re at risk of becoming dehydrated because you have high levels of glucose in your bloodstream. your kidneys will try to get rid of the glucose by creating more urine, so your body becomes dehydrated from going to the toilet more frequently.read more about the differenttypes of diabetesthe groups of people most at risk of dehydration are: babies and infants – their low body weight makes them sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss older people – they may be less aware they’re becoming dehydrated and need to drink fluids people with a long-term health condition – such asdiabetesor alcoholism athletes – they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periodsit’s possible to become overhydrated while exercising. this is known as hyponatremia and it’s caused by low sodium (salt) levels in the blood. it can occur if too much water is drunk over a short period of time.hyponatremia sometimes affects athletes whose blood sodium level is reduced through sweat and then diluted by drinking large amounts of water.symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, vomiting and headache. in serious cases, the brain can swell, causing confusion, seizures, coma and, in rare cases, death.the best way to treat dehydration is to rehydrate the body by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, diluted squash or diluted fruit juice.a sweet drink can help to replace lost sugar, and a salty snack can help to replace lost salt.if your baby is dehydrated, take them to see your gp as soon as possible. they’ll be able to recommend appropriate treatments, such as those outlined below.give your baby plenty of liquids, such as breastmilk or formula. it can often be better to give them smaller amounts of fluid more frequently.don’t dilute your baby’s formula (if you use it). babies who are formula-fed and those on solids can be given extra water.avoid giving your baby fruit juice, particularly if they have diarrhoea and vomiting, because it can make it worse.giving your baby regular sips (a few times an hour) of oral rehydration solution (ors) in addition to their usual feed (breastmilk, formula milk and water) will help to replace lost fluids, salts and sugars.infants and children who are dehydrated shouldn’t be given solely water, because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body and make the problem worse. instead, they should have diluted squash or a special ors (see below).if you or your child is finding it difficult to hold down fluids because of vomiting, take smaller amounts more frequently. you may find it easier to use a spoon or a syringe to give your child small amounts of fluid.read more aboutvomiting in adultsandvomiting in children and babieswhen you’re dehydrated, you lose sugar and salts, as well as water. drinking a rehydration solution will enable you to re-establish the right balance of body fluids. the solution should contain a mixture of potassium and sodium salts, as well as glucose or starch.there are several different rehydration products available over the counter from pharmacies or on prescription from your gp, including solutions that are suitable for infants and children.ask your gp or pharmacist for advice about the most suitable rehydration solution for you or your child.seek immediate medical help if you suspect someone is severely dehydrated (seesymptoms of severe dehydration).they may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. in particular, babies, infants and elderly people will need urgent treatment if they become dehydrated.fluid may be given up the nose using a nasogastric tube or using a saline drip into a vein (intravenously). this will provide essential nutrients faster than using solutions that you drink.if you have had bowel surgery, some rehydration solutions may not contain enough salt. in this instance, you will need a higher-strength solution. your gp or surgeon can recommend a suitable rehydration solution for you.you should drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated.most of the time, you can prevent dehydration by drinking water regularly throughout the day. be guided by your thirst, but be aware that in hot weather, when exercising and during illness, you should drink more.mild dehydration can be relieved by drinking more water and diluted fruit squash. if necessary, you can purchase oral rehydration solutions (ors) from a pharmacy. as a guide, passing pale or clear-coloured urine (wee) is a good sign that you’re well hydrated.if you’re active, or if the weather is particularly hot, there’s a greater risk that you will become dehydrated. to prevent becoming dehydrated, you should increase your fluid intake.as different people sweat at different rates, it’s very difficult to provide specific recommendations about how much fluid you should drink. however, you should drink more than normal while exercising, and it’s particularly important to keep well hydrated if you’re exercising in warm conditions. this is because you will sweat more and fluid will be lost from your body more rapidly.rarely, drinking more fluid than your body can process can reduce the amount of sodium (salt) in your blood. this can lead to a serious and potentially fatal condition called hyponatremia. if you start to feel discomfort and bloating from drinking, stop drinking and allow time to recover.if you, your child or someone you are caring for is ill, particularly with a fever, vomiting ordiarrhoea, there’s a high risk of becoming dehydrated, so it’s important to start replacing fluid as soon as possible.there are no specific recommendations regarding the amount of water or other fluids that children need.however, it’s important for children to replace lost fluid, to prevent dehydration. like adults, children lose more water when they are in hotter climates and when they are physically active.you should give your child healthy drinks as part of an overallhealthy, balanced diet. nice: diarrhoea and vomiting in children under five (1)',\n",

       " 'Dementia with Lewy bodies': 'dementia with lewy bodies, also known as lewy body dementia, is a common form of dementia estimated to affect more than 100,000 people in the uk.the term “dementia” describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) associated with gradual death of brain cells. it’s rare in anyone younger than 65.symptoms usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years.people with dementia with lewy bodies not only experience problems with memory and judgement, like those withalzheimer’s disease, but are also likely to have difficulties with concentration and visual perception (recognising objects and making judgements about where they are in space).they may experience: slowed movement, stiff limbs, and tremors recurrent visual hallucinations (seeing things that aren’t there) sleep disturbances, including sleepiness during the day fainting, unsteadiness, andfallspeople with the condition tend to swing from a state of alertness to drowsiness or staring into space. these extreme changes may be unpredictable and happen from hour to hour or day to day.read more about thesymptoms of dementia with lewy bodiesdementia with lewy bodies is caused by deposits of an abnormal protein called lewy bodies inside brain cells. these deposits, which are also found in people withparkinson’s disease, build up in areas of the brain responsible for things such as memory and muscle movement.it’s not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain, but it’s thought they disrupt the brain’s normal functions by interfering with chemical signals transmitted from one brain cell to another.dementia with lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although there have been reports of rare cases that seem to run in families.if you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it’s a good idea to see your gp. if you’re worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment, and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.your gp can do some simple checks to see if there is chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist clinic if necessary.at one of these clinics, you will be asked about your symptoms and have a physical check-up and memory test. you may also haveblood testsand brain scans.the results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by dementia with lewy bodies, another type of dementia, or something else entirely.read more abouthow dementia with lewy bodies is diagnosedthere is no cure for dementia with lewy bodies or any medication that will slow it down.however, a few different medicines can be effective in controlling some of the symptoms. in particular, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (used to treatalzheimer’s disease) have been shown to improve symptoms such as hallucinations and confusion in some people.supportive treatments – such as physiotherapy,occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy – can help improve any problems with movement, everyday tasks, and communication.psychological therapies and specificdementia activities, such as memory cafés, can also help with memory loss, confusion, and feelings of disorientation.read more abouttreating dementia with lewy bodieshow quick dementia with lewy bodies progresses varies from person to person. home-based help will be needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home.the average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that of alzheimer’s disease – around five to eight years. however, as with alzheimer’s disease, this can be highly variable.if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you are not alone. the nhs, social services, and voluntary organisations will be able to provide advice and support to help you and your family.the symptoms of dementia with lewy bodies usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of a few years.like other forms of dementia, the condition causes problems with: thinking speed language understanding judgement memory (although significant memory loss may not occur until later on)people with dementia with lewy bodies may also have other symptoms that can help distinguish it from other types of dementia, such as: extreme swings between alertness and confusion or drowsiness, which may happen unexpectedly and change from hour to hour or day to day slow movement, stiff limbs, and tremors (as seen inparkinson’s disease), which cause shuffling when walking seeing or hearing things that aren’t real (hallucinations), which can range from pleasant to distressing

because many of the symptoms of dementia can also be caused by other conditions.for dementia with lewy bodies to be diagnosed correctly, you will have a number of tests and assessments, including: an assessment of your symptoms – for example, whether you have typicalsymptoms of dementia with lewy bodies a full assessment of your mental abilities a physical examination a review of the medication you are taking a range of tests, includingblood tests, to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as avitamin b12 deficiency brain scans, such as acomputerised tomography (ct) scanor

brain and nervous system), an elderly care physician, or a psychiatrist with experience of treating dementia.the mini mental state examination (mmse) is widely used to help test mental ability.the mmse can be used to assess a number of different mental abilities, including: short- and long-term memory attention span concentration language and communication skills ability to plan ability to understand instructionsthe mmse involves a series of tasks, which together carry a maximum score of 30 points. example tasks include: memorising a short list of objects and then repeating the list

which improves the ability of the brain cells to send signals to each other.common side effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors include feeling and being sick,diarrhoea,headaches, fatigue (extreme tiredness), and muscle cramps.other medications that may help control some of the symptoms of dementia with lewy bodies include: levodopa (a medication used to treatparkinson’s disease) can help

       " 'Depression': \"everyone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy. depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time.while some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it’s actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. it impacts people of all genders and ages – including children. studies show that around 4% of children in the uk between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious.with the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.depression has a range of different symptoms, and it can affect everybody differently. the symptoms include feeling very tearful, feeling hopelessness and sadness, and losing interest in things you enjoyed before. it’s also common for people with depression to have symptoms ofanxiety.physical symptoms happen with depression too – these can include feeling tired all the time, getting poor sleep, losing your sex drive, losing your appetite, and feeling aches and pains.if the symptoms are mild, you might simply experience a persistent low mood. it’s common to feel stressed, sad or anxious during difficult times in your life, and a low mood can get better after a short time, rather than being a symptom of depression.learn more about low mood and depressionhere.severe symptoms of depression can make people feel suicidal – as if life is no longer worth living. read more about depression symptomshere.big changes in your life, like bereavement, losing a job, or even having a baby, can cause symptoms of depression. you’re also more likely to experience depression if you have a family history of depression. however, it’s also possible to become depressed without there being an obvious reason.you can learn more about depression causeshere.symptoms of depression can be very different from person to person. however, as a general rule, if you are depressed you feel hopeless, sad and lacking interest in things that used to make you feel happy.depression symptoms are bad enough to interfere with work, social life and family life, and can persist for weeks or months.doctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is: mild depression – it has some impact on daily life moderate depression – it has a significant impact on your daily life severe depression – this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to daya few people with severe depression may have symptoms

doing poorly at work difficulties with your family or home lifeit’s not always possible to tell that you’re having symptoms of depression right away – it can start and progress gradually. a lot of people don’t realise they’re ill and try to carry on and cope with their symptoms. sometimes it takes a friend or family member to notice that there’s a problem.depression and grief have a lot of the same features, and it can be hard to tell them apart. however, they’re different in many important ways. depression is an illness – grief is a completely natural response to loss.if you’re grieving, you may find your feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but it’s still possible to enjoy things in life and look forward to the future.people with depression feel sad persistently, find it difficult to be positive about the future, and don’t get enjoyment from anything.learn more about the differences between grief and depressionhere.there are different types of depression, and there are some conditions where depression is a symptom. these conditions include: bipolar disorder– people with bipolar disorder, which is also known as “manic depression”, experience times of depression, where the symptoms are similar to clinical depression. they also go through phases when they have excessively high moods (known as “mania”). bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour like unsafe sex, spending sprees and gambling. seasonal affective disorder (sad)is also called “winter depression”. it’s depression that is related to weather, usually winter, so it happens seasonally. postnatal depressionhappens to some women after they’ve had a baby. it’s treated similarly to other types of depression, with antidepressant medication and talking therapy.learn more about how depression is diagnosedhere.depression doesn’t have one single cause – it can have a range of triggers, and there are many different reasons a person can develop the condition. some people are affected after a stressful life event, like a bereavement or divorce. other people experience depression related to illness, job loss, or money worries.different reasons can combine and trigger depression. if you’re feeling low after a job loss or health issues, and then experience something traumatic, like a bereavement, you can develop depression.it’s common to hear about depression being brought on by a “downward spiral” – one thing causing other problems that combine to cause depression. for example, losing your job could make you feel sad, so you spend less time with family and friends and maybe drink more alcohol. these things all make you feel worse, which triggers depression.there are studies that suggest people are more likely to become depressed when they get older. there’s also evidence that depression is more common for people whose economic and social circumstances are difficult.long-lasting or life-threatening conditions likecancerorcoronary heart diseasecan put you at higher risk of developing depression.many people don’t know that head injuries can cause depression, and asevere head injurycan lead to emotional problems and mood swings.underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can happen as a result of immune system problems. it’s also possible, although rare, for a minor head injury to damage the pituitary gland. this is a gland the size of a pea which sits at the base of the brain and produces hormones that stimulate the thyroid. damage to the pituitary gland can cause symptoms, including severe tiredness and a lack of interest in sex, which can then cause people to develop depression.“drowning your sorrows” is actually a bad idea when it comes to depression. alcohol is categorised as a “strong depressant” which can make depression worse, and drinking or taking drugs to cope can lead to a downward spiral by having a negative affect on other parts of your life.there’s evidence that cannabis can cause depression, particularly in teenagers, even if it helps you relax.there are a number of things that can lead to developing depression. stressful events – big changes in your life, like bereavement, the end of a relationship or the loss of a job, can be difficult to deal with. when these things happen, it’s important to keep seeing friends and family instead of trying to deal with problems alone – this increases your risk of developing depression. giving birth – pregnancy and birth can make some people vulnerable to depression. postnatal depression can happen as the result of physical changes, hormonal changes, and the responsibility of taking care of a new baby. loneliness – your risk of depression gets higher if you aren’t in contact or spending time with family and friends. personality – some personality traits can put you at a higher risk of developing depression. these include low-self esteem or a habit of criticising yourself too much. these personality traits can come from your genes, which you get from your parents, or they can be as a result of experiences in your early life. family history – it’s more likely for someone to develop depression if a family member, like a sibling or parent, has experienced it before.there’s no physical test for depression.if you experience depression symptoms most of the day, every day, for more than two weeks, you should visit your gp. this is especially important if: you have symptoms of depression that aren’t getting any better you have thoughts of self-harm orsuicide your work, relationships with friends and family, or interests are affected by your moodit can be hard for people with depression to imagine that anything can help them – but the sooner you seek help, the sooner the symptoms start to get better.your gp may examine you and perform blood or urine tests to make sure there isn’t another condition causing your depression symptoms, like anunderactive thyroid.when you see your gp, they’ll try to find out if you have depression by asking you questions. these are likely to be about your health, how you’re feeling, and how that is affecting you mentally and physically.telling your doctor your symptoms and the affect they are having on you will help your gp to tell if you have depression, and how severe the condition is. it’s important to be as open as possible.your conversation with your gp will be confidential. this rule can only be broken if your gp thinks there is a significant risk of harm to you or others, and that telling a family member or carer would make that risk lower.the first place to go is your gp – they will refer to you local talking treatments for depression that are available on the nhs.you may also have the option to self-refer, depending on where you live, so you can go directly to a professional therapist if you’d rather not talk to your gp.there are a number of talking therapies for depression.cbt helps you make sense of your thoughts and behaviour and the affect they have on you. part of it’s recognising that past events may have played a part in making you who you are, but the main focus is changing how you feel, behave and think now.you can use cbt to learn how to overcome negative thoughts – this can help you to tackle feelings of hopelessness, for example.most people have a course of six to eight cbt sessions that goes over 10 to 12 weeks. sessions are one-to-one, between you and a cbt-trained counsellor. you might also be offered group cbt.this type of cbt is done using a computer instead of face-to-face with the counsellor. it should be supported by a healthcare professional – your gp may prescribe it, and you might have to use the computer in the gp surgery to access it. ccbt involves a series of weekly sessions.ipt is focused on your relationships with people around you, and problems that you might be having with them. these can include problems communicating, or dealing with a bereavement.there’s evidence that suggests ipt can be as effective for depression as cbt or medication, but more research needs to be done.this is also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy. you’ll work with a therapist who encourages you to say whatever you’re thinking. this helps you to find hidden patterns and meanings in your words and behaviour that could be contributing to your depression.read more about psychotherapyhere.counselling is a type of therapy that works really well if you have good mental wellbeing overall but need help coping with a crisis that’s currently going on in your life. these can include anger, bereavement, infertility, relationship problems, job loss and serious illness.on the nhs, counselling usually takes place over six to 12 sessions, each an hour long. the sessions are confidential.a counsellor helps you to think about what’s going on in your life and find new ways of dealing with the problems. they’ll offer practical advice, support you, and help you find solutions, but they don’t tell you what to do.antidepressantsare medicines that treat depression symptoms. there are almost 30 different types of antidepressant that can be prescribed to you.most people who have moderate or severe depression notice improvement when they take antidepressants, but this isn’t the case for everyone. one type of antidepressant might not work for you, but another one could. it can take two or more different treatments to find the right one for you.side effects vary between different people and different antidepressants, but the different types of antidepressant all work around as well as each other.if you’re prescribed antidepressants, you should see your gp or specialist nurse regularly while you first start taking the medication – every week or two for at least four weeks. this is so your treatment provider can see how the antidepressants are working.if the medication is working for you, you should continue taking them at the same dose for at least four to six months after the depression symptoms have eased. people who have had depression in the past might have to take antidepressants for up to five years, maybe longer.antidepressants aren’t addictive. however, you might have withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or miss a dose. you can read more about withdrawal symptoms below.if your gp thinks you would benefit from taking an antidepressant, you’ll usually be prescribed a modern type called aselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri). examples of commonly used ssri antidepressants are seroxat (paroxetine), prozac (fluoxetine) and cipramil (citalopram).they help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin, which is thought to be a “good mood” chemical.ssris work just as well as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects.they can, however, cause nausea and headaches, as well as a dry mouth and problems having sex. however, all these negative effects usually improve over time.some ssris aren’t suitable for children under the age of 18. research shows that the risk ofself-harmand suicidal behaviour may increase if they’re taken by under-18s. fluoxetine is the only ssri that can be prescribed for under-18s, and even then only when a specialist has given the go-ahead.this group of antidepressants is used to treat moderate to severe depression.tcas, which includes imipramil (imipramine) and amitriptyline, have been around for longer than ssris.they work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. these both help lift your mood.they’re generally quite safe, but it’s a bad idea to smoke cannabis if you are taking tcas because it can cause your heart to beat rapidly.side effects of tcas may include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, problems passing urine, sweating, light-headedness and excessive drowsiness, but vary from person to person.the side effects usually ease after seven to 10 days, as your body gets used to the medication.new antidepressants, such as efexor (venlafaxine), cymbalta or yentreve (duloxetine) and zispin soltab (mirtazapine), work in a slightly different way from ssris and tcas.venlafaxine and duloxetine are known as snris (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors). like tcas, they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.studies have shown that an snri can be more effective than an ssri, though they’re not routinely prescribed as they can lead to a rise in blood pressure.antidepressants are not addictive in the same way that illegal drugs and cigarettes are, but when you stop taking them you may have some withdrawal symptoms, including: upset stomach flu-like symptoms anxiety dizziness vivid dreams at night sensations in the body that feel like electric shocksin most cases these are quite mild and last no longer than a week or two, but occasionally they can be quite severe. they seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine (seroxat) and venlafaxine (efexor).withdrawal symptoms occur very soon after stopping the tablets, so can easily be told apart from symptoms of depression relapse, which tend to occur after a few weeks.there is a range of other treatments that people are given for depression.st john’s wort is a herbal treatment that you can buy from pharmacies and health food shops. some people take it for depression. there’s some evidence that it can help the symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression, but doctors don’t recommend st john’s wort because the amount of active ingredients change depending on the brand and batch. this means that you can never be sure what kind of effect it will have.if you take st john’s wort with other medications, like anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants and the contraceptive pill, it can cause serious problems. st john’s wort can interact with the contraceptive pill and reduce its effectiveness at preventing pregnancy.you shouldn’t take st john’s wort while pregnant or breastfeeding, as we can’t be certain that it’s safe.if you have severe depression and other treatments, like medication, haven’t worked, ect might be recommended for you.when receiving ect, you will be given an anaesthetic and medication that relaxes your muscles to begin with. electrodes will be placed on your head that give an electrical “shock” to your brain.ect is given over a series of sessions, normally twice a week for three to six weeks.ect can cause side effects including nausea, headaches, aches in the muscles and memory problems.most people find that ect is good for relieving severe depression, but the beneficial effects tend to wear off when several months have passed.if you’ve tried several different antidepressants and had no improvement, your doctor may offer you a type of medication called lithium in addition to your current treatment.there are two types of lithium: lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. both are usually effective, but if you’re taking one that works for you, it’s best not to change.if the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. you’ll therefore need blood tests every three months to check your lithium levels while you’re on the medication.you’ll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic. ask your gp for advice about your diet.there’s a lot of advice available for living with depression and feeling better.you can find support and insight by talking about depression with another person or a group. according to research, talking can help you to recover and deal better with stress.if you don’t feel comfortable talking about your symptoms and feelings with other people, you can write about how you feel or use poetry or art to express yourself – doing this can also help you to feel better.it might feel like cigarettes and alcohol are helpful, but in the long run they can make you feel worse.if you have depression it’s especially important to be careful when it comes to cannabis. research has shown there’s a strong connection between mental health problems and cannabis use.according to the evidence, if you smoke cannabis while dealing with depression: your symptoms get worse you feel less interested in things you’re more likely to have earlier and more frequent relapses of depression you’re less likely to recover fully from depression you feel more tired you won’t respond as well to antidepressants you’re more likely to stop taking antidepressantsyou can get advice and support from your gp on cutting down or stopping drinking, smoking, and drug use.learn more about stopping smokingherelearn more about help to cut down or stop drinking alcoholhereyou might need to take time off work if your depression is caused by working too much, or if the symptoms are making it hard for you to do your job. however, research has shown that taking a long time off work can make depression worse, and that going back to work can help you to get better.when you’re dealing with depression it’s important to avoid as much stress, work-related and otherwise, as you can. if you’re working you might be able to change to shorter hours, or work more flexibly. this is especially true if pressure at work causes you to experience depression symptoms.the equality act means that employers need to make reasonable adjustments to make

condition is causing difficulties in your relationship with your partner, you could contact a relationship counsellor who can talk things through with both of you.when suffering from depression, men are less likely to ask for help than women. they’re also more likely to turn to drugs and alcohol to cope with the symptoms.the majority of suicide cases are linked with mental disorders, and most of them are triggered by severe depression.warning signs that someone with depression may be considering suicide are: making final arrangements, like giving away their things, making a will or saying goodbye to friends talking about death or suicide – this may be with direct statements, like “i wish i was dead”, but often depressed people talk about the subject indirectly, saying things like: “i think dead people must be happier than us” or “wouldn’t it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up” self-harm, like cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes a sudden lifting of mood, which could mean that a person has decided to commit suicide and feels better because of this decisionif you’re feeling suicidal or are in a crisis of depression, contact your gp as soon as possible. they will be able to help you.if you can’t or don’t want to contact your gp, call the samaritans on 116 123, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. alternatively, visit thesamaritans websiteor

solutions to their problemsif you feel there is an immediate danger, stay with the person or have someone else stay with them, and remove all available means of committing suicide, such as medication.over-the-counter drugs such as painkillers can be just as dangerous as prescription medication.also, remove sharp objects and poisonous household chemicals such as bleach.some people who have severe depression will also experience symptoms of psychosis – these are hallucinations and delusional thinking.depression with psychosis is known as psychotic depression.people who have severe clinical depression feel sad and hopeless for most of the day, and feel no interest in anything. they feel this way practically every day, and getting through the day feels nearly impossible for them.other symptoms include: fatigue (exhaustion) losing pleasure in things inability to concentrate difficulty making decisions sleep disturbance appetite changes feeling guilty feeling that they’re worthless having thoughts about suicide, or deathread more about the different types of depression symptomshere.moments of psychosis are known as psychotic episodes. the person experiencing a psychotic episode will have: delusions – beliefs or thoughts that are likely to be false. hallucinations – hearing, seeing or sometimes smelling, feeling or tasting things that aren’t there. hearing voices is a common type of hallucination.hallucinations and delusions almost always reflect the deeply depressed mood of the person experiencing them. they may believe they have committed a crime or that they are to blame for something.people with psychosis also commonly experience something called psychomotor agitation. people experiencing this cannot sit still or relax, and fidget all the time.the opposite symptom can also happen – psychomotor retardation can cause a person’s thoughts and the movement of their body to slow down.people who have psychotic depression are at a higher risk of thinking about suicide.we don’t fully understand what causes psychotic depression yet. however, we know that depression doesn’t have one single cause, and that the condition has a lot of different triggers.big, stressful events like divorce, serious illness, financial worries, or bereavement can trigger depression for some people.severe depression can run in families, which suggests genes might play a role in depression, but the reason some people develop psychosis as part of severe depression is not known.many people who have psychotic depression have experienced a difficult time in childhood, like a traumatic event.learn more aboutcauses of clinical depressiontreatment for psychotic depression has three main parts: medication – taking a combination ofantipsychoticsandantidepressantscan help to relieve psychosis symptoms psychological therapies – cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) is a talking therapy done one-to-one with a trained counsellor, and it has succeeded in helping some people with psychosis social support – support with social needs like employment, education and accommodationpeople with psychotic depression may have to spend some time in hospital to receive treatment.electroconvulsive therapy (ect, or electric shock treatment) is sometimes recommended if other treatments, including antidepressants, haven’t worked for severe depression.although treatment for psychotic depression is usually very effective, people with the condition still need follow-up appointments with their treatment team so they can be continuously monitored.often friends, relatives, or carers have to seek help for a person with psychotic depression. this is because people with psychosis often don’t know they’re acting and thinking strangely.if you’re worried about someone you know and think they may be experiencing psychosis, and they’ve been diagnosed with a mental health condition before, contact their community mental health team or social worker.if they’ve never shown signs of a mental health condition and you think they may be experiencing psychotic depression, contact their gp or take them to accident and emergency

       " 'Dermatitis herpetiformis': 'dermatitis herpetiformis (dh) is an autoimmune skin condition that can be linked tocoeliac disease.dh affects around 1 in 10,000 people.dh can appear at any age, but is most commonly diagnosed in those between the ages of 15 and 40.it’s more common in men than women and is rare in children.people with dh can have:the rash can affect any area of the skin but is most commonly seen on the: elbows knees buttocksthe rash usually occurs on both sides of the body, for example on both elbows.most people with dh will have the same kind of gut damage seen with coeliac disease, but may not complain of gut symptoms like: diarrhoea constipation stomach pain bloatingjust over half (60%) of people with dh don’t have gut symptoms.dh is caused by the body’s immune system reacting to a protein called gluten in foods containing wheat, barley and rye. this reaction causes a skin rash to develop.a diagnosis of dh is confirmed by a skin test called a skin biopsy. a skin biopsy is a procedure where a sample of skin is removed to be tested.as dh is strongly linked to coeliac disease, blood tests may be taken for this condition as well.during a skin biopsy test, a specialist skin doctor called a dermatologist will take a small sample of skin from an area without the rash. samples of skin taken from the area with the rash don’t always give an accurate result.the skin sample is then tested. if you test positive for dh you’ll be referred to a specialist gut doctor called a gastroenterologist to be tested for coeliac disease.to ensure an accurate skin test is taken first time, it’s important to keep eating foods with gluten before and during diagnosis.if you’ve already removed gluten from your diet, you must reintroduce it in more than one meal every day. you should do this for at least 6 weeks before having the tests.the treatment for dh is a lifelong gluten-free diet.a gluten-free diet is when all gluten-containing foods are removed from your dietgluten is found in wheat, barley and rye and sometimes people are sensitive to oats too.a gluten free diet should only start once the diagnosis of dh is given and a referral to a dietitian has been made.find out how to live with a gluten-free dietthe length of time it takes for the skin to heal varies from person to person but it can take up to 2 years or more.some patients will be given medication to help them over this period of recovery.medication will only be given to control the skin itching and blisters and doesn’t treat any other symptoms.the drug most likely to be used is called dapsone.dapsone is taken in tablet form and must be swallowed.it helps ease the itching and controls the development of blisters. it should work within a few days.if you stop taking dapsone before the gluten-free diet has taken effect, the rash will return.the most common side effect of dapsone isanaemia.less common side effects areheadachesanddepression, while nerve damage is rare.you’ll always be prescribed the lowest effective dose to help prevent these side effects.dh should be monitored once the drug dose has been reduced.some people can’t tolerate dapsone. if you’re one of these people, the following drugs can also be taken to clear the rash: sulphapyridine sulphamethoxypyridazinedh can causethe same conditions and complications as coeliac disease.some potential complications of dh include: osteoporosis certain kinds of gut cancer an increased risk of other autoimmune diseases, such astype 1 diabetesand thyroid diseaseas with coeliac disease, the risk of developing these is reduced by following a gluten-free diet. coeliac disease gluten-free diet coeliac uk: dermatitis herpetiformis',\n",
       " 'Diabetes': 'diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.there are two main types of diabetes –type 1 diabetesandtype 2 diabetes.type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. in the uk, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2.there are 4.7 million people living with diabetes in the uk. that’s more than one in 15 people in the uk who has diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed).this figure has nearly trebled since 1996, when there were 1.4 million. by 2025, it is estimated that 5 million people will have diabetes in the uk.many more people have blood glucose levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes.this is sometimes known as prediabetes. if your blood glucose level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased.it’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.you should therefore visit your gp as soon as possible if you have symptoms, such as feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual, and feeling tired all the time.it’s also advised to see your gp if you have risk factors of diabetes and are worried about developing diabetes in future.the main symptoms of diabetes are:type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over a few hours or even days.many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.the amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).when food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it’s broken down to produce energy.however, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. this is because there’s either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn’t work properly.in type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. as insulin production decreases until no more is produced, your glucose levels increase, which can seriously damage the body’s organs.type 1 diabetes usually develops before the age of 40, often during the teenage years.type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes. in the uk, it affects about 10% of all adults with diabetes.if you’re diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you’ll need insulin injections for the rest of your life.you’ll also need to pay close attention to certain aspects of your lifestyle and health to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced.for example, you’ll need toeat healthily, takeregular exerciseand carry out regular blood tests.read more aboutliving with type 1 diabetestype 2 diabetes is where the body doesn’t produce enough insulin, or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. this is known as insulin resistance.if you’re diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you may be able to control your symptoms simply by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood glucose levels.however, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, you may eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets.type 2 diabetes is often associated withobesity. obesity-related diabetes is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset diabetes because it’s more common in older people.read more aboutliving with type 2 diabeteseveryone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year by the national diabetes retinal screening service.if you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it’s not treated.screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively.read more about diabetic eye screeningduring pregnancy, all women need to make more insulin. in some women this doesn’t happen and blood glucose levels rise – typically in the middle of pregnancy onwards.diabetes diagnosed in pregnancy is known as gestational diabetes.risk of gestational diabetes is increased with the same risk factors for type 2 diabetes (increased weight, at risk ethnicity and family history of diabetes), but also if you have given birth to a baby in the past who was bigger than expected.for most women with gestational diabetes, blood glucose levels will return to normal after pregnancy. although you will have an increased risk of developing diabetes in later life.if you’re worried about gestational diabetes then discuss this with your midwife.blood glucose control is also very important for women with diabetes before pregnancy (type 1, type 2 or other kinds). if you’re planning a pregnancy or are in the early stages of pregnancy, it’s important to discuss this with your gp, midwife or hospital clinic.in addition to type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes, there are a range of other types of diabetes.these types of diabetes are much rarer, with about 2% of people having them. the rare types of diabetes include: different types of monogenic diabetes cystic fibrosis-related diabetes diabetes caused by rare syndromes diabetes caused by certain medications such as steroids and antipsychotics diabetes caused by surgery or hormonal imbalancesunfortunately, many people with rarer types of diabetes are misdiagnosed leading to delays in getting the right

red spots or bumps on the skin. these then quickly join up to form larger pink, red or brown patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size.initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. they also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night.over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. the centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken forringworm.you may just have one patch of discoid eczema, but most people have several

aboutdiagnosing discoid eczema.the cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may occur as a result of having particularly dry skin.dry skin means your skin cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it, which could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate (damage) your skin.it’s important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin.contact dermatitis, a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may therefore have a role in discoid eczema.some people with discoid eczema also have a history ofatopic eczema, which often occurs in people who are prone toasthmaandhay fever. however, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families.an outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as aninsect biteor aburn.some medicines may also be associated with discoid eczema, as patches of eczema can appear in people taking: interferon and ribavirin – when they are used together to treathepatitis c tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) blockers – which are used to treat

environments may make your symptoms better.there is no simple cure for discoid eczema, but there are medications that can help ease the symptoms.these include: emollients – to use all the time soap substitutes – to replace irritating soaps and cleaning products topical corticosteroids– for flare-ups oral corticosteroids– for severe flare-ups antibiotics– for infected eczema antihistamines – for severe itchingthere are many different preparations for each type of medication and it is worth taking time with your pharmacist to find the best one for you.a range of emollient products, soap substitutes and some topical corticosteroids can be bought from pharmacies without a prescription. some of them are cheaper to buy this way than with a prescription.ask your pharmacist for advice on the different products and how to use them. see your gp if your eczema does not improve after using an over-the-counter preparation.there are also some self-help tips that may help to control symptoms of discoid eczema, such as: avoiding soaps and detergents, including liquid soaps, bubble bath, shower gels and wet wipes – even if these do not obviously irritate your skin; you should use an emollient soap substitute instead protecting your skin from minor cuts (for example, by wearing gloves) as they may trigger discoid eczema taking daily lukewarm baths or showers – using an emollient when washing may reduce your symptoms, and remember to apply your treatments soon afterwards not scratching the patches – keeping your hands clean and your fingernails short may help reduce the risk of skin damage or infection from unintentional scratching making sure you use and apply your treatments as instructed by your gp or pharmacistif you suspect your skin is infected, for example because there is excessive weeping or tenderness in the patches of eczema, see your gp. infection can spread quickly, and the use of topical corticosteroid creams can mask or further spread the infection.emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. they are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.several different emollients are available. you may need to try a few to find one that works for you. you may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as: an ointment for very dry skin a cream or lotion for less dry skin an emollient to use instead of soap an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your bodythe difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. creams are somewhere in between.creams and lotions tend to be more suitable for red, inflamed (swollen) areas of skin. ointments are more suitable for areas of dry skin that are not inflamed.if you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. if this is the case, your gp will be able to prescribe another product.use your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms as they can help limit the return of your condition. many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school.to apply the emollient: use a large amount don’t rub it in, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows instead for very dry skin, apply the emollient every two to three hours after a bath or shower, gently dry the skin and then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moistif you are exposed to irritants at work, make sure you apply emollients regularly during and after work.don’t share emollients with other people.occasionally, some emollients can irritate the skin. if you have discoid eczema, your skin will be sensitive and can react to certain ingredients in over-the-counter emollients. if your skin reacts to the emollient, stop using it and speak to your gp, who can recommend an alternative product.emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.to treat the patches of discoid eczema, your gp may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin) to reduce the inflammation.you may be concerned about using medication that contains steroids. however, corticosteroids are not the same as anabolic steroids, which are sometimes used by bodybuilders and athletes. when used as instructed by your pharmacist or doctor, corticosteroids are a safe and effective treatment for discoid eczema.there are different strengths of topical corticosteroids that can be prescribed depending on the severity of your eczema. discoid eczema usually needs a stronger type of corticosteroid than other types of eczema.you might be prescribed a cream to be used on visible areas, such as face and hands, and an ointment to be used at night or for more severe flare-ups.when using corticosteroids, apply the treatment accurately to the affected areas. unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, you should follow directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the corticosteroid.do not apply the corticosteroid more than twice a day. most people will only have to apply it once a day.to apply the topical corticosteroid, take the following steps: apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid, until the emollient has soaked into your skin apply a good amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area use the topical corticosteroid until the inflammation has cleared up, unless otherwise advised by your gpspeak to your prescriber if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved.topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them. in rare cases, they may also cause: thinning of the skin changes in skin colour acne(spots) increased hair growthmost of these side effects will improve once treatment stops.generally, using a stronger topical corticosteroid, or using a large amount of topical corticosteroid, will increase your risk of getting side effects. for this reason, you should use the weakest and smallest amount possible to control your symptoms.if you have a severe flare-up, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid tablets to take for up to a week.if corticosteroid tablets are taken often or for a long time, they can cause a number of side effects, such as: reduced growth rate in children high blood pressure(hypertension) osteoporosis(brittle bones) diabetesfor this reason, your doctor is unlikely to prescribe repeat courses of corticosteroid tablets without referring you to a specialist.if your eczema becomes infected, you may also be prescribed an antibiotic.if you have an extensive area of infected eczema, you may be prescribed an antibiotic to take by mouth. this is most commonly flucloxacillin, which is usually taken for one week. if you are allergic to penicillin, you might be given an alternative such as clarithromycin.if you have a small amount of infected eczema, you will normally be prescribed a topical antibiotic, such as fusidic acid. this means the medicine is applied directly to the affected area of skin, in the form of an ointment or cream.some topical antibiotics are available in creams or ointments that also contain topical corticosteroids.topical antibiotics should normally be used for up to 2 weeks as necessary.antihistamines are a type of medicine that work by stopping the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. your body often releases histamine when it comes into contact with an irritant. histamine can cause a wide range of symptoms, including sneezing, watery eyes and itching.antihistamines may be prescribed during flare-ups of discoid eczema to cope with the symptom of itching, particularly if it is interfering with your sleep. however, they will not treat the damaged skin.many older types of antihistamines can make you drowsy, which can be useful if your symptoms affect the quality of your sleep. otherwise, ask your pharmacist or gp to recommend one of the more modern “non-sedating” antihistamines.if the treatments prescribed by your gp are not successfully controlling your symptoms, they may refer you for assessment and treatment by a dermatologist (specialist in treating skin conditions).further treatments that may be available from your dermatologist include: phototherapy – where the affected area of skin is exposed to ultraviolet (uv) light to help reduce inflammation bandaging – where medicated dressings are applied to your skin immunosuppressant therapy – medicines that reduce inflammation by suppressing your immune system varicose eczema atopic eczema national eczema society:

       " 'Diverticular disease and diverticulitis': 'diverticular disease and diverticulitis are related digestive conditions that affect the large intestine (colon).in diverticular disease, small bulges or pockets (diverticula) develop in the lining of the intestine. diverticulitis is when these pockets become inflamed or infected.symptoms of diverticular disease include: lower abdominal pain feeling bloatedthe majority of people with diverticula will not have any symptoms; this is known as diverticulosis.symptoms of diverticulitis tend to be more serious and include: more severe abdominal pain, especially on the left side high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above diarrhoea or frequent bowel movementsread more about thesymptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.‘diverticula’ is the medical term used to describe the small bulges that stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon).diverticula are common and associated with ageing. the large intestine becomes weaker with age, and the pressure of hard stools passing through the large intestine is thought to cause the bulges to form.read more about thecauses of diverticula.it’s estimated that 5% of people have diverticula by the time they are 40 years old, and at least 50% of people have them by the time they are 80 years old.1 in 4 people who develop diverticula will experience symptoms, such as abdominal pain.having symptoms associated with diverticula is known as diverticular disease.diverticulitis describes infection that occurs when bacteria becomes trapped inside one of the bulges, triggering more severe symptoms.diverticulitis can lead to complications, such as an abscess next to the intestine.read more about thecomplications of diverticulitis.ahigh-fibre dietcan often ease symptoms of diverticular disease, andparacetamolcan be used to relieve pain – other painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen are not recommended for regular use, as they can cause stomach upsets. speak to your gp if paracetamol alone is not working.mild diverticulitis can usually be treated at home withantibioticsprescribed by your gp. more serious cases may need hospital treatment to prevent and treat complications.surgery to remove the affected section of the intestine is sometimes recommended if there have been serious complications, although this is rare.read more abouttreating diverticular disease and diverticulitis.diverticular disease is one of the most common digestive conditions.both sexes are equally affected by diverticular disease and diverticulitis, although the condition is more likely to appear at a younger age (under 50) in men than in women. overall, symptoms of diverticulitis are most likely to occur in people over 70 years old.diverticular disease is often described as a ‘western disease’ because the rates are high in european and north american countries, and low in african and asian countries.a combination of genetics and diet is thought to be the reason for this and the fact that people in western countries tend to eat less fibre.people aged 50 to 70 who eat a high-fibre diet (25g a day) have a 40% lower chance of admission to hospital with complications of diverticular disease – compared to others in their age range with the lowest amount of dietary fibre.symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis include abdominal pain, bloating and a change in normal bowel habits.if diverticula have been discovered during a camera test for another reason (colonoscopy) or during a ct scan, you may be worried about what this means.however, if you have never had abdominal pain or bouts of diarrhoea, there is a 70% to 80% chance that you will never have any symptoms from them.diverticula are extremely common over the age of 70 and they do not increase your risk of cancer. it’s thought that a high-fibre diet is likely to reduce the risk of any symptoms developing.the most common symptom of diverticular disease is intermittent (stop-start) pain in your lower abdomen (stomach), usually in the lower left-hand side.the pain is often worse when you are eating, or shortly afterwards. passing stools and breaking wind (flatulence) may help relieve the pain.other long-term symptoms of diverticular disease include: a change in your normal bowel habits, such asconstipationordiarrhoea, or episodes of constipation that are followed by diarrhoea – a classic pattern is multiple trips to the toilet in the morning to pass stools like ‘rabbit pellets’ bloatinganother possible symptom of diverticular disease is bleeding dark purple blood from your rectum (back passage). this usually occurs after diarrhoea-like cramping pain, and often leads to hospital admission, but fortunately this is an uncommon complication.diverticular disease does not cause weight loss, so if you are losing weight, seeing blood in your stools or experiencing frequent bowel changes, see your gp.diverticulitis shares most of the symptoms of diverticular disease (see above). however, the pain associated with diverticulitis is constant and severe, rather than intermittent. it is most likely to occur if you have previously had symptoms of diverticular disease, and develops over a day or 2.other symptoms of diverticulitis can include: a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above a general feeling of being tired and unwell feeling sick (nausea) orbeing sick(vomiting)the pain usually starts below your belly button, before moving to the lower left-hand side of your abdomen.in asian people, the pain may move to the lower right-hand side of your abdomen. this is because east asian people tend to develop diverticula in a different part of their colon for genetic reasons.contact your gp as soon as possible if you think you have symptoms of diverticulitis.if you have symptoms of diverticular disease and the condition has previously been diagnosed, you do not usually need to contact your gp as the symptoms can be treated at home.read more about thetreatment of diverticular disease.if you have not been diagnosed with the condition, contact your gp so they can rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as: astomach ulcer pancreatitis cholecystitis bowel cancerirritable bowel syndrome (ibs) can also cause similar symptoms to diverticular disease.diverticular disease is caused by small bulges in the large intestine (diverticula) developing and becoming inflamed. if any of the diverticula become infected, this leads to symptoms of diverticulitis.the exact reason why diverticula develop is not known, but they are associated with not eating enough fibre.fibre makes your stools softer and larger, so less pressure is needed by your large intestine to push them out of your body.the pressure of moving hard, small pieces of stools through your large intestine creates weak spots in the outside layer of muscle. this allows the inner layer (mucosa) to squeeze through these weak spots, creating the diverticula.there is currently no clinical evidence to fully prove the link between fibre and diverticula. however, diverticular disease and diverticulitis are both much more common in western countries, where many people do not eat enough fibre.it is not known why only 1 in 4 people with diverticula go on to have symptoms of diverticulitis. diverticular disease may be chronic low-level diverticulitis. the symptoms are very similar toirritable bowel syndrome (ibs)and may overlap.however, factors that appear to increase your risk of developing diverticular disease include: smoking being overweight orobese having a history ofconstipation use ofnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)painkillers, such asibuprofenor naproxen having a close relative with diverticular disease, especially if they developed it under the age of 50exactly how these lead to developing diverticular disease is unclear.diverticulitis is caused by an infection of one or more of the diverticula.it is thought an infection develops when a hard piece of stool or undigested food gets trapped in one of the pouches. this gives bacteria in the stool the chance to multiply and spread, triggering an infection.diverticular disease can be difficult to diagnose from the symptoms, alone because there are other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such asirritable bowel syndrome (ibs).as a first step, your gp may recommendblood teststo rule out other conditions such ascoeliac disease(a condition caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten) orbowel cancer.in some cases, you may be offered treatment for ibs and diverticular disease at the same time.to make sure there is not a more serious cause of your symptoms, your gp may refer you for a colonoscopy, where a thin tube with a camera at the end (a colonoscope) is inserted into your rectum and guided into your colon. before the procedure begins, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels.a colonoscopy is not usually painful, but it can feel uncomfortable. you may be offered painkilling medication and a sedative beforehand to make you feel more relaxed and help reduce any discomfort.another technique for confirming the presence of diverticula is acomputerised tomography (ct scan). a ct scan uses x-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body.as with a colonoscopy, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels before you have the ct scan.unlike a regular ct scan, the colonography scan involves a tube being inserted into your rectum, which is used to pump some air up into your rectum. the ct scan is then taken with you lying on your front, and again lying on your back.you may need to have an injection of contrast dye before the scan, but this is not always necessary.if you have had a previous history of diverticular disease, your gp will usually be able to diagnose diverticulitis from your symptoms and a physical examination. a blood test may be taken, because a high number of white blood cells indicates infection. if your symptoms are mild, your gp will treat it at home and you should recover within 4 days.further tests will be needed if you have no previous history of diverticular disease.if you are unwell, your gp may refer you to hospital for blood tests and investigations. this is to look for complications of diverticulitis and to rule out other possible conditions, such as gallstones or a hernia.anultrasound scanmay be used, as well as a ct scan.a ct scan may also be used if your symptoms are particularly severe. this is to check whether a complication, such as a perforation or an abscess, has occurred.treatment options for diverticular disease and diverticulitis depend on how severe your symptoms are.most cases of diverticular disease can be treated at home.the over-the-counter painkillerparacetamolis recommended to help relieve your symptoms.painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are not recommended because they may upset your stomach and increase your risk of internal bleeding.eating a high-fibre diet may initially help to control your symptoms. some people will notice an improvement after a few days, although it can take around a month to feel the benefits fully. read more advice aboutusing diet to improve the symptoms of diverticular disease.if you haveconstipation, you may be given a bulk-forming laxative. these can cause flatulence (wind) and bloating. drink plenty of fluids to prevent any obstruction in your digestive system.heavy or constant rectal bleeding occurs in about 1 in 20 cases of diverticular disease. this can happen if the blood vessels in your large intestine (colon) are weakened by the diverticula, making them vulnerable to damage. the bleeding is usually painless, but losing too much blood can be potentially serious and may need ablood transfusion.signs that you may be experiencing heavy bleeding (aside from the amount of blood) include: feeling very dizzy mental confusion pale clammy skin shortness of breathif you suspect that you (or someone in your care) is experiencing heavy bleeding, seek immediate medical advice. contact your gp at once. if this is not possible then phonenhs 24 111 serviceor yourlocal out-of-hours service.mild diverticulitis can often be treated at home. your gp will prescribeantibioticsfor the infection and you should take paracetamol for the pain. it’s important that you finish the complete course of antibiotics, even if you are feeling better.some types of antibiotics used to treat diverticulitis can cause side effects in some people, including vomiting anddiarrhoea.your gp may recommend that you stick to a fluid-only diet for a few days until your symptoms improve. this is because trying to digest solid foods may make your symptoms worse. you can gradually introduce solid foods over the next 2 or 3 days.for the 3 to 4 days of recovery, a low-fibre diet is suggested, until you return to the preventative high-fibre diet. this is to reduce the amount of faeces (poo) your large bowel has to deal with while it is inflamed.if you have not been diagnosed with diverticular disease before, your gp may refer you for a test such as a colonoscopy or ct colonography after the symptoms have settled.if you have more severe diverticulitis, you may need to go to hospital, particularly if: your pain cannot be controlled using paracetamol you are unable to drink enough fluids to keep yourself hydrated you are unable to take antibiotics by mouth your general state of health is poor you have a weakened immune system your gp suspects complications your symptoms fail to improve after 2 days of treatment at homeif you are admitted to hospital for treatment, you are likely to receive injections of antibiotics and be kept hydrated and nourished using an intravenous drip (a tube directly connected to your vein). most people start to improve within 2 to 3 days.in the past, surgery was recommended as a preventative measure for people who had 2 episodes of diverticulitis as a precaution to prevent complications.this is no longer the case, as studies have found that in most cases, risks of serious complications from surgery (estimated to be around 1 in 100) usually outweigh the benefits.however, there are exceptions to this, such as: if you have a history of serious complications arising from diverticulitis if you have symptoms of diverticular disease from a young age (it is thought the longer you live with diverticular disease, the greater your chances of having a serious complication) if you have a weakened immune system or are more vulnerable to infectionsif surgery is being considered, discuss both benefits and risks carefully with the doctor in charge of your care.in rare cases, a severe episode of diverticulitis can only be treated with emergency surgery. this is when a hole (perforation) has developed in the bowel. this is uncommon, but causes very severe abdominal pain, which needs an emergency trip to hospital.surgery for diverticulitis involves removing the affected section of your large intestine. this is known as a colectomy. there are 2 ways this operation can be performed: an open colectomy – where the surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in your abdomen (stomach) and removes a section of your large intestine laparoscopic colectomy – a type of ‘keyhole surgery’ where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of large intestineopen colectomies and laparoscopic colectomies are thought equally effective in treating diverticulitis, and have a similar risk of complications. people who have laparoscopic colectomies tend to recover faster and have less pain after the operation.emergency surgery when the bowel has perforated is more likely to be open and may result in astomabeing formed.in some cases, the surgeon may decide your large intestine needs to heal before it can be reattached, or that too much of your large intestine has been removed to make reattachment possible.in such cases, stoma surgery provides a way of removing waste materials from your body without using all of your large intestine. it is known as ‘having a bag’ as a bag is stuck to the skin on your belly and the faeces (poo) are collected in the bag.stoma surgery involves the surgeon making a small hole in your abdomen – known as a stoma. there are 2 ways this procedure can be carried out.anileostomy– where a stoma is made in the right-hand side of your abdomen. your small intestine is separated from your large intestine and connected to the stoma, and the rest of the large intestine is sealed. you will need to wear a pouch connected to the stoma to collect waste material (poo).acolostomy– where a stoma is made in your lower abdomen and a section of your large intestine is removed and connected to the stoma. as with an ileostomy, you will need to wear a pouch to collect waste material.in most cases, the stoma will be temporary and can be removed once your large intestine has recovered from the surgery. this will depend on the situation when you had the operation. if it was an emergency operation, you may need a few months to recover before having surgery to reverse the stoma.if a large section of your large intestine is affected by diverticulitis and needs to be removed, or if you have multiple other conditions that make major surgery a risk, you may need a permanent ileostomy or colostomy.in general terms, elective (non-emergency) surgery is usually successful, although it does not achieve a complete cure in all cases. following surgery, an estimated 1 in 12 people will have a recurrence of symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.in an emergency setting, the success rate depends on how unwell you are when you require the operation.complications of diverticulitis affect 1 in 5 people with the condition. those most at risk are aged under 50.around 15% of people with diverticular disease or diverticulitis experience bleeding, which is usually painless, quick and resolves itself in 70% to 80% of cases.however, if the bleeding does not resolve itself, an emergencyblood transfusionmay be required due to excessive bleeding. if the bleeding is severe, you may need to be admitted to hospital for monitoring.diverticulitis can lead to the inflamed part of the bowel being in contact with the bladder. this may cause urinary problems, such as: pain when urinating (dysuria) needing to urinate more often than usual in rare cases, air in the urinethe most common complication of diverticulitis is an abscess outside the large intestine (colon). an abscess is a pus-filled cavity or lump in the tissue. abscesses are usually treated with a technique known as percutaneous abscess drainage (pad).a radiologist (a specialist in the use of imaging equipment, such as computerised tomography (ct) scans) uses an ultrasound or ct scanner to locate the site of the abscess.a fine needle connected to a small tube is passed through the skin of your abdomen (stomach) and into the abscess. the tube is then used to drain the pus from the abscess. a pad is performed under a local anaesthetic.depending on the size of the abscess, the procedure may need repeating several times before all the pus has been drained. if the abscess is very small – usually less than 4cm (1.5 inches) – it may be possible to treat it usingantibiotics.a fistula is another common complication of diverticulitis. fistulas are abnormal tunnels that connect 2 parts of the body together, such as your intestine and your abdominal wall or bladder.if infected tissues come into contact with each other, they can stick together. after the tissues have healed, a fistula may form. fistulas can be potentially serious as they can allow bacteria in your large intestine to travel to other parts of your body, triggering infections, such as an infection of the bladder (cystitis).fistulas are usually treated with surgery to remove the section of the colon that contains the fistula.in rare cases, an infected diverticulum (pouch in your colon) can split, spreading the infection into the lining of your abdomen (perforation). an infection of the lining of the abdomen is known as peritonitis.peritonitis can be life-threatening, and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. surgery may also be required to drain any pus that has built up, and it may be necessary to perform acolostomy.if the infection has badly scarred your large intestine, it may become partially or totally blocked. a totally blocked large intestine is a medical emergency because the tissue of your large intestine will start to decay and eventually split, leading to peritonitis.a partially blocked large intestine is not as urgent, but treatment is still needed. if left untreated, it will affect your ability to digest food and cause you considerable pain.intestinal blockage from diverticular disease is very rare. other causes, such as cancer, are more common. this is one of the reasons your gp will investigate your symptoms.in some cases, the blocked part can be removed during surgery.however, if the scarring and blockage is more extensive, a temporary or permanentcolostomymay be needed.eating a high-fibre diet may help prevent diverticular disease, and should improve your symptoms.your diet should be balanced and include at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day, plus whole grains. adults should aim to eat 18g (0.6oz) to 30g (1.05oz) of fibre a day, depending on their height and weight. your gp can provide a more specific target, based on your individual height and weight.it’s recommended that you gradually increase your fibre intake over the course of a few weeks. this will help prevent side effects associated with a high-fibre diet, such as bloating and flatulence (wind). drinking plenty of fluids will also help prevent side effects.if you have established diverticular disease, it may be suggested that you avoid eating nuts, corn and seeds due to the possibility that they could block the diverticular openings and cause diverticulitis. people usually find out themselves if these foods cause symptoms. probiotics have also been recommended, but evidence is lacking. overall, there is a lack of good quality scientific evidence on how to prevent diverticular disease.good sources of fibre include fruit vegetables nuts breakfast cereals – but check fibre content as some are very low starchy foods – such as brown bread, rice and pastaonce you have reached your fibre target, stick to it for the rest of your life, if possible.good sources of fibre in fresh fruit (plus the amount of fibre that is found in typical

       " 'Dizziness (Lightheadedness)': 'dizziness (lightheadedness) is a common symptom that’s not usually a sign of anything serious, but should be investigated by a doctor.the term “dizziness” means different things to different people – some use it to describe feeling lightheaded or off balance, while others use it to describe a feeling that their surroundings are spinning.because the symptom is quite vague and can be caused by a wide range of things, it may not always be easy to identify the underlying cause.this page explains what you should do if you feel dizzy for no apparent reason, and outlines the most common causes.your gp will want to establish exactly what you mean by dizziness, and check that you’re not actually describingvertigo– a severe type of dizziness, where you feel your surroundings are spinning or moving.they’ll also want to know: whether the dizziness started for no apparent reason, or if it followed an illness whether you have repeated episodes of dizziness and, if so, when you tend to experience these how long the dizziness lastsdizziness can sometimes be caused by an ear condition. a simple way of distinguishing between ear-related dizziness and dizziness due to other causes is to determine whether it occurs only when you’re upright or also when you’re lying down.if feeling dizzy occurs when you’re upright its probably not related to the ear. if it happens when you’re lying down, its usually caused by a viral ear infection, which can’t be treated withantibiotics.it’s a good idea to keep a diary recording when and where you feel dizzy and take it with you to your gp appointment. it’s helpful to note: what you were doing at the time you felt dizzy how long it lasted and how bad it was whether you had any other symptoms – such as fainting, vomiting, nausea, blurred vision, headache,hearing lossortinnitusif you’re taking prescription medicine, your gp will probably review this to check whether dizziness is a possible side effect. if necessary, they can prescribe a different medication for you to try.you may be referred to a specialist for further tests and investigations.the most common causes are: labyrinthitis– an inner ear infection that affects your hearing and balance, and can lead to a severe form of dizziness calledvertigo migraine– dizziness may come on before or after the headache, or even without the headache stressoranxiety– particularly if you tend to hyperventilate (breathe abnormally quickly when resting) low blood sugar level (hypoglycaemia)– which is usually seen in people withdiabetes posturalhypotension– a sudden fall in blood pressure when you suddenly sit or stand up, which goes away after lying down. this is more common in older people dehydrationor heat exhaustion – dehydration could be due to not drinking enough during exercise, or illness that causes vomiting,diarrhoeaor fever vertebrobasilar insufficiency – decreased blood flow in the back of the brain, which may be caused by the blood vessels that lead to the brain from the heart being blocked (known as atherosclerosis)less common causes include: having a severe illness or condition that affects the whole body using recreational drugs or consuming excessive amounts ofalcohol(eitherbinge drinkingor long-termalcohol misuse) certain types of prescription medicine – such asantidepressantsor blood pressure medication having a heart rhythm problem – such asatrial fibrillation (a fast, irregular heartbeat) carbon monoxide poisoning labyrinthitis headaches self-help guide: headache brain and spine foundation: dizziness and balance problems',\n",

       " 'Dry mouth': 'it’s normal to occasionally have a dry mouth if you’re dehydrated or feeling nervous. a persistently dry mouth can be a sign of an underlying problem though.you have a dry mouth and:the gp can check what the cause might be and recommend treatment for it.a dry mouth can happen when the salivary glands in your mouth do not produce enough saliva.this is often the result ofdehydration.this means you do not have enough fluid in your body to produce the saliva you need. it’s also common for your mouth to become dry if you’re feeling anxious or nervous.a dry mouth can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem or medical condition, such as: medication – many different medications can cause a dry mouth includingantidepressants, antihistamines and diuretics a blocked nose – breathing through your mouth while you sleep can cause it to dry out diabetes– a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood sugar level to become too high radiotherapyto the head and neck – this can cause the salivary glands to become inflamed (mucositis) sjögren’s syndrome– a condition where the immune system attacks and damages the salivary glandsif you contact your dentist or gp, tell them about any other symptoms you’re experiencing. also tell them about any treatments you’re having. this will help them work out why your mouth is dry.saliva plays an important role in keeping your mouth healthy. if you have a dry mouth, you may experience some other problems, such as: a burning sensation or soreness in your mouth dry lips bad breath (halitosis) a reduced or altered sense of taste mouth infections that keep coming back, such asoral thrush tooth decayandgum disease difficulty speaking, eating or swallowingit’s important to maintain goodoral hygieneif you have a dry mouth. this can reduce the risk of dental problems. you should also see a dentist regularly, so they can identify and treat any problems early on.if your doctor or dentist is able to find out what’s causing your dry mouth, treating this may help your symptoms.if medication is suspected as a cause, for example, your doctor may lower your dose or suggest trying a different treatment.some of the conditions mentioned have specific treatments, like: nasaldecongestantsfor a blocked nose insulin for diabetesthere are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms. drink plenty of cold water – take regular sips during the day and keep some water by your bed at night suck on ice cubes or ice lollies sip on cold unsweetened drinks chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free sweets use lip balm if your lips are also dry brush your teeth twice a day and use alcohol-free mouthwash – you’re more likely to get tooth decay if you have a dry mouth do not drink lots of alcohol, caffeine (such as tea and coffee) or fizzy drinks do not eat foods that are acidic (like lemons), spicy, salty or sugary do not smoke do not sleep with dentures in do not use acidic artificial saliva products if you have your own teeth do not stop taking a prescribed medicine without getting medical advice first – even if you think it might be causing your symptomsif the measures above don’t help, your dentist, gp or specialist may suggest using an artificial saliva substitute. an artificial saliva substitute will help keep your mouth moist. this may come in the form of a spray, gel or lozenge. use it as often as you need to, including before and during meals.if your dry mouth is caused by radiotherapy or sjögren’s syndrome, a medication called pilocarpine may be prescribed. this is taken as a tablet several times a day. it helps to stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva.',\n",
       " 'Dysphagia (swallowing problems)': 'dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing difficulties.some people with dysphagia have problems swallowing certain foods or liquids, while others can’t swallow at all.other signs of dysphagia include: coughingor choking when eating or drinking bringing food back up, sometimes through the nose a sensation that food is stuck in your throat or chest persistent drooling of salivaover time, dysphagia can also cause symptoms such as weight loss and repeated chest infections.you should see your gp if you have swallowing difficulties.dysphagia is usually caused by another health condition, such as: a condition that affects the nervous system, such as astroke,head injury, ordementia cancer– such asmouth canceroroesophageal cancer gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord)– where stomach acid leaks back up into the oesophagusdysphagia can also occur in children as the result of a developmental or learning disability.dysphagia can be caused by problems with the: mouth or throat, known as oropharyngeal or ‘high’ dysphagia oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach), known as oesophageal or ‘low’ dysphagiaread more about thecauses of dysphagia.treatment usually depends on the cause and type of dysphagia. the type of dysphagia you have can usually be diagnosed after testing your swallowing ability and examining your oesophagus.many cases of dysphagia can be improved with treatment, but a cure isn’t always possible. treatments for dysphagia include: speech and language therapy to learn new swallowing techniques changing the consistency of food and liquids to make them safer to swallow alternative forms of feeding, such as tube feeding through the nose or stomach surgery to widen the narrowing of the oesophagus by stretching it or inserting a plastic or metal tube (known as a stent)read more aboutdiagnosing dysphagiaandtreating dysphagia.dysphagia can sometimes lead to further problems. one of the most common problems is coughing or choking when food goes down the ‘wrong way’ and blocks your airway.if this occurs frequently, you may avoid eating and drinking because you fear choking, which can lead tomalnutritionanddehydration.some people with dysphagia have a tendency to develop chest infections, such as aspirationpneumonia, which require medical treatment.dysphagia can also affect your quality of life as it may prevent you enjoying meals and social occasions.read more about thecomplications of dysphagia.as swallowing is a complex process, there are many reasons why dysphagia can develop.the nervous system is made up of the brain, nerves and spinal cord. damage to the nervous system can interfere with the nerves responsible for starting and controlling swallowing. this can lead to dysphagia.some neurological causes of dysphagia include: astroke neurological conditions that cause damage to the brain and nervous system over time, includingparkinson’s disease,multiple sclerosis,dementia, andmotor neurone disease brain tumours myasthenia gravis– a rare condition that causes your muscles to become weakthe term ‘congenital’ refers to something you’re born with. developmental conditions affect the way you develop.congenital or developmental conditions that may cause dysphagia include: learning disabilities – where learning, understanding, and communicating are difficult cerebral palsy – a group of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination a cleft lip and palate – a common birth defect that results in a gap or split in the upper lip or roof of the mouthconditions that cause an obstruction in the throat or a narrowing of the oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to the stomach) can make swallowing difficult.some causes of obstruction and narrowing include: mouth canceror throat cancer, such aslaryngeal canceroroesophageal cancer– once these cancers are treated, the obstruction may no longer be an issue pharyngeal (throat) pouches, also known as zenker diverticulum – where a large sac develops in the upper part of the oesophagus, which reduces the ability to swallow both liquids and solids; it’s a rare condition that mainly affects older people eosinophilic oesophagitis – where a type of white blood cell known as an eosinophil builds up in the lining of the oesophagus as the result of a reaction to foods, allergens, or acid reflux; the build-up damages the lining of the oesophagus and causes swallowing difficulties radiotherapytreatment – this can cause scar tissue, which narrows the passageway in your throat and oesophagus gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord)– stomach acid can cause scar tissue to develop, narrowing your oesophagus infections, such astuberculosisorthrush– these can lead to inflammation of the oesophagus (oesophagitis)any condition that affects the muscles used to push food down the oesophagus and into the stomach can cause dysphagia, although such conditions are rare.2 muscular conditions associated with dysphagia are: scleroderma – where the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) attacks healthy tissue, leading to a stiffening of the throat and oesophagus muscles achalasia – where muscles in the oesophagus lose their ability to relax and open to allow food or liquid to enter the stomachas you get older, the muscles used for swallowing can become weaker. this may explain why dysphagia is relatively common in elderly people. treatment is available to help people with age-related dysphagia.chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)is a collection of lung conditions that make it difficult to breathe in and out properly. breathing difficulties can sometimes affect your ability to swallow.dysphagia can also sometimes develop as a complication of head or neck surgery.see your gp if you’re having any difficulty swallowing. they’ll carry out an initial assessment and may refer you for further tests and treatment.tests will help determine whether your dysphagia is the result of a problem with your mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or ‘high’ dysphagia), or your oesophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (oesophageal, or ‘low’ dysphagia).diagnosing the specific type of dysphagia can make treatment more effective and reduce your chances of developingcomplications of dysphagia, such as choking orpneumonia.your gp will want to know: how long you’ve had dysphagia whether your symptoms come and go, or are getting worse whether dysphagia has affected your ability to swallow solids, liquids, or both whether you’ve lost weightdepending on the suspected cause, you may be referred for further tests with: an ear, nose and throat (ent) specialist a speech and language therapist (slt) a neurologist – a specialist in conditions that affect the brain, nerves, and spinal cord a gastroenterologist – a specialist in treating conditions of the gullet, stomach, and intestines a geriatrician – a specialist in the care of elderly peoplea water swallow test is usually carried out by a speech and language therapist, and can give a good initial assessment of your swallowing abilities. you’ll be given 150ml of water and asked to swallow it as quickly as possible.the time it takes you to drink all of the water and the number of swallows required will be recorded. you may also be asked to swallow a soft piece of pudding or fruit.a videofluoroscopy, or modified barium swallow, is one of the most effective ways of assessing your swallowing ability and finding exactly where the problem is.anx-raymachine records a continuous moving x-ray on to video, allowing your swallowing problems to be studied in detail.you’ll be asked to swallow different types of food and drink of different consistencies, mixed with a non-toxic liquid called barium that shows up on x-rays.a videofluoroscopy usually takes about 30 minutes. you may feel sick after the test, and the barium may causeconstipation. your stools may also be white for a few days as the barium passes through your system.a nasendoscopy, sometimes also known as fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (fees), is a procedure that allows the nose and upper airways to be closely examined using a very small flexible tube known as an endoscope.the endoscope is inserted into your nose so the specialist can look down on to your throat and upper airways. it has a light and camera at the end so images of the throat can be viewed on a television screen. this allows any blockages or problem areas to be identified.fees can also be used to test for oropharyngeal dysphagia after you’re asked to swallow a small amount of test liquid (usually coloured water or milk).before the procedure, you may havelocal anaestheticspray into your nose, but because the camera doesn’t go as far as your throat, it doesn’t cause retching. the procedure is safe and usually only takes a few minutes.manometry is a procedure to assess the function of your oesophagus. it involves passing a small tube (catheter) with pressure sensors through your nose and into your oesophagus to monitor its function.the test measures the pressures within your oesophagus when you swallow, which determines how well it’s working.the 24-hour ph study involves inserting a tube into your oesophagus through your nose to measure the amount of acid that flows back from your stomach. this can help determine the cause of any swallowing difficulties.diagnostic gastroscopy, also known as diagnostic endoscopy of the stomach, or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (ogd), is an internal examination using an endoscope.the endoscope is passed down your throat and into your oesophagus, and images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen. it can often detect cancerous growths or scar tissue.read more abouttreating dysphagia.if dysphagia has affected your ability to eat, you may need a nutritional assessment to check that you’re not lacking nutrients(malnourished). this could involve: measuring your weight calculating yourbody mass index (bmi)to check whether you’re a healthy weight for your height carrying outblood testsmost swallowing problems can be treated, although the treatment you receive will depend on the type of dysphagia you have.treatment will depend on whether your swallowing problem is in the mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or ‘high’ dysphagia), or in the oesophagus (oesophageal, or ‘low’ dysphagia).the cause of dysphagia is also considered when deciding on treatment. in some cases, treating the underlying cause, such asmouth canceroroesophageal cancer, can help relieve swallowing problems.treatment for dysphagia may be managed by a group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team (mdt). your mdt may include a speech and language therapist (slt), a surgeon, and a dietitian.high dysphagia is swallowing difficulties caused by problems with the mouth or throat.it can be difficult to treat if it’s caused by a condition that affects the nervous system. this is because these problems can’t usually be corrected using medication or surgery.there are 3 main treatments for high dysphagia: swallowing therapy dietary changes feeding tubesyou may be referred to a speech and language therapist (slt) for swallowing therapy if you have high dysphagia.an slt is a healthcare professional trained to work with people with feeding or swallowing difficulties.slts use a range of techniques that can be tailored for your specific problem, such as teaching you swallowing exercises.you may be referred to a dietitian (specialist in nutrition) for advice about changes to your diet to make sure you receive a healthy, balanced diet.an slt can give you advice about softer foods and thickened fluids that you may find easier to swallow. they may also try to ensure you’re getting the support you need at meal times.feeding tubes can be used to provide nutrition while you’re recovering your ability to swallow. they may also be required in severe cases of dysphagia that put you at risk ofmalnutritionanddehydration.a feeding tube can also make it easier for you to take the medication you may need for other conditions.there are 2 types of feeding tubes: a nasogastric tube – a tube that is passed down your nose and into your stomach a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) tube – a tube that is implanted directly into your stomachnasogastric tubes are designed for short-term use. the tube will need to be replaced and swapped to the other nostril after about a month. peg tubes are designed for long-term use and last several months before they need to be replaced.most people with dysphagia prefer to use a peg tube because it can be hidden under clothing. however, they carry a greater risk of complications compared with nasogastric tubes.minor complications of peg tubes include tube displacement, skin infection, and a blocked or leaking tube. 2 major complications of peg tubes are infection and internal bleeding.resuming normal feeding may be more difficult with a peg tube compared with using a nasogastric tube. the convenience of peg tubes can make people less willing to carry out swallowing exercises and dietary changes than those who use nasogastric tubes.you should discuss the pros and cons of both types of feeding tubes with your treatment team.low dysphagia is swallowing difficulties caused by problems with the oesophagus.depending on the cause of low dysphagia, it may be possible to treat it with medication. for example, proton pump inhibitors (ppis) used to treatindigestionmay improve symptoms caused by narrowing or scarring of the oesophagus.botulinum toxin can sometimes be used to treat achalasia. this is a condition where the muscles in the oesophagus become too stiff to allow food and liquid to enter the stomach.it can be used to paralyse the tightened muscles that prevent food from reaching the stomach. however, the effects only last for around 6 months.other cases of low dysphagia can usually be treated with surgery.endoscopic dilation is widely used to treat dysphagia caused by obstruction. it can also be used to stretch your oesophagus if it’s scarred.endoscopic dilatation will be carried out during an internal examination of your oesophagus (gastroscopy) using an endoscopy.an endoscope is passed down your throat and into your oesophagus, and images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen.using the image as guidance, a small balloon or a bougie (a thin, flexible medical instrument) is passed through the narrowed part of your oesophagus to widen it. if a balloon is used, it will be gradually inflated to widen your oesophagus before being deflated and removed.you may be given a mild sedative before the procedure to relax you. there’s a small risk that the procedure could cause a tear or perforate your oesophagus.if you haveoesophageal cancerthat can’t be removed, it’s usually recommended that you have a stent inserted instead of endoscopic dilatation. this is because, if you have cancer, there’s a higher risk of perforating your oesophagus if it’s stretched.a stent (usually a metal mesh tube) is inserted into your oesophagus during an endoscopy or underx-rayguidance.the stent then gradually expands to create a passage wide enough to allow food to pass through. you’ll need to follow a particular diet to keep the stent open without having blockages.if your baby is born with difficulty swallowing (congenital dysphagia), their treatment will depend on the cause.dysphagia caused by cerebral palsy can be treated with speech and language therapy. your child will be taught how to swallow, how to adjust the type of food they eat, and how to use feeding tubes.cleft lip and palate is a facial birth defect that can cause dysphagia. it’s usually treated with surgery.narrowing of the oesophagus may be treated with a type of surgery called dilatation to widen the oesophagus.dysphagia caused bygastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord)can be treated using special thickened feeds instead of your usual breast or formula milk. sometimes medication may also be used.if you’re having difficulty bottle feeding or breastfeeding your baby, see your midwife, health visitor or gp.the main complication of dysphagia is coughing and choking, which can lead to pneumonia.if you have dysphagia, there’s a risk of food, drink or saliva going down the ‘wrong way’. it can block your airway, making it difficult to breathe and causing you to cough or choke.read more information and advice aboutwhat to do if someone is choking.if you have dysphagia, you may also develop a fear of choking. however, it’s very important you don’t avoid eating and drinking, as it could causedehydrationandmalnutrition.if you often choke on your food because of dysphagia, you may also be at an increased risk of developing a condition called aspirationpneumonia.aspiration pneumonia is a chest infection that can develop after accidentally inhaling something, such as a small piece of food. it causes irritation in the lungs, or damages them. older people are particularly at risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.the symptoms of aspiration pneumonia include: a cough – this may be a dry cough, or you may produce phlegm that’s yellow, green, brown, or bloodstained a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or over chest pain difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow and you may feel breathless, even at restcontact your treatment team immediately if you’re being treated for dysphagia and you develop these symptoms. if this isn’t possible, contact your localout-of-hours serviceor phonenhs 24 111 service.symptoms of aspiration pneumonia can range from mild to severe, and it is usually treated withantibiotics. severe cases will require hospital admission and treatment with intravenous antibiotics (through a drip). read more abouttreating pneumonia.in particularly old or frail people, there’s a chance the infection could lead to their lungs becoming filled with fluid, preventing them working properly. this is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards).your chances of developing pneumonia as a result of dysphagia are higher if you have a weakened immune system,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), or if your oral anddental hygieneis poor.if children with long-term dysphagia aren’t eating enough, they may not get the essential nutrients they need for physical and mental development.children who have difficulty eating may also find meal times stressful, which may lead to behavioural problems. gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) the stroke association: life after

       " 'Dystonia': \"dystonia is a neurological movement disorder. people with dystonia experience involuntary muscle spasms and contractions.movements are often repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures. tremor (shaking) is often associated with some types of dystonia.dystonia can be a condition on its own (primary dystonia). some people experience dystonia as a symptom of another condition (secondary dystonia).symptoms of dystonia can include:the symptoms may be continuous or come and go. they may be triggered by voluntary movements.there are different types of dystonia.generalised dystonia affects all parts of the body.if you have focal dystonia, only one muscle group is affected.the most common type of focal dystonia is neck dystonia, also known as cervical dystonia. this usually causes the head to be pulled in one direction. this can then affect movement and cause pain.other types of focal dystonia can impact: your voice (laryngeal dystonia) the muscles around your eyes (blepharospasm) limbs (like writer’s cramp)dystonia is thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain that controls movement.primary and secondary dystonia may have different underlying causes.primary dystonia often begins in childhood. this type of dystonia is more likely to have a recognised genetic cause.you might experience dystonia as a symptom of another condition.secondary dystonia might be caused by: parkinson’s disease cerebral palsy certain medications (like some antipsychotics and some anti sickness medications) injury to the brain strokeif your gp thinks you have dystonia, they may refer you to a specialist neurologist.you may need to have tests to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia.depending on your symptoms, you might have a blood test or scan.there are treatments that can control the involuntary movements and spasms of dystonia.you might need to try several treatment options to find out which one works best.if you have focal dystonia, you might be offered botulinum toxin.botulinum toxin is injected into the affected muscles. it blocks the neurotransmitters within the nerve, reducing muscle spasms.the effects of the injection can last from around 3 months to 6 months.oral medications, like tablets, can be effective for some people with generalised dystonia.the following are medications which might be used to treat dystonia: anticholinergics baclofen muscle relaxantsdepending on the type of dystonia you have, physiotherapy might help you improve your range of movement.you might have surgery if your dystonia symptoms don’t improve with other treatments.deep brain stimulation (dbs) is a type of brain surgery. it’s offered to some people with dystonia where other treatments haven’t been successful.the surgeon will place a small device, like a pacemaker, under the skin of your chest or tummy.the device sends electrical signals along wires placed in the part of the brain that controls movement.it’ll be several weeks or months before you begin to feel the benefit of dbs.read more about deep brain stimulation parkinson's disease dystonia uk\",\n",
       " 'Febrile seizures': 'a febrile seizure is a fit that can happen when a child has a fever.febrile seizures are also sometimes called febrile convulsions. they are relatively common and, in most cases, aren’t serious.around one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. they most often occur between the ages of six months and three years.during a febrile seizure, the child’s body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. some children may wet themselves. this is known as a tonic clonic seizure.read more about thesymptoms of febrile seizuresif your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in therecovery position. lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. this will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury.stay with your child and try to make a note of how long the seizure lasts.if it’s your child’s first seizure, or it lasts longer than five minutes, take them to thenearest hospitalas soon as possible, or dial 999 for an ambulance. while it’s unlikely that there’s anything seriously wrong, it’s best to be sure.if your child has had febrile seizures before and the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your gp or the nhs 24 111 service for advice.don’t put anything, including medication, in your child’s mouth during a seizure because there’s a slight chance that they might bite their tongue.almost all children make a complete recovery after having a febrile seizure.read more aboutdiagnosing febrile seizuresandtreating febrile seizuresthere are two main types of febrile seizure.a simple febrile seizure is the most common type of febrile seizure, accounting for about eight out of 10 cases. it’s a fit that: is a tonic clonic seizure (see above) lasts less than 15 minutes doesn’t reoccur within 24 hours or the period in which your child has an illnesscomplex febrile seizures are less common, accounting for two out of 10 cases. a complex febrile seizure is any seizure that has one or more of the following features: the seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes your child only has symptoms in one part of their body (this is known as a partial or focal seizure) your child has another seizure within 24 hours of the first seizure, or during the same period of illness your child doesn’t fully recover from the seizure within one hourthe cause of febrile seizures is unknown, although they’re linked to the start of a fever (a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or above).in most cases, a high temperature is caused by an infection such as: chickenpox flu (influenza) middle ear infections (otitis media) tonsillitisthere may also be a genetic link to febrile seizures because the chances of having a seizure are increased if a close family member has a history of them. around one in four children affected by febrile seizures has a family history of the condition.read more about thecauses of febrile seizuresfebrile seizures have been linked to an increased risk ofepilepsy, as well as other problems.recent research findings may indicate a link between febrile seizures and sudden unexplained death in childhood (sudc), possibly due to the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy.however, this link hasn’t been proven and sudc is incredibly rare, affecting around one in 100,000 children which is equivalent to a 0.001% chance.in addition, one of the biggest studies of its kind looked at more than 1.5 million children with a history of febrile seizures and found no evidence of an increased risk of death in later childhood or adulthood.many parents worry that if their child has one or more febrile seizures, they’ll developepilepsywhen they get older. epilepsy is a condition where a person has repeated seizures without fever.while it’s true that children who have a history of febrile seizures have an increased risk of developing epilepsy, it should be stressed that the risk is still small.it’s estimated that children with a history of simple febrile seizures have a one in 50 chance of developing epilepsy in later life. children with a history of complex febrile seizures have a one in 20 chance of developing epilepsy in later life.this is compared to around a one in 100 chance for people who haven’t had febrile seizures.the main symptom of a febrile seizure is a fit that occurs while a child has a fever.febrile seizures often occur during the first day of a fever, which is defined as a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or above.however, there appears to be no connection between the extent of your child’s fever and the start of a seizure. seizures can occur even if your child has a mild fever.simple febrile seizurescan happen when there’s a rapid rise in temperature and you may only realise your child is ill when they have a fit. alternatively, they can occur as your child’s temperature drops from a high level.during simple febrile seizures: your child’s body will become stiff and their arms and legs will begin to twitch they’ll lose consciousness and they may wet or soil themselves they may also vomit and foam at the mouth and their eyes may roll back the seizure usually lasts for less than five minutes following the seizure, your child may be sleepy for up to an hour afterwardscomplex febrile seizurestend to last longer than 15 minutes, and the symptoms may only affect one area of your child’s body. the seizure sometimes recurs within 24 hours or during the period in which your child is ill.you should take your child to hospital or dial 999 for an ambulance if: your child is having a fit for the first time the seizure lasts longer than five minutes and shows no signs of stopping you suspect the seizure is being caused by another serious illness, for examplemeningitis your child is having breathing difficultiesif your child has previously had febrile seizures, it’s recommended that you telephone your gp or call the nhs 24 111 service for advice.you should also contact your gp or the nhs 24 111 service if your child showssigns and symptoms of dehydration(a lack of fluid in the body). this includes: adry mouth sunken eyes a lack of tears when crying a sunken fontanelle – the soft spot usually found at the top of a young child’s headfebrile seizures are linked to fevers, but the exact cause is unknown.some researchers think that the biological processes associated with a high temperature may be responsible.a high temperature is thought to be caused by a bacterial or viral infection that stimulates the release of cytokines. cytokines are proteins that affect the parts of the brain and nervous system responsible for regulating the body’s temperature. their release causes a rise in the body’s temperature.one theory is that in certain people, high levels of cytokines may temporarily ‘scramble’ the workings of the brain and nervous system, triggering a seizure.although febrile seizures are poorly understood, a family history of the conditions is thought to increase the risk.if a child has a first-degree relative (mother, father, sister or brother) with a history of febrile seizures, their risk of having seizures increases. the more relatives affected, the higher the risk.this is probably the result of one or more genetic mutations that a child inherits from their parents, which makes them more susceptible to seizures. a genetic mutation means the instructions carried in certain genes become ‘scrambled’, resulting in some of the body’s processes not working in the normal way.most febrile seizures occur when a child has a high temperature caused by an infection. the three most common infections associated with febrile convulsions are: viral infections, such aschickenpoxandflu middle ear infections(otitis media) tonsillitisother infections associated with febrile seizures are: urinary tract infections (utis) upper respiratory tract infection – an infection of the mouth, nose and throat, and associated tissues and structures gastroenteritis– an infection of the digestive system lower respiratory tract infections, such aspneumonia(a lung infection) andbronchitis(an infection of the airways that supply the lungs)in rare cases, febrile seizures can occur after a child has a vaccination. research has shown that your child has a one in 3,000 to 4,000 chance of having a febrile seizure after having themmr vaccine.the risks are even lower with thedtap/ipv/hib vaccine– a one in 11,000 to 16,000.febrile seizures can often be diagnosed from a description of what happened.further tests may be needed if the cause of the associated infection isn’t clear.it’s unlikely that your doctor will see the seizure, so an account of what happened is useful.it’s useful to know: how long the seizure lasted what happened – body stiffening, twitching of the face, arms and legs, staring and loss of consciousness whether your child recovered within one hour whether they’ve had a seizure beforetests to identify the source of the infection will only usually be necessary to rule out rarer conditions which can cause similar symptoms, such asmeningitis.a blood or urine sample may be needed to test for signs of infection. it can sometimes be difficult to obtain a urine sample from young children, so it may have to be done in hospital.read more aboutblood testsfurther tests may be carried out in hospital if your child’s symptoms are unusual – for example, if they don’t have a high temperature or their seizures don’t follow the normal pattern.further testing and observation in hospital is also usually recommended if your child is havingcomplex febrile seizures.your child may have other tests including an electroencephalogram and lumbar puncture, particularly if they’re less than 12 months old.these two tests are explained below.an electroencephalogram (eeg) measures your child’s electrical brain activity through electrodes that are placed on their scalp. unusual patterns of brain activity can sometimes indicateepilepsy.however, some studies have suggested that an eeg may not be useful in many cases of febrile seizures.during alumbar puncture, a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) is removed for testing. csf is a clear fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.a hollow needle is inserted into the base of the spine to obtain the csf sample. during the procedure,local anaestheticwill be used to numb your child’s back so that they don’t feel any pain.a lumbar puncture can be used to determine whether your child has an infection of the brain or nervous system.in many cases, febrile seizures do not need to be treated, although care should be taken to deal with a seizure as it happens.if your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in therecovery position. lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. this will stop them swallowing any vomit, and will keep their airway open and help prevent injury.stay with your child while they’re having a seizure, and make a note of when the seizure started to keep track of how long it lasts. if the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your gp or call the nhs 24 111 service.if it’s your child’s first seizure, or if it lasts longer than five minutes, take your child to thenearest hospitalas soon as possible.while there’s probably nothing seriously wrong with your child, it’s best to be sure.don’t put anything, including medication, in your child’s mouth while they’re having a seizure. there’s a slight chance that they might bite their tongue, although any damage isn’t usually serious and will heal within a few days.trying to stop someone biting their tongue by placing your hand or an object in their mouth could be dangerous both for you and for them.reducing a high temperature can help make your child feel more comfortable.paracetamolandibuprofenhave been shown to be effective in reducing a high temperature. however, they won’t reduce the chances of your child actually having a seizure.removing any unnecessary clothes and bedding will also help to lower your child’s temperature.aspirin should never be given to children under 16 years of age because there’s a small risk that the medication could trigger a condition called reye’s syndrome, which can cause brain and liver damage.the use of cold sponges or fans isn’t recommended for treating a high temperature. there’s little evidence that they’re effective, and they may cause your child discomfort. your gp will be able to give you additional advice about treating the underlying cause of your child’s high temperature.it’s also important to preventdehydrationduring a fever by making sure your child drinks plenty of fluids.about one third of children will have a febrile seizure again during a subsequent infection. this often occurs within a year of the first febrile seizure.recurrence is more likely if: the first febrile seizure occurred before your child was 18 months old there’s a history of seizures orepilepsyin your family before having the first seizure your child had a fever that lasted less than one hour or their temperature was less than 40c (104f) your child has multiple seizures during the same febrile episode (complex febrile seizure) your child attends a day care nursery (this increases their chances of developing common childhood infections, such as thefluorchickenpox)it’s not recommended that your child is given a prescription of regular medicines to prevent further febrile seizures. this is because the adverse side effects associated with many medicines outweigh any risks of the seizures themselves.research has shown that the use of medication to control fever isn’t likely to prevent recurrence of further febrile seizures.however, there may be exceptional circumstances where medication to prevent recurrent febrile seizures is recommended. for example, children may need medication if they have a low threshold for having seizures during illness, particularly if the seizures are prolonged.in this case, your child may be prescribed medications such as diazepam or lorazepam to take at the start of a fever.children who’ve had a febrile seizure following a routinevaccination(which is very rare), are no more at risk of having another seizure compared to children who’ve had a seizure due to another cause for fever.',\n",

       " 'Functional neurological disorder (FND)': 'functional neurological disorder (fnd) describes a problem with how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.it’s often helpful to think of your brain as a computer. in someone who has fnd, there’s no damage to the hardware, or structure, of the brain. it’s the software, or program running on the computer, that isn’t working properly.the problems that cause fnd are going on in a level of the brain that you cannot control. it includes symptoms like arm and leg weakness and seizures. other symptoms like fatigue or pain are not directly caused by fnd, but are often found alongside it.fnd can have many symptoms that can vary from person to person. some people may have few symptoms, and some people may have many.a diagnosis of fnd should be made because you have one or more clinical features that a specialist can recognise as typical of fnd. it shouldn’t be made just because scans or tests for other neurological conditions that have similar symptoms are normal.a clinical feature is a distinctive way that your symptom presents that is unique to fnd. for example, it could be that your eyes close during seizures, or that limb weakness briefly disappears during certain physical tests. clinical features are what specialists use to identify fnd from other neurological conditions with similar symptoms.functional limb weakness is when a leg or an arm doesn’t work properly. in fnd, this happens because of a problem with how the nervous system is functioning.it can cause a range of symptoms, including:functional limb weakness can often look a symptoms of astrokeormultiple sclerosis.if you have fnd, any scans you have will show no damage to the brain to explain the weakness.a specialist

urinary retentiondespite all tests being normal (which may be diagnosed asfowlers syndrome) dysfunctional breathingwe know that the symptoms of fnd happen because there’s a problem with how the brain is sending and receiving messages to itself and other parts of the body. using research tools, scientists can see that certain circuits in the brain are not working properly in people with fnd.however, there’s still a lot of research to be done to understand how and why fnd happens.fnd can happen for a wide range of reasons. there’s often more than one reason, and the reasons can vary hugely from person to person.some of the reasons why the brain stops working properly in fnd include: the brain trying to get rid of a painful sensation a migraine or other neurological symptom the brain shutting down a part or all of the body in response to a situation it thinks is threateningin some people, stressful events in the past or present can be relevant to fnd. in others, stress is not relevant.the risk of developing fnd increases if you have another neurological condition.read more about how and why fnd happens.when diagnosing fnd, your healthcare provider will carry out an assessment to see if there are typical clinical features of fnd.your healthcare provider may still choose to test for other diseases and conditions before diagnosing fnd. this is because many conditions share the same symptoms and, in around a quarter of cases, fnd is present alongside another neurological condition. someone can have both fnd and conditions like sciatica, carpal tunnel syndrome, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis (ms).the diagnosis of fnd, however, should be given because you have the clinical features of fnd. it shouldn’t be given just because there’s no evidence of other conditions or illnesses.because the symptoms of fnd are not always there, your healthcare provider may ask you to video your symptoms. this will allow them to see what your symptoms look like.fnd is a really variable condition. some people have quite short-lived symptoms. others can have them for many years.there are treatments available that can manage and improve fnd. these treatments are all forms of rehabilitation therapy, which aims to improve your ability to carry out every day activities. many of these treatments are designed to ‘retrain the brain’. some people with fnd benefit a lot from treatment and may go into remission. other people continue to have fnd symptoms despite treatment.specialised physiotherapy can be useful in treating fnd. it helps to remind the

       " 'Fungal nail infection': 'many people develop a fungal nail infection at some point in their life. it’s not usually serious, but can be unpleasant and difficult to treat.the infection develops slowly and causes the nail to become discoloured, thickened and distorted.toenails are more frequently affected than the fingernails.the medical name for a fungal nail infection is onychomycosis.a fungal nail infection may not cause any obvious symptoms at first.as it progresses, the infection can cause:sometimes the skin nearby may also become: infected itchy cracked red swollenmost fungal nail infections occur as a result of the fungi that cause athlete’s foot infecting the nails.these fungi often live harmlessly on your skin, but they can sometimes multiply and lead to infections. the fungi prefer warm, dark and moist places like the feet.you’re more likely to get a fungal nail infection if you: don’t keep your feet clean and dry wear shoes that cause your feet to get hot and sweaty walk around barefoot in places where fungal infections can spread easily, like communal showers, locker rooms and gyms have damaged your nails have a weakened immune system have certain other health conditions, likediabetes,psoriasisor peripheral arterial diseasefungal nail infections can be spread to other people, so you should take steps to avoid this if you have an infection. you’re bothered by the appearance of a nail with a fungal nail infection the fungal nail infection is causing problems like pain or discomforta fungal nail infection is unlikely to get better without treatment. however, if you’re not bothered by it you might decide it’s not worth treating because treatment: can take a long time can cause side effects isn’t always effectivetreatment may also be unnecessary in mild cases of fungal nail infection. it’s also unlikely to cause any further problems so you may feel it’s not worth treating.for more severe or troublesome fungal nail infections, antifungal medication may be recommended.antifungal medication comes in tablets or a special paint you apply directly to the nail.a small sample of the infected nail may need to be taken and sent off for testing before treatment starts, to confirm that you do have a fungal infection.if the treatment is working, you should see a new healthy nail start to grow from the base of nail over the course of a few months. the old infected nail should begin to grow out and can be gradually clipped away.antifungal treatments are thought to be effective in treating about 60 to 80% of fungal nail infections. it can take between 6 and 18 months for the appearance of the affected nail to return to normal, and in some cases the nail may not look the same as before the infection.terbinafine and itraconazole are the 2 medicines most commonly prescribed for fungal nail infections.these usually need to be taken once or twice a day for several months to ensure the infection has completely cleared up. if you stop taking the medication too early, the infection may return.possible side effects of antifungal tablets can include: headache itching diarrhoea loss of sense of taste a rashantifungal tablets are currently not licensed to be sold over the counter. this is because these tablets have many listed side effects, contraindications and need to be taken for several months.if you prefer not to take antifungal tablets, your gp or pharmacist may suggest you try antifungal nail paint instead.nail paint isn’t generally considered to be as effective as tablets because it can be difficult for it to reach the deeper layers of the nail. however, it doesn’t usually cause any side effects.like antifungal tablets, antifungal nail paint also normally needs to be used for several months to ensure that the infection has cleared up.speak to your gp if new, healthy nail doesn’t start to grow after a few weeks of treatment.keep using the treatment until your gp says you can stop. stopping too early could result in the infection returning.as it can take a long time for antifungal medication to work, some people may prefer to use a treatment that involves softening and removing infected parts of nail over a few weeks.treatment kits are available from pharmacies that contain a 40% urea paste, plasters and a scraping device. the paste softens the infected parts of the nail, allowing them to be scraped away so they can be gradually replaced with healthy nail.to use the treatment: wash the affected area and dry it thoroughly carefully apply the paste to the infected nails cover the nails with plasters and leave them for 24 hours wash the paste off the next day and scrape away the softened parts of the nail repeat this process each day for 2 to 3 weeksonce no more infected parts of the nail can be removed, ask your pharmacist for antifungal nail paint to prevent re-infection as the nail regrows over the next few months.a procedure to remove affected nails completely isn’t usually necessary, but may be recommended if the infection is severe or painful and other treatments haven’t helped.if your nail is surgically removed, a new nail should eventually grow back in its place. however, it could take a year or more for the nail to grow back completely.laser treatment is a possible option if you have a fungal nail infection that’s particularly stubborn. the laser emits high doses of light energy, which are used to destroy the fungus.early research suggests the treatment may be helpful in treating fungal nail infections, but there’s currently not enough evidence to recommend it as a routine treatment.if you want to try laser treatment, you’ll have to pay for it privately because it’s not available on the nhs. be aware that the treatment may need to be repeated several times for up to a year, so it could get very expensive.whether or not you decide to have treatment, you should still follow self-help advice to help stop the condition getting worse or spreading to others. keep your hands and feet clean and dry wear well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks – these will allow your feet to “breathe” clip your nails to keep them short – don’t share clippers or scissors with other people replace old footwear that could be contaminated with fungi treat athlete’s foot as soon as possible to avoid the infection spreading to your nails ensure your towels are washed regularly make sure any equipment is properly sterilised between uses if you visit a nail salon do not share towels and socks with other people do not walk around barefoot in public pools, showers, and locker rooms – special shower shoes are available to protect your feet bad: fungal infections of the nails',\n",

gallstone becomes trapped in a duct (opening) inside the gallbladder it can trigger a sudden intense abdominal pain that usually lasts between 1 and 5 hours. this type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic.some people with gallstones can also develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), which can cause: persistent pain jaundice a feverwhen gallstones

especially in people who are already in poor health. however, deaths from gallstone disease are rare in the uk.most cases of gallstones don’t cause any symptoms. but if a gallstone blocks one of the bile ducts, it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain, known as biliary colic.other symptoms may develop if the blockage is more severe or develops in another part of the digestive system.gallstones can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain that usually lasts 1 to 5 hours (although it can sometimes last just a few minutes).the pain can be felt: in the centre of your abdomen (tummy) just under the

exactly what leads to this imbalance, but gallstones can form if: there are unusually high levels of cholesterol inside the gallbladder (about 4 in every 5 gallstones are made up of cholesterol) there are unusually high levels of a waste product called bilirubin inside the gallbladder (about 1 in every 5 gallstones is made up of bilirubin)these chemical imbalances cause tiny crystals to develop in the bile. these can gradually grow (often over many years) into solid stones that can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pebble.sometimes only 1 stone will form, but there are often several at the same time.gallstones are more common if you: are female, particularly if you’ve had children, are taking the combined pill, or are undergoing high-dose oestrogen therapy are overweight orobese are aged 40 years or older (the older you are, the more likely you are to develop gallstones) have a condition that affects the flow of bile – such ascirrhosis(scarring of the liver), primary sclerosing cholangitis, orobstetric cholestasis havecrohn’s diseaseorirritable bowel syndrome (ibs) have a close family member who’s also had gallstones have recently lost weight (from either dieting or weight-loss surgery) are taking an antibiotic called ceftriaxonegallstones may be discovered during tests for a different condition, as they often don’t cause any symptoms.if you do havesymptoms of gallstones, make an appointment with your gp so they can try to identify the problem.your gp will ask about your symptoms in detail and may carry out the murphy’s sign test to help determine if your gallbladder is inflamed.during this test, your gp places their hand or fingers on the upper-right area of your tummy and asks you to breathe in. if you find this painful, it usually means your gallbladder is inflamed and you may need urgent treatment.your gp may also recommend havingblood teststo look for signs of infection, or to check if your liver is working normally. if gallstones have moved into your bile duct, the liver may not be able to function properly.if your symptoms and test results suggest you may have gallstones, you’ll usually be referred for further tests. you may be admitted to hospital for tests the same day if your symptoms suggest you have a more severe form of gallbladder disease.gallstones can usually be confirmed using an ultrasound scan, which uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of the body.the type of ultrasound scan used for gallstones is similar to the scan used during pregnancy, where a small handheld device called a transducer is placed onto your skin and moved over your upper abdomen.sound waves are sent from the transducer, through your skin and into your body. they bounce back off the body tissues, forming an image on a monitor. this is a painless procedure that usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.when gallstones are diagnosed, there may be some uncertainty about whether any stones have passed into the bile duct.gallstones in the bile duct are sometimes seen during an ultrasound scan. if they’re not visible but your tests suggest the bile duct may be affected, you may need an mri scan or a cholangiography.amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanmay be carried out to look for gallstones in the bile ducts. this type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body.a procedure called a cholangiography can give further information about the condition of your gallbladder.a cholangiography uses a dye that shows up onx-rays. the dye may be injected into your bloodstream or injected directly into your bile ducts during surgery or using an endoscope passed through your mouth.after the dye has been introduced, x-ray images are taken. they’ll reveal any abnormality in your bile or pancreatic systems. if your gallbladder and bile systems are working normally, the dye will be absorbed in the places it’s meant to go (your liver, bile ducts, intestines and gallbladder).if a blockage is detected during this test, your doctor may try to remove it at this point using an endoscope. this is known as an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ercp). seetreating gallstonesfor more information about ercp.acomputerised tomography (ct) scanmay be carried out to look for any complications of gallstones, such asacute pancreatitis. this type of scan involves taking a series of x-rays from many different angles.ct scans are often done in an emergency to diagnose severe abdominal pain.your treatment plan for gallstones depends on how the symptoms are affecting your daily life.if you don’t have any symptoms, a policy of ‘active monitoring’ is often recommended. this means you won’t receive immediate treatment, but you should let your gp know if you notice any symptoms.as a general rule, the longer you go without symptoms, the less likely it is that your condition will get worse.you may need treatment if you have a condition that increases your risk of developing complications, such as: scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) high blood pressure inside the liver – this is known as portal hypertension and is often a complication ofalcohol-related liver disease diabetestreatment may also be recommended if a scan shows high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, as this can lead togallbladder cancerin later life.if you have episodes of abdominal pain (biliary colic), treatment depends on how the pain affects your daily activities. if the episodes are mild and infrequent, you may be prescribed painkillers to control further episodes and given advice about eating a healthy diet to help control the pain.if your symptoms are more severe and occur frequently, surgery to remove the gallbladder is usually recommended.the gallbladder isn’t an essential organ and you can lead a perfectly normal life without one. some people may experience symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating fatty or spicy food. if certain foods do trigger symptoms, you may wish to avoid them in the future.if surgery is recommended, you’ll usually have keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder. this is known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3 or 4 small cuts are made in your abdomen. one larger cut (about 2cm to 3cm) will be by the belly button and the others (each 1cm or less) will be on the right side of your abdomen.your abdomen is temporarily inflated using carbon dioxide gas. this is harmless and makes it easier for the surgeon to see your organs.a laparoscope (long thin telescope with a tiny light and video camera at the end) is inserted through one of the cuts in your abdomen. this allows your surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor. your surgeon will then remove your gallbladder using special surgical instruments.if it’s thought there may be gallstones in the bile duct, an x-ray or ultrasound scan of the bile duct is also taken during the operation. if gallstones are found, they may be removed during keyhole surgery. if the operation can’t be done this way or an unexpected complication occurs, it may have to be converted to open surgery.after the gallbladder has been removed, the gas in your abdomen escapes through the laparoscope and the cuts are closed with dissolvable stitches and covered with dressings.laparoscopic cholecystectomies are usually performed under ageneral anaesthetic, which means you’ll be asleep during the procedure and won’t feel any pain while it’s carried out. the operation takes 60 to 90 minutes and you can usually go home the same day. full recovery typically takes around 10 days.single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a newer type of keyhole surgery used to remove the gallbladder. during this type of surgery, only one small cut is made, which means you’ll only have one barely visible scar.however, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies haven’t been carried out as often as conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomies, so there are still some uncertainties about it. access to this type of surgery is also limited because it needs an experienced surgeon with specialist training.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has more information onsingle-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.a laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not always be recommended, for example if you: are in the third trimester (the last three months) of pregnancy are extremely overweight have an unusual gallbladder or bile duct structure that makes a keyhole procedure difficult and potentially dangerousin these circumstances, an open cholecystectomy may be recommended. during this procedure, a 10cm to 15cm (4in to 6in) incision is made in your abdomen underneath the ribs so the gallbladder can be removed. this is done under general anaesthetic, so you’ll be asleep and won’t feel any pain.open surgery is just as effective as laparoscopic surgery, but it does have a longer recovery time and causes more visible scarring. most people have to stay in hospital for up to 5 days and it typically takes 6 weeks to fully recover.an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ercp) is a procedure that can be used to remove gallstones from the bile duct. the gallbladder isn’t removed during this procedure, so any stones in the gallbladder will remain unless removed using the surgical techniques mentioned above.ercp is similar to a diagnostic cholangiography (seediagnosing gallstonesfor more information), where an endoscope (long, thin flexible tube with a camera at the end) is passed through your mouth down to where the bile duct opens into the small intestine.however, during ercp the opening of the bile duct is widened with a small incision or an electrically heated wire. the bile duct stones are then removed or left to pass into your intestine and out of your body.sometimes a small tube called a stent is permanently placed in the bile duct to help the bile and stones pass.an ercp is usually carried out under sedation, which means you’ll be awake throughout the procedure but won’t experience any pain.the ercp procedure lasts about 30 minutes on average, but can take from 15 minutes to over an hour. you may need to stay overnight in hospital after the procedure so you can be monitored.if your gallstones are small and don’t contain calcium, it may be possible to take ursodeoxycholic acid tablets to dissolve them.however, these aren’t prescribed very often because: they’re rarely very effective they need to be taken for a long time (up to 2 years) gallstones can recur once treatment is stoppedside effects of ursodeoxycholic acid are uncommon and are usually mild. the most commonly reported side effects are feeling sick, being sick and itchy skin.the use of ursodeoxycholic acid isn’t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. sexually active women should use either a barrier method ofcontraception, such as acondom, or a low-dose oestrogen contraceptive pill while taking ursodeoxycholic acid, as it may affect other types of oral contraceptive pills.ursodeoxycholic acid tablets are occasionally also prescribed as a precaution against gallstones if it’s thought you’re at risk of developing them. for example, you may be prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid if you’ve recently had weight loss surgery, as rapid weight loss can cause gallstones to grow.a small number of people with gallstones may develop serious problems if the gallstones cause a severe blockage or move into another part of the digestive system.in some cases of gallstone disease a bile duct can become permanently blocked, which can lead to a build-up of bile inside the gallbladder. this can cause the gallbladder to become infected and inflamed.the medical term for inflammation of the gallbladder is acute cholecystitis. symptoms include: pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade (unlike biliary colic, the pain usually lasts longer than five hours) a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above a rapid heartbeatan estimated 1 in 7 people with acute cholecystitis also experience jaundice (see below).acute cholecystitis is usually treated first withantibioticsto settle the infection and thenkeyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder. this operation can be more difficult when performed as an emergency and there’s a higher risk of it being converted to an open procedure.sometimes a severe infection can lead to a gallbladder abscess (empyema of the gallbladder). antibiotics alone don’t always treat these and they may need to be drained.occasionally a severely inflamed gallbladder can tear, leading to peritonitis (inflammation of the inside lining of the abdomen). if this happens, you may need to have antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenous antibiotics) and surgery may be required to remove a section of the lining if part of it becomes severely damaged.read more aboutacute cholecystitis.if a gallstone passes out of the gallbladder into the bile duct and blocks the flow of bile, jaundice occurs.symptoms of jaundice include: yellowing of the skin and eyes dark brown urine pale stools itchingsometimes the stone passes from the bile duct on its own. if it doesn’t, the stone needs to be removed. seetreating gallstones.if the bile ducts become blocked, they’re vulnerable to infection by bacteria. the medical term for a bile duct infection is acute cholangitis.symptoms of acute cholangitis include: pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade a high temperature jaundice chills confusion itchy skin generally feeling unwellantibiotics will help treat the infection, but it’s also important to help the bile from the liver to drain with an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ercp). readtreating gallstonesfor more information.acute pancreatitismay develop when a gallstone moves out of the gallbladder and blocks the opening (duct) of the pancreas, causing it to become inflamed.the most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is a sudden severe dull pain in the centre of your upper abdomen, around the top of your stomach.the pain of acute pancreatitis often gets steadily worse until it reaches a constant ache. the ache may travel from your abdomen and along your back and may feel worse after you have eaten. leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain.other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include: feeling sick being sick diarrhoea loss of appetite a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above tenderness of the abdomen less commonly, jaundicethere’s currently no cure for acute pancreatitis, so treatment focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed.this usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given: fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids) pain relief nutritional support oxygen through tubes into your nosewith treatment, most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days.read more aboutacute pancreatitis.gallbladder canceris a rare but serious complication of gallstones. an estimated 660 cases of gallbladder cancer are diagnosed in the uk each year.having a history of gallstones increases your risk of developing gallbladder cancer. approximately 4 out of every 5 people who have cancer of the gallbladder also have a history of gallstones.however, people with a history of gallstones have a less than one in 10,000 chance of developing gallbladder cancer.if you have additional risk factors, such as a family history of gallbladder cancer or high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, it may be recommended that your gallbladder be removed as a precaution, even if your gallstones aren’t causing any symptoms.the symptoms of gallbladder cancer are similar to those of complicated gallstone disease, including: abdominal pain high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above jaundicegallbladder cancer can be treated with a combination of surgery,chemotherapyandradiotherapy.another rare but serious complication of gallstones is known as gallstone ileus. this is where the bowel becomes obstructed by a gallstone.gallstone ileus can occur when an abnormal channel, known as a fistula, opens up near the gallbladder. gallstones are then able to travel through the fistula and can block the bowel.symptoms of gallstone ileus include: abdominal pain being sick swelling of the abdomen constipationa bowel obstruction requires immediate medical treatment. if it’s not treated, there’s a risk that the bowel could split open (rupture). this could cause internal bleeding and widespread infection.if you suspect you have an obstructed bowel, contact your gp as soon as possible. if this isn’t possible, phone thenhs 24 111 service.surgery is usually required to remove the gallstone and unblock the bowel. the type of surgery you receive depends on where in the bowel the obstruction has occurred.from the limited evidence available, changes to your diet and losing weight (if you’re overweight) may help prevent gallstones.because of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it is advisable to avoid eating too many foods with a high saturated fat content.foods high in saturated fat include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter, ghee and lard cream hard cheeses cakes and biscuits food containing coconut or palm oila healthy, balanced diet is recommended. this includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) and wholegrains.there’s also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones.drinking small amounts of alcohol may also help reduce your risk of gallstones. however, you shouldn’t regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week as this can lead to liver problems and other health conditions. regularly drinking any amount of alcohol can increase the risk to your health.read more about: high cholesterol how to lower your cholesterol healthy eatingbeing overweight, particularly being obese, increases the amount of cholesterol in your bile, which increases your risk of developing gallstones. you should control your weight by eating a healthy diet and taking plenty of regular exercise.however, avoid low-calorie, rapid-weight-loss diets. there’s evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and increase your risk of developing gallstones. a more gradual weight loss plan is recommended.read more aboutlosing weightandgetting started with

thecomplications of gord.the main symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) are heartburn and acid reflux.heartburn is an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest.it’s usually felt just below your breastbone, but can spread up to the throat in some people.the discomfort is usually worse after eating, or when bending over or lying down.acid reflux is where acid and other stomach contents are brought back up (regurgitated) into your throat and mouth.it usually causes an unpleasant, sour taste at the back of your mouth.if you have gord, you may also experience: a sore, inflamed

throatand hoarseness a persistentcoughor wheezing, which may be worse at night tooth decayandgum diseaseif you also haveasthma, the symptoms may get worse as a result of stomach acid irritating your airways.gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) is usually caused by the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus (gullet) becoming weakened.normally, this ring of muscle opens to let food into your stomach and closes to stop stomach acid leaking back up into your oesophagus.but for people with gord, stomach acid is able to pass back up into the oesophagus. this causessymptoms of gord, which can include heartburn and acid reflux.it’s not always clear what causes this ring of muscle to become weakened, but certain things can increase the risk of it happening.the following factors may increase your risk of developing gord: being overweight orobese– this can place increased pressure on your stomach and weaken the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus eating large amounts of fatty foods – the stomach takes longer to get rid of stomach acid after digesting a fatty meal and the resulting excess acid may leak up into the oesophagus smoking, alcohol, coffee or chocolate – these may relax the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus pregnancy – temporary changes in hormone levels and increased pressure on your stomach during pregnancy can cause gord hiatus hernia– when part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm (thin sheet of muscle between the chest and tummy) gastroparesis – when the stomach takes longer to get rid of stomach acid, which means excess acid can leak up into the oesophagus certain medicines – some medicines can cause gord or make the symptoms worse, including calcium-channel blockers (used to treathigh blood pressure), nitrates (used to treatangina) andnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) stressgord can sometimes affect several members of the same family and it’s been suggested that the genes you inherit from your parents

using an endoscope, which is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at one end.the endoscope will be gently inserted into your mouth and down your throat. the procedure is usually carried out while you’re awake, but you may be given a sedative to help you relax.the camera can show if the surface of your oesophagus (gullet) has been damaged by stomach acid, although this doesn’t happen to everyone with gord.a barium swallow, or barium meal, is a test to assess your swallowing ability and look for any blockages or abnormalities in your oesophagus.you are first given some barium solution, then somex-raysare taken. barium is a harmless substance that shows up clearly on x-rays as it passes through your digestive system.you’ll be asked not to eat anything for a few hours before the procedure. afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink normally, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your body.manometry is used to assess how well the ring of muscle at the end of your oesophagus is working, by measuring the pressure in your oesophagus.this can rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and can help determine whether surgery would be suitable.during the procedure, a small tube will be passed up your nose and then down into your oesophagus. the tube contains pressure sensors that can detect the pressure in the oesophagus.it may be necessary to measure the acidity level (ph) in your oesophagus to confirm a diagnosis of gord if nothing is found during an endoscopy.the acidity level is measured over 24 hours, using a thin tube containing a sensor that’s passed up your nose and down your oesophagus. this is usually connected to a recording device worn on your waist.you’ll be asked to press a button on the recorder every time you become aware of your symptoms and to record your symptoms in a diary. you should eat as you normally would during the test to ensure an accurate result.sometimes ablood testmay be carried out to check foranaemia, which can be a sign of internal bleeding.heartburn and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) can often be treated with self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines.if these don’t help, your gp can prescribe stronger medication or refer you to a specialist to discuss whether surgery may be an option.you may find the following measures can help reduce heartburn and other symptoms of gord: eat smaller and more frequent meals, rather than 3 large meals a day – don’t eat or drink alcohol within 3 or 4 hours before going to bed, and avoid having your largest meal of the day in the evening avoid anything you think triggers your symptoms – common triggers include coffee, chocolate, tomatoes, alcohol, and fatty or spicy food don’t wear tight clothing – clothes that are tight around your tummy may make your symptoms worse raise the head of your bed by up to 20cm (8 inches) – placing a piece of wood or blocks underneath one end of your bed may reduce symptoms at night; don’t just use extra pillows, as this can put a strain on your tummy try to relax – stress can make heartburn and gord worse, so learningrelaxation techniquesmay help if you’re often feeling stressed maintain a healthy weight – if you’re overweight,losing weightmay help reduce your symptoms stop smoking– smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worseif you’re taking medication for other health conditions, check with your gp to find out whether they could be contributing to your symptoms.different medicines may be available, but don’t stop taking any prescribed medication without consulting your gp first.a number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of gord.over-the-counter heartburn and gord medicines are available from pharmacies without a prescription. the main types are: antacids – these neutralise the effects of stomach acid alginates – these produce a coating that protects the stomach and oesophagus (gullet) from stomach acid low-dose proton-pump inhibitors and h2-receptor antagonists – see below for more information about thesethese medicines aren’t suitable for everyone, so you should check the leaflet first. ask a pharmacist for advice if you’re not sure.if your symptoms don’t get better despite trying self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines, your gp may prescribe a ppi. these work by reducing the amount of acid produced by your stomach.you’ll usually be given enough medication to last a month. go back to your gp if they don’t help or your symptoms return after treatment finishes. some people need to take ppis on a long-term basis.the possible side effects of ppis are usually mild. they include headaches,diarrhoeaorconstipation, feeling sick,abdominal pain, dizziness and a rash.your gp will prescribe the lowest dose that they think will control your symptoms to reduce the risk of side effects.if ppis don’t control your symptoms, a medicine known as a h2ra may be recommended for you to take alongside them on a short-term basis, or as an alternative.like ppis, h2ras reduce the amount of acid produced by your stomach.side effects of h2ras are uncommon, but can include diarrhoea, headaches, dizziness, a rash and tiredness.surgery may be an option if: the above treatments don’t help, aren’t suitable for you, or cause troublesome side effects you don’t want to take medication on a long-term basisthe main procedure used is called a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (lnf). alternative techniques have been developed more recently, although these aren’t yet widely available.lnf is a type of laparoscopic or ‘keyhole’ surgery. this means it’s carried out using special surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the skin.the procedure is used to tighten the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus, which helps to stop acid leaking up from the stomach. it’s carried out in hospital undergeneral anaesthetic.most people need to stay in hospital for 2 or 3 days after the procedure. depending on your job, you may be able to return to work within 3 to 6 weeks.for the first 6 weeks after surgery, you should only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. some people experience problems with swallowing, belching and bloating after lnf, but these should get better with time.in the last few years, several new techniques for treating gord have been developed.thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)says these procedures appear to be safe, but not much is known about their long-term effects.these techniques include: endoscopic injection of bulking agents– where special filler is injected into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower. endoluminal gastroplication– where folds are sown into the ring of muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus to restrict how far it can open. endoscopic augmentation with hydrogel implants– where implants containing special gel are placed into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower. endoscopic radiofrequency ablation– where a tiny balloon is passed down to the bottom of the oesophagus and electrodes attached to it are used to heat it and make it narrower. laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic bead band (linx)– where a ring of magnetic beads are implanted around the lower part of the oesophagus to strengthen it and help keep it closed when not swallowing.speak to your surgeon about these techniques for more information.a number of possible complications can occur as a result of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) for a long time.the stomach acid that leaks into the oesophagus in people with gord can damage the lining of the oesophagus (oesophagitis), which can cause ulcers to form.these ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making it difficult to swallow.medications used to treat gord, such as proton pump inhibitors (ppis), can help ulcers heal by reducing the amount of acid that leaks into the oesophagus. read more abouttreatments for gord.repeated damage to the oesophagus by stomach acid can also cause it to become scarred and narrowed.this is known as oesophageal stricture and it can make swallowing difficult and painful.if this happens, a procedure to widen the oesophagus using a small balloon or other widening device may be recommended.repeated episodes of gord can sometimes lead to changes in the cells in the lining of your lower oesophagus. this is known as barrett’s oesophagus.it’s estimated that about 1 in every 10 people with gord will develop barrett’s oesophagus, usually after many years.barrett’s oesophagus doesn’t usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those caused by gord.however, there’s a small risk that the changed cells could become cancerous in the future (see below). your doctor may suggest having an endoscopy every few years to check for this.it’s estimated that 1 in every 10 to 20 people with barrett’s oesophagus will developoesophageal cancerwithin 10 to 20 years.symptoms of oesophageal cancer include: difficulty swallowing unexplained weight loss persistentindigestion hoarseness a

       " 'Germ cell tumours': 'most children who develop germ cell tumours will be cured.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.germ cell tumours can appear at any age. they develop from cells that produce eggs or sperm so germ cell tumours can affect the ovaries or testes. however, it’s possible for a germ cell tumour to develop in other parts of the body.as a baby develops during pregnancy, the cells producing eggs or sperm normally move to the ovaries or testes. however, occasionally they can settle in other parts of the body where they can develop into tumours. the most common places for this to happen are the bottom of the spine (sacrococcygeal), the brain, chest, and abdomen.germ cell tumours are sometimes given different names based on their characteristics. these include yolk-sac tumours, germinomas, embryonal carcinomas, mature teratomas and immature teratomas.they may be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). malignant tumours have the ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body.benign tumours do not spread but may cause problems by pressing on nearby tissue and organs.immature teratomas fall between benign and malignant. they can spread within the abdomen but not beyond, and can be removed with an operation.the cause of germ cell tumours is unknown but research into the causes of different cancers is ongoing.the symptoms depend on where the tumour develops. usually it starts with a lump that can either be felt or causes other symptoms.different tests may be needed to diagnose a germ cell tumour. usually, the doctor will remove a sample of tissue from the lump (abiopsy) for examination under a microscope to find out if it is a cancer or not.ctormri scansmay be used to see the exact position of a tumour within the body. chest x-rays may be taken to see if there’s a tumour in the lungs.germ cell tumours often produce proteins called tumour markers that can be measured in the blood. the ones that are produced by germ cell tumours are alpha-fetoprotein (afp) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hcg). your child will have blood tests to check these tumour markers when they are being diagnosed. the doctors will continue to check these during treatment and after treatment is over.sometimes a germ cell tumour can be diagnosed with a tumour marker and scan results so that a biopsy isn’t necessary. this is particularly so if surgery is not needed for treatment, for example if the tumour is in the brain.the stage of a cancer describes its size and whether it has spread from where it started. knowing the stage helps doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.generally cancer is divided into 4 stages:cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body and formed new tumours is known as secondary or metastatic cancer.the treatment your child will have usually depends on a number of factors, including the size, position and stage of the tumour. it usually includes either surgery or chemotherapy, or a combination.a benign tumour can be cured if it is removed by surgery. it may mean removing a testicle or an ovary if this is where the tumour started.if the tumour is malignant and can be completely removed with surgery,chemotherapyis not always needed, especially if it began in the testis or ovary. if the tumour cannot be removed easily or has spread, your child will be given chemotherapy.chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy. it’s usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein.a combination of drugs is usually given every 3 weeks for 3 or 5 months. the length of time chemotherapy is given for depends on the position of the tumour, the level of afp, and whether or not the tumour has spread.treatment of malignant germ cell tumours in the brain is a little different. although they are very sensitive to chemotherapy, treatment with radiotherapy is also needed.radiotherapyis the use of high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells. unlike germ cell tumours elsewhere in the body, it’s not always necessary to remove germ cell tumours in the brain with surgery.treatment often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. the operation your child has will be individually planned to try to reduce any possible problems. the surgeon and specialist nurse will discuss this with you.the side effects of chemotherapy usually gradually improve when treatment is over and many of them can be well controlled.the side effects of treatment depend on the drugs used but can include: feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness diarrhoeaa small number of children may develop long-term side effects of treatment, sometimes many years later. these are not common but may include problems with how the kidneys or lungs work and some hearing loss. your child’s specialist doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects.if your child has only one ovary or testis removed, they’ll usually still be able to have children in the future.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancers. if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. written information is often provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.your child will continue to have regular blood tests during and after treatment, to check their levels of afp and hcg. if the levels rise, this indicates that the tumour might have come back and further treatment is needed.if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support support your child.',\n",

teenagers and young adults.most ebv infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.however, if a person develops an ebv infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever.once you have had glandular fever, it’s unlikely you will develop it again. this is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection.to diagnose glandular fever, your gp will first ask about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. they’ll look for signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen.your gp may also recommend ablood testto help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (cmv), rubella, mumps and toxoplasmosis.there is no cure for glandular fever. but there are simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to control the infection.these include: drinking plenty of fluids taking over-the-counter painkillers, such asparacetamoloribuprofen getting plenty of rest and gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels

then passed into your white blood cells before spreading through the lymphatic system.this is a series of glands (nodes) found throughout your body that allows many of the cells that your immune system needs to travel around the body.after the infection has passed, people develop lifelong immunity to the virus and most won’t develop symptoms again.many people are first exposed to ebv during childhood, when the infection causes few symptoms and often goes unrecognised before it eventually passes.young adults may be most at risk of glandular fever because they might not have been exposed to the virus when they were younger, and the infection tends to produce more severe symptoms when you’re older.not everyone who can pass on ebv will have symptoms themselves. these are known as asymptomatic carriers.some people can have the virus in their saliva for a few months after recovering from glandular fever, and may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years.this is because the virus remains inactive in the body for the rest of your life after you have been exposed to it. for most people, the inactive virus won’t cause any symptoms.however, there is a chance of the virus periodically becoming reactivated, which may mean it re-enters the saliva. this reactivation may be without any symptoms, or it may cause symptoms to recur for a short time.there is currently no cure for glandular fever, but the symptoms should pass within a few weeks. there are things you can do to help control your symptoms.drink plenty of fluids (preferably water or unsweetened fruit juice) to avoiddehydration.avoid alcohol, as this could harm your liver, which may already be weakened from the infection.painkillers available over the counter, such asparacetamolornon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)such asibuprofen, can help reduce pain and fever.children under 16 years old should not take aspirin because there is a small risk it could trigger a rare but serious health condition called reye’s syndrome.regularly gargling with a solution of warm, salty water may also help relieve yoursore throat.take plenty of rest while you recover from glandular fever. complete bed rest is no longer recommended because it may make the fatigue last longer.you should gradually increase your activities as your energy levels return, but avoid activities you cannot manage comfortably.for the first month after your symptoms begin, avoid contact sports or activities that put you at risk of falling. this is because you may have a swollen spleen that it’s more vulnerable to damage, and a sudden knock could cause it to burst (rupture).there is no need to be isolated from others if you have glandular fever as most people will already be immune to the epstein-barr virus (ebv).you can return to work, college or school as soon as you feel well enough. there’s little risk of spreading the infection to others as long as you follow commonsense precautions while you are ill, such as not kissing other people or sharing utensils.it’s also important to thoroughly clean anything that may have been contaminated by saliva until you have recovered.antibioticsare not effective in treating glandular fever because they have no effect on viruses, but they may be prescribed if you also develop a bacterial infection of your throat or lungs(pneumonia).a short course ofcorticosteroidsmay also be helpful if: your tonsils are particularly swollen and are causing breathing difficulties you have severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) you have problems affecting your heart, such as pericarditis (inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart) you have problems affecting your brain or nerves, such as encephalitisread more about thecomplications of glandular fever.most people are able to recover from glandular fever at home, but hospital treatment may be necessary for a few days if you or your child: develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties find swallowing fluids difficult develop intense abdominal paintreatment in hospital may involve receiving fluids or antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenously), corticosteroid injections and pain relief.in a small number of cases, emergency surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy) may be needed if it ruptures.most people with glandular fever will recover in 2 or 3 weeks and won’t experience any further problems.however, complications can develop in a few cases.more than 1 in every 10 people with glandular fever will experience prolonged fatigue, which lasts for 6 months or more after the initial infection. it’s not known why fatigue lasts longer in some people.some experts think it may be a form ofchronic fatigue syndrome (cfs). this is a poorly understood condition that causes persistent fatigue and a range of other symptoms, such asheadachesand joint pain.adopting a gradual exercise plan to rebuild your strength and energy levels may help prevent and reduce prolonged fatigue.in a few cases, glandular fever can lead to a reduction in some blood cells. it can reduce levels of: red blood cells (anaemia) – this can make you feel tired and out of breath white blood cells (neutropenia) – this can make you more prone to developing a secondary infection platelets – this can make you bruise and bleed more easilyin most cases, the reduction in the number of blood cells is small and only causes mild symptoms. these problems should get better by themselves within a few weeks or months.around half of people who develop glandular fever will have a swollen spleen. this does not present any immediate health problems, but there is a small risk of it rupturing (bursting).the main sign of a ruptured spleen is sharp pain in the left of the tummy (abdomen).go to your local accident and emergency (a&e) department or phone 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you develop intense abdominal pain.the risk of the spleen rupturing is small, occurring in just 1 in every 500 to 1,000 cases of glandular fever, but it can be life threatening because it may cause severe internal bleeding.in some cases, emergency surgery may be required to remove an enlarged or ruptured spleen (splenectomy).a ruptured spleen usually occurs as a result of damage caused by vigorous physical activities, such as contact sports.it’s therefore very important to avoid these activities for at least a month after the symptoms of glandular fever begin.be particularly careful during the second and third week of your illness, as this is when the spleen is most vulnerable.in less than 1 in every 100 cases, the epstein-barr virus (ebv) can affect the nervous system and trigger a range of neurological complications, including: guillain-barré syndrome – where the nerves become inflamed, causing symptoms such as numbness, weakness and temporary paralysis bell’s palsy – where the muscles on one side of the face become temporarily weak or paralysed viralmeningitis– an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord; although unpleasant, viral meningitis is much less serious than bacterial meningitis, which is life threatening encephalitis – an infection of the brainthese complications will often need specific treatment, but more than four out of every five people with them will make a full recovery.in a small number of cases, the initial infection weakens your immune system and allows bacteria to infect parts of the body. this is called a secondary bacterial infection.possible secondary infections that can develop during glandular fever include serious conditions such aspneumonia(infection of the lung) and pericarditis (infection of the sac that surrounds the heart).secondary infections usually occur in people who have a very weak immune system, such as people withhiv or aids, or those havingchemotherapy.if you have a weakened immune system and you develop glandular fever, as a precaution you may be referred to hospital for specialist treatment. this will allow for your health to be carefully monitored and any secondary infections to be treated. self-help guide: fever in adults lab tests online uk',\n",

       " 'Gout': 'gout is a type of arthritis in which small crystals form inside and around the joints. it causes sudden attacks of severe pain and swelling.it’s estimated that between one and two in every 100 people in the uk are affected by gout.the condition mainly affects men over 30 and women after themenopause. overall, gout is more common in men than women.gout can be extremely painful and debilitating, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further attacks.any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers.signs and symptoms of gout include: severe pain in one or more joints the joint feeling hot and very tender swelling in and around the affected joint red, shiny skin over the affected jointsymptoms develop rapidly over a few hours and typically last three to 10 days. after this time the pain should pass and the joint should return to normal.almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point, usually within a year.read more about thesymptoms of gout.see your gp if you suspect you have gout and it hasn’t been previously diagnosed, particularly if the pain keeps getting worse and you also have a high temperature (fever).it’s important that a diagnosis is confirmed because other conditions that require urgent treatment, such as an infected joint, can sometimes cause similar symptoms.if you’ve already been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your gp if any medication you’ve been prescribed (see below) doesn’t start working within a couple of days.read more aboutdiagnosing gout.gout is caused by a build-up of a substance called uric acid in the blood.if you produce too much uric acid or your kidneys don’t filter enough out, it can build up and cause tiny sharp crystals to form in and around joints. these crystals can cause the joint to become inflamed (red and swollen) and painful.things that may increase your chances of getting gout include: obesity,high blood pressureand/ordiabetes having a close relative with gout kidney problems eating foods that cause a build-up of uric acid, such as red meat, offal and seafood drinking too much beer or spiritsread more about thecauses of gout.if you have gout, treatment is available from your gp to: relieve symptoms during an attack – this can be done using ice packs and by taking medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), colchicine orcorticosteroids prevent further attacks – through a combination of lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or changing your diet, and taking medication that lowers uric acid levels, such as allopurinolwith treatment, many people are able to reduce their uric acid levels sufficiently to dissolve the crystals that cause gout – and as a result have no further attacks. however, lifelong treatment is usually required.read more abouttreating gout.sometimes gout can lead to further problems, particularly if it’s left untreated.these can include: kidney stones small firm lumps of uric acid crystals under the skin called tophi permanent joint damageread more about thecomplications of gout.pseudogout is a similar condition to gout, but usually affects the knee joint first. it’s a form of arthritis that causes pain, stiffness, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling in one or more of your joints – commonly the knee or wrist.gout is caused by small crystals forming in the joints, resulting in severe pain, tenderness and swelling.these crystals can grow when a waste product called uric acid starts to build up to high levels in the body.uric acid is created when the body breaks down chemicals known as purines.if your kidneys don’t filter out enough uric acid, or your body is producing unusually high levels of it, it can build up in the body and turn into microscopic crystals.these crystals usually form in and around the joints, possibly because the temperature in these areas is slightly lower than the rest of the body. if they get into the space between joints, the crystals can cause painful inflammation (redness and swelling).a high level of uric acid in the blood is the main factor that increases your risk of developing gout. however, it’s still uncertain why some people with a high level of uric acid in the blood develop gout, while others with an equally high level don’t.other factors that may increase your risk of developing gout are outlined below.some underlying medical conditions can increase your risk of developing gout, including: high blood pressure diabetes kidney disease high levels of fat and cholesterolin your blood obesity metabolic syndrome (a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity) psoriasis(a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales) osteoarthritiscertain medications can increase your uric acid levels and your risk of developing gout. these include: diuretics (water tablets) – used to treat high blood pressure or an abnormal build-up of fluid in your body certain medicines used to treat high blood pressure – includingbeta-blockersand ace inhibitors low-dose aspirin– used to reduce the risk ofblood clots niacin – used to treat high cholesterol ciclosporin – used to treat conditions such as psoriasis somechemotherapymedicinesuric acid is created when the body breaks down purines. eating foods that contain a high level of purines can increase your risk of gout.foods naturally high in purines include: red meat – such as beef, lamb and pork seafood – especially shellfish and oily fish offal – such as liver, kidneys and heartalcoholic drinks can raise the level of uric acid in the blood.beer, fortified wines like port, and spirits do this more than wine. moderate consumption of wine – one or two glasses a day – shouldn’t significantly increase your risk of gout.certain sugary drinks may also increase your risk of gout.some research has found that drinking sugar-sweetened soft drinks and drinks with high levels of fructose (a naturally occurring sugar found in many fruits) had an increased risk of gout.studies have shown that gout often runs in families. around one in five people with gout have a close family member with the condition.the main symptom of gout is a sudden attack of severe pain in one or more joints, typically your big toe.other symptoms can include: the joint feeling hot and very tender, to the point of being unable to bear anything touching it swelling in and around the affected joint red, shiny skin over the affected joint peeling, itchy and flaky skin as the swelling goes downthe intense pain can make getting around difficult. even the light pressure of a bed cover or blanket can be unbearable.gout can affect almost any joint and can occur in more than one joint at the same time.the joints towards the ends of the limbs tend to be affected more often, including the: toes – particularly the big toe joint midfoot (where your shoelaces sit) ankles knees fingers wrists elbowsif gout is left untreated, it’s likely to affect more joints over time.attacks of gout tend to: occur at night, although they can happen at any time develop quickly over a few hours last between three and 10 days – after this time, the affected joint should start to return to normal, but the problem can persist if treatment isn’t started early come back – you may experience attacks every few months or years become more frequent over time if not treatedit’s difficult to predict how often attacks will occur and when exactly they will happen.see your gp if you suspect you have gout and it hasn’t been previously diagnosed.contact your gp immediately or call the111service if you have both: severe, worsening joint pain and swelling a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or abovethis could mean you have an infection inside the joint (septic arthritis).if you’ve already been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your gp if any medication you’ve been prescribed doesn’t start working within a couple of days.read more aboutdiagnosing goutandtreating gout.your gp may suspect gout based on your symptoms. sometimes further tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes.see your gp if you experiencesymptoms of goutfor the first time.your gp will ask about your symptoms and medical history, and examine the affected area, to help make a diagnosis.they may also ask you about your diet, particularly your intake of beer, spirits and foods high in purines, such as red meat and seafood.many conditions can cause gout-like symptoms.your gp may be unable to make a firm diagnosis straight away and you may be referred for further tests. these will either confirm the diagnosis of gout or rule out other conditions.a sample of fluid may be taken from the affected joint. the fluid can be checked for the small crystals that cause gout, and it can be tested for infection to rule out septic arthritis.ablood testknown as a serum uric acid test may be used to measure the amount of uric acid in your blood. a high level or uric acid is often associated with gout.it’s sometimes best to wait until two to four weeks after an attack of gout before this test is carried out, as the level of uric acid in your blood is often not raised at the time of an attack. this is because the level of uric acid in your blood can drop when uric acid crystals form in the joints.anx-rayis rarely used to diagnose gout because the condition isn’t usually detectable using this method.however, an x-ray is sometimes used to help rule out similar conditions that affect the joints, such as chondrocalcinosis (a build-up of calcium crystals in the joints) or to assess whether there has been any joint damage due to repeated or persistent attacks of gout.anultrasound scanof an affected joint is a simple and safe investigation that’s increasingly used to detect crystals in the joints. it can also detect crystals deep in the skin that aren’t obvious during a physical examination.treatment for gout includes pain relief to help you cope with a gout attack, as well as medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks.you should: take any medication you’ve been prescribed as early as possible after you notice an attack (see below) – this should start to have an effect within two or three days rest and raise the limb avoid knocking or damaging the affected joint keep the joint cool – remove surrounding clothing and apply an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel ensure you’re well hydratedapply the ice pack to your joint for around 20 minutes. don’t apply ice directly to your skin and don’t apply it for more than 20 minutes at a time because this could damage the skin.if necessary, you can keep reapplying an ice pack to your skin during an attack, but you should wait until your skin has returned to a normal temperature first.non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)are usually recommended as the first treatment for gout. they work by reducing pain and inflammation during an attack.nsaids used to treat gout include naproxen, diclofenac and etoricoxib.if you’ve been prescribed nsaids, it’s a good idea to have them with you at all times so you can use them at the first sign of a gout attack. continue to take your medication throughout the attack and for 48 hours afterwards.your gp may also prescribe a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (ppi), to take alongside your nsaid. this reduces the risk of the nsaid causingindigestion,stomach ulcersand bleeding from the stomach.if you’re unable to take nsaids or if nsaids are ineffective, a medicine called colchicine can be used instead.colchicine reduces some of the swelling and pain associated with a gout attack.it’s best to have it with you at all times so you can use it at the first sign of a gout attack. your gp will tell you how long to take it for and how often.when taken in high doses, side effects of colchicine include feeling sick, abdominal (tummy) pain anddiarrhoea.corticosteroidsare sometimes used to treat severe cases of gout if other treatments don’t work or you’re unable to take an nsaid or colchicine.a short course of steroid tablets often provides relief, but they can’t be used long-term in high doses as they cause side effects, including: weight gain thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) easy bruising muscle weaknesscorticosteroids can also be given by injection to provide rapid pain relief. this can be either into a muscle, a vein or directly into the affected joint.you can reduce your chances of having further gout attacks by taking medication and making lifestyle changes to reduce the level of uric acid in your body.medication to reduce uric acid levels – known as urate-lowering therapy (ult) – is usually recommended if you have recurrent attacks of gout or you havecomplications of gout.most people with gout will eventually need to have ult, so you may want to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this treatment with your doctor as soon as you’ve been diagnosed with gout.they should explain that while ult can significantly reduce your risk of having further attacks, the medication needs to be taken on a daily basis for the rest of your life and there’s a small risk of side effects.if you decide to start ult, a medicine called allopurinol is usually tried first. if this isn’t suitable or doesn’t work, other medications may be used instead. these medications are described below.allopurinol helps reduce the production of uric acid. it can help prevent gout attacks, although it won’t help relieve symptoms during an attack.allopurinol is a tablet taken once a day. when you first start taking it, your dose will be adjusted to make sure the level of uric acid in your blood is low enough. regularblood testswill be needed to monitor this until the most effective dose is found.allopurinol can sometimes cause a gout attack soon after you start taking it and it can take up to a year or two before no further attacks occur. it’s important to persevere with treatment even if you do have attacks during this time.to help relieve attacks, your doctor will prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described above to take alongside your allopurinol at first.most people taking allopurinol won’t experience any significant side effects. however, side effects can include: a rash – this is usually mild and goes away on its own, but it can be a sign of an allergy; if you develop a rash, stop taking the medication immediately and contact your gp for advice indigestion headaches diarrhoealike allopurinol, febuxostat is a medication taken once a day that reduces the body’s production of uric acid. it’s often used if allopurinol isn’t suitable or causes troublesome side effects.as with allopurinol, febuxostat can make your symptoms worse when you first start taking it. your doctor will initially prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described in case you experience attacks.side effects of febuxostat can include: diarrhoea feeling sick headaches a rashless commonly used ult medications include benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone.these types of medication tend to only be used if people are unable to take allopurinol or febuxostat. they need to be prescribed under the supervision of a specialist.certain lifestyle changes can also help reduce your risk of experiencing further attacks of gout, including: avoiding foods containing high levels of purine (the chemical involved in the production of uric acid), such as red meat, offal, oily fish, seafood and foods containing yeast extract. avoiding sugary drinks and snacks – these are associated with an increased risk of gout maintaining a healthy weight – follow abalanced diet; don’t crash diet or try high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets taking regular exercise – try activities that don’t put too much strain on your joints, such as swimming drinking plenty of water – keeping yourself well hydrated will reduce the risk of crystals forming in your joints cutting down on alcohol – avoid beer and spirits in particular and don’t binge drinkthere’s some evidence to suggest that taking regularvitamin csupplements can reduce gout attacks, although the effect may only be small. talk to your gp first if you’re thinking about taking vitamin c supplements, as they aren’t suitable or safe for everyone.complications of gout can include small lumps forming under the skin (tophi), joint damage and kidney stones. these are more likely to occur if gout is left untreated.gout is caused by a chemical called uric acid forming small crystals in and around the joints. these crystals also often build up under the skin and form small white or yellow lumps known as tophi.tophi are usually painless, but they can form in awkward places, such as at the ends of your fingers and around your toes. sometimes they can make everyday tasks such as preparing food or getting dressed difficult.they can also can become inflamed and produce a toothpaste-like discharge.tophi can develop anywhere in the body, but usually form on the: toes heels knees fingers ears forearms elbowsit normally takes several years after the first attack of gout for tophi to develop, but some people develop them even before experiencing an attack. they’re usually a sign of severe gout and a good reason to starttreatment to reduce the level or uric acid in your body.successful treatment will prevent the tophi from getting any bigger, and long term treatment often gradually shrinks them.if you have very large or painful tophi, they may have to be surgically removed.without treatment, gout attacks may become more frequent and prolonged, and your likelihood of developing permanent joint damage will increase.in the most serious cases, surgery may be required to repair or replace a damaged joint.occasionally, high levels of uric acid can lead to the formation ofkidney stones.some kidney stones interfere with the flow of urine, resulting in pain when you pass urine, and can make you feel that you need to pass urine more often.you may be prescribed medication to make your urine less acidic, which should help dissolve any kidney stones that have developed. read more abouttreating kidney stones.gout can also affect your mood, work and home life. the severe pain that gout causes can make it difficult to do everyday tasks and to get around, which in turn can lead to feelings ofdepressionoranxiety.if gout is affecting your mood or making everyday life difficult, talk to your gp. they will be able to offer treatment and support.there are also a number of organisations that offer information and advice for people who have gout, includingversus arthritis.

you shouldread our advice on dental emergencies.gum disease is a very common condition where the gums become swollen, sore or infected.most adults in the uk have gum disease to some degree and most people experience it at least once. it’s much less common in children.if you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. this early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis.if gingivitis isn’t treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. this affects more tissues that support teeth and hold them in place.if periodontitis isn’t treated, the bone in your jaw may be damaged and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out.read more about thesymptoms of gum disease.gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria.some bacteria in plaque are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums. if you don’t remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it builds up and irritates your gums. this can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness.read more about the causes of gum disease.you should make an appointment to see your dentist if your gums are painful, swollen or if they bleed when you brush your teeth.find a dentist near you.your dentist can carry out a thorough dental examination to check the health of your gums, which may involve inserting a thin metal stick with a bend in one end (periodontal probe) beside your teeth.in some cases, a number ofx-raysmay be needed to check the condition of your teeth and jaw bone.mild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. this includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. you should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups.in most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). they’ll also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future.if you have severe gum disease, you’ll usually need to have further medical and dental treatment and, in some cases, surgery may need to be carried out. this will usually be performed by a specialist in gum problems (periodontics).read more abouttreating gum disease and keeping your teeth clean.it’s important to have regular dental check-ups so any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early.if you’ve never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every 1 to 2 years for a check-up.you may need to visit your dentist more frequently if you’ve had problems with gum disease in the past. at each appointment your dentist will advise when you need your next appointment.if you have an increased risk of developing gum problems – for example, if you smoke or havediabetes– you may be advised to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums can be closely monitored.if you have untreated gum disease that develops into periodontitis, it can lead to further complications, such as: gum abscesses(painful collections of pus) receding gums loose teeth loss of teethread more about thecomplications of gum disease.healthy gums should be pink, firm and keep your teeth securely in place. your gums shouldn’t bleed when you touch or brush them.gum disease isn’t always painful and you may be unaware you have it. it’s important to have regulardental check-ups.the initial symptoms of gum disease can include: red and swollen gums bleeding gums after brushing or flossing your teeththis stage of gum disease is called gingivitis.if gingivitis is untreated, the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected. this is known as periodontitis, or periodontal disease.symptoms of periodontitis can include: bad breath (halitosis) an unpleasant taste in your mouth loose teeth that can make eating difficult gum abscesses(collections of pus that develop under your gums or teeth)in rare cases, a condition called acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (anug) can develop suddenly. the symptoms of anug are usually more severe than those of gum disease and can include: bleeding, painful gums painful ulcers receding gums inbetween your teeth bad breath a metallic taste in your mouth excess saliva in your mouth difficulty swallowing or talking a high temperature (fever)you should make an appointment to see your dentist if you think you may have gum disease or anug.if you don’t currently have a dentist,search for a dentist near you.read more abouttreating gum disease.gum disease can be caused by a number of factors, but poor oral hygiene is the most common cause.poor oral hygiene, such as not brushing your teeth properly or regularly, can cause plaque to build up on your teeth.your mouth is full of bacteria that combine with saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque, which builds up on your teeth.when you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates (sugary or starchy foods), bacteria in plaque turn carbohydrates into the energy they need, producing acid at the same time.over time, acid in plaque begins to break down your tooth’s surface and causes tooth decay.other bacteria in plaque can also irritate your gums, making them inflamed and sore.plaque is usually easy to remove by brushing and flossing your teeth, but it can harden and form a substance called tartar if it’s not removed. tartar sticks much more firmly to teeth than plaque and can usually only be removed by a dentist or dental hygienist.as well as poor oral hygiene, a number of things can increase your risk of developing problems with your gums. these include: smoking your age – gum disease becomes more common as you get older a family history of gum disease diabetes– a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood sugar levels to become too high a weakened immune system – for example, because of conditions such ashiv and aidsor certain treatments, such aschemotherapy malnutrition– a condition that occurs when a person’s diet does not contain the right amount of nutrients stressthe best way to treat gum disease is to practise good oral hygiene, although additional dental and medical treatments are sometimes necessary.good oral hygiene involves: brushing your teeth for about 2 minutes last thing at night before you go to bed and on one other occasion everyday – it doesn’t matter if you use an electric or manual toothbrush but some people find it easier to clean their teeth thoroughly with an electric toothbrush using toothpaste that contains the right amount offluoride(a natural mineral that helps protect againsttooth decay) flossingyour teeth regularly – preferably daily, before brushing your teeth not smoking regularly visiting your dentist – at least once every 1 to 2 years, but more frequently if necessarysee theteeth cleaning guidefor more information and advice about how to keep your teeth clean.antiseptic mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine or hexetidine are available over the counter from pharmacies. however, there’s some debate about whether using mouthwash is necessary for people with healthy gums.your dentist may recommend using mouthwash if it helps control the build-up of plaque (the sticky substance that forms when bacteria collects on the surface of your teeth). your dentist will be able to advise you about which type of mouthwash is most suitable and how to use it.chlorhexidine mouthwash can stain your teeth brown if you use it regularly. rinse your mouth thoroughly between brushing your teeth and using a chlorhexidine mouthwash because some ingredients in toothpaste can prevent the mouthwash working.some of the dental treatments described below may also be recommended if you have gum disease.to remove plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) that can build up on your teeth, your dentist may suggest that you have your teeth scaled and polished. this is a ‘professional clean’ usually carried out at your dental surgery by a dental hygienist.the dental hygienist will scrape away plaque and tartar from your teeth using special instruments, then polish your teeth to remove marks or stains. if a lot of plaque or tartar has built up, you may need to have more than one scale and polish.the price of a scale and polish can vary depending on what needs to be carried out, so ask your dental hygienist how much it will cost beforehand.in some cases of gum disease, root planing (debridement) may be required. this is a deep clean under the gums that gets rid of bacteria from the roots of your teeth.before having the treatment, you may need to have alocal anaesthetic(painkilling medication) to numb the area. you may experience some pain and discomfort for up to 48 hours after having root planing.if you have severe gum disease, you may need further treatment, such as periodontal surgery. in some cases, it’s necessary to remove the affected tooth. your dentist will be able to tell you about the procedure needed and how it’s carried out. if necessary, they can refer you to a specialist.if you’re having surgery or root planing, you may be given antibiotics (medication to treat infections). your dentist will tell you whether this is necessary.acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (anug) should always be treated by a dentist. however, if you see your gp before visiting a dentist, they may provide you with some treatment while you wait to see your dentist.as well as oral hygiene advice and dental treatments, treatments for anug may also include antibiotics, painkillers and different types of mouthwash.treatment withantibiotics, such as metronidazole or amoxicillin, may be recommended if you have anug. you’ll usually have to take these for 3 days.amoxicillin isn’t suitable for people allergic to penicillin. metronidazole can react with alcohol, causing you to feel very unwell. you shouldn’t drink alcohol while you’re taking metronidazole and for 48 hours after you finish the course of treatment.other side effects of metronidazole and amoxicillin can include nausea (feeling sick), vomiting anddiarrhoea.paracetamolandibuprofenare the most commonly prescribed painkillers. they’re also available over the counter from pharmacies. they may help reduce pain and discomfort.however, paracetamol and ibuprofen aren’t suitable for everyone, so read the manufacturer’s instructions before taking them.mouthwash containing chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide may be prescribed to treat anug. some chlorhexidine mouthwashes are also available over the counter, though they may not be as effective as a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash.you should always read the instructions before using mouthwash. some types may need to be diluted in water before they’re taken.if you develop gingivitis and don’t have the plaque or tartar (hardened plaque) removed from your teeth, the condition may get worse and lead to periodontitis.you may develop further complications if you don’t treat periodontitis (where the tissue that supports teeth is affected), including: recurrentgum abscesses(painful collections of pus) increasing damage to the periodontal ligament (the tissue that connects the tooth to the socket) increasing damage to and loss of the alveolar bone (the bone in the jaw that contains the sockets of the teeth) receding gums loose teeth loss of teethif you have acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (anug) and it’s not treated, it can cause more severe complications.the infection can spread to all areas of your gums and the alveolar bone surrounding your teeth. this can lead to: the gums between your teeth being completely destroyed large ulcers (open sores) leaving permanent holes in your gums loose and unstable teethif anug isn’t properly treated the first time you have it, you’re more likely to have recurring cases in the future. this can cause persistent bad breath (halitosis) and bleeding gums, as well as gradually receding gums.in rare cases, anug can lead to gangrene affecting the lips and cheeks. this occurs when tissue starts to die and waste away. if you develop gangrene, you may need to have the dead tissue removed.gum disease has also been associated with an increased risk for a number of other health conditions, including: cardiovascular disease lung infections if affected during pregnancy,premature labourand having a baby with a low birth weighthowever, while people with gum disease may have an increased risk of these problems, there isn’t currently any clear evidence that gum disease directly causes them. dental

       " 'Haemorrhoids (piles)': 'haemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels that are found inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus).in many cases, haemorrhoids don’t cause symptoms, and some people don’t even realise they have them. however, when symptoms do occur, they may include: bleeding after passing a stool (the blood is usually bright red) itchy bottom a lump hanging down outside of the anus, which may need to be pushed back in after passing a stool a mucus discharge after passing a stool soreness, redness and swelling around your anushaemorrhoids aren’t usually painful, unless their blood supply slows down or is interrupted.see your gp if you have persistent or severe symptoms of haemorrhoids. you should always get any rectal bleeding checked out, so your doctor can rule out more potentially serious causes.the symptoms of haemorrhoids often clear up on their own or with simple treatments that can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription. however, speak to your gp if your symptoms don’t get better or if you experience pain or bleeding.your gp can often diagnose haemorrhoids using a simple internal examination of your back passage, although they may need to refer you to a colorectal specialist for diagnosis and treatment.some people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their gp. however, there’s no need to be embarrassed, because gps are very used to diagnosing and treating haemorrhoids.read more aboutdiagnosing haemorrhoids.the exact cause of haemorrhoids is unclear, but they’re associated with increased pressure in the blood vessels in and around your anus. this pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed.many cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet, due to prolongedconstipation– this is often due to a lack of fibre in a person’s diet. chronic (long-term)diarrhoeacan also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids.other factors that might increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids include: being overweight orobese age – as you get older, your body’s supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of haemorrhoids being pregnant – which can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (read more aboutcommon pregnancy problems) having a family history of haemorrhoids regularly lifting heavy objects a persistentcoughor repeated vomiting sitting down for long periods of timehaemorrhoid symptoms often settle down after a few days, without needing treatment. haemorrhoids that occur during pregnancy often get better after giving birth.however, making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended. these can include: gradually increasing the amount of fibre in your diet – good sources of fibre include fruit, vegetables, wholegrain rice, wholewheat pasta and bread, pulses and beans, seeds, nuts and oats drinking plenty of fluid – particularly water, but avoiding or cutting down on caffeine andalcohol not delaying going to the toilet – ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier, which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet avoiding medication that causes constipation – such as painkillers that contain codeine losing weight(if you’re overweight) exercising regularly– can help prevent constipation, reduce your blood pressure and help you lose weightthese measures can also reduce the risk of haemorrhoids returning, or even developing in the first place.medication that you apply directly to your back passage (known as topical treatments) or tablets bought from a pharmacy or prescribed by your gp may ease your symptoms and make it easier for you to pass stools.there are various treatment options for more severe haemorrhoids. one of these options is banding, which is a non-surgical procedure where a very tight elastic band is put around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off its blood supply. the haemorrhoid should fall off after about a week.surgery carried out undergeneral anaesthetic(where you’re unconscious) is sometimes used to remove or shrink large or external haemorrhoids.read more abouttreating haemorrhoidsandsurgery for haemorrhoids.your gp can diagnose haemorrhoids (piles) by examining your back passage to check for swollen blood vessels.some people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their gp. however, there’s no need to be embarrassed – all gps are used to diagnosing and treating piles.it’s important to tell your gp about all of your symptoms – for example, tell them if you’ve recently lost a lot of weight, if your bowel movements have changed, or if your stools have become dark or sticky.your gp may examine the outside of your anus to see if you have visible haemorrhoids, and they may also carry out an internal examination called a digital rectal examination (dre).during a dre, your gp will wear gloves and use lubricant. using their finger, they’ll feel for any abnormalities in your back passage. a dre shouldn’t be painful, but you may feel some slight discomfort.in some cases, further internal examination using a proctoscope may be needed. a proctoscope is a thin hollow tube with a light on the end that’s inserted into your anus.this allows your doctor to see your entire anal canal (the last section of the large intestine).gps are sometimes able to carry out a proctoscopy. however, not all gps have the correct training or access to the right equipment, so you may need to go to a hospital clinic to have the procedure.after you’ve had a rectal examination or proctoscopy, your doctor will be able to determine what type of haemorrhoids you have.haemorrhoids can develop internally or externally. internal haemorrhoids develop in the upper two-thirds of your anal canal and external haemorrhoids in the lower third (closest to your anus). the nerves in the lower part can transmit pain messages, while the nerves in the upper part can’t.haemorrhoids can be further classified, depending on their size and severity. they can be: first degree – small swellings that develop on the inside lining of the anus and aren’t visible from outside the anus second degree – larger swellings that may come out of your anus when you go to the toilet, before disappearing inside again third degree – one or more small soft lumps that hang down from the anus and can be pushed back inside (prolapsing and reducible) fourth degree – larger lumps that hang down from the anus and can’t be pushed back inside (irreducible)it’s useful for doctors to know what type and size of haemorrhoid you have, as they can then decide on the best treatment.read more abouttreating haemorrhoids.haemorrhoids (piles) often clear up by themselves after a few days. however, there are many treatments that can reduce itching and discomfort.making simple dietary changes and not straining on the toilet are often recommended first.creams, ointments and suppositories (which you insert into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. they can be used to relieve any swelling and discomfort.if more intensive treatment is needed, the type will depend on where your haemorrhoids are in your anal canal – the lower third (closest to your anus) or the upper two-thirds. the lower third contain nerves which can transmit pain, while the upper two-thirds do not.non-surgical treatments for haemorrhoids in the lower part of the canal are likely to be very painful, because the nerves in this area can detect pain. in these cases,haemorrhoid surgerywill usually be recommended.the various treatments for haemorrhoids are outlined below.ifconstipationis thought to be the cause of your haemorrhoids, you need to keep your stools soft and regular, so that you don’t strain when passing stools.you can do this by increasing the amount of fibre in your diet. good sources of fibre include wholegrain bread, cereal, fruit and vegetables.you should also drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine (found in tea, coffee and cola).when going to the toilet, you should: avoid straining to pass stools, because it may make your haemorrhoids worse use moist toilet paper, rather than dry toilet paper, or baby wipes to clean your bottom after passing a stool pat the area around your bottom, rather than rubbing itread more aboutpreventing constipation.various creams, ointments and suppositories (which are inserted into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. they can be used to relieve any swelling and discomfort.these medicines should only be used for five to seven days at a time. if you use them for longer, they may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus. any medication should be combined with the diet and self-care advice discussed above.there’s no evidence to suggest that one method is more effective than another. ask your pharmacist for advice about which product is most suitable for you, and always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine before using it.don’t use more than one product at once.if you have severe inflammation in and around your back passage, your gp may prescribecorticosteroid cream, which contains steroids.you shouldn’t use corticosteroid cream for more than a week at a time, because it can make the skin around your anus thinner and the irritation worse.common painkilling medication, such asparacetamol, can help relieve the pain of haemorrhoids.however, if you have excessive bleeding, avoid using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such asibuprofen, because it can make rectal bleeding worse. you should also avoid using codeine painkillers, because they can cause constipation.your gp may prescribe products that containlocal anaestheticto treat painful haemorrhoids. like over-the-counter topical treatments, these should only be used for a few days, because they can make the skin around your back passage more sensitive.if you’re constipated, your gp may prescribe alaxative. laxatives are a type of medicine that can help you empty your bowels.if dietary changes and medication don’t improve your symptoms, your gp may refer you to a specialist. they can confirm whether you have haemorrhoids and recommend appropriate treatment.if you have haemorrhoids in the upper part of your anal canal, non-surgical procedures such as banding and sclerotherapy may be recommended.banding involves placing a very tight elastic band around the base of your haemorrhoids to cut off their blood supply. the haemorrhoids should then fall off within about a week of having the treatment.banding is usually a day procedure that doesn’t need an anaesthetic, and most people can get back to their normal activities the next day. you may feel some pain or discomfort for a day or so afterwards. normal painkillers are usually adequate, but your gp can prescribe something stronger, if needed.you may not realise that your haemorrhoids have fallen off, as they should pass out of your body when you go to the toilet. if you notice some mucus discharge within a week of the procedure, it usually means that the haemorrhoids have fallen off.directly after the procedure, you may notice blood on the toilet paper after going to the toilet. this is normal, but there shouldn’t be a lot of bleeding. if you pass a lot of bright red blood or blood clots (solid lumps of blood), go to your nearest accident and emergency (a&e) department immediately.ulcers (open sores) can occur at the site of the banding, although these usually heal without needing further treatment.a treatment called sclerotherapy may be used as an alternative to banding.during sclerotherapy, a chemical solution is injected into the blood vessels in your back passage. this relieves pain by numbing the nerve endings at the site of the injection. it also hardens the tissue of the haemorrhoid so that a scar is formed. after about 4 to 6 weeks, the haemorrhoid should decrease in size or shrivel up.after the injection, you should avoid strenuous exercise for the rest of the day. you may experience minor pain for a while and may bleed a little. you should be able to resume normal activities, including work, the day after the procedure.electrotherapy, also known as electrocoagulation, is another alternative to banding for people with smaller haemorrhoids.during the procedure, a device called a proctoscope is inserted into the anus to locate the haemorrhoid. an electric current is then passed through a small metal probe that’s placed at the base of the haemorrhoid, above the dentate line. the specialist can control the electric current using controls attached to the probe.the aim of electrotherapy is to cause the blood supplying the haemorrhoid to coagulate (thicken), which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink. if necessary, more than one haemorrhoid can be treated during each session.electrotherapy can either be carried out on outpatient basis using a low electric current, or a higher dose can be given while the person is under ageneral anaestheticor spinal anaesthetic.you may experience some mild pain during or after electrotherapy, but in most cases this doesn’t last long. rectal bleeding is another possible side effect of the procedure, but this is usually short-lived.electrotherapy is recommended by the national institute for health and care excellence (nice), and has been shown to be an effective method of treating smaller haemorrhoids. it can also be used as an alternative to surgery for treating larger haemorrhoids, but there’s less evidence of its effectiveness.although most haemorrhoids can be treated using the methods described above, around 1 in every 10 people will eventually need surgery.surgery is particularly useful for haemorrhoids that have developed below the dentate line because, unlike non-surgical treatments, anaesthetic is used to ensure you don’t feel any pain.there are many different types of surgery that can be used to treat haemorrhoids, but they all usually involve either removing the haemorrhoids or reducing their blood supply, causing them to shrink.read more aboutsurgery for haemorrhoids.surgery may be recommended if other treatments for haemorrhoids (piles) haven’t worked, or if you have haemorrhoids that aren’t suitable for non-surgical treatment.there are many different surgical procedures for piles.a haemorrhoidectomy is an operation to remove haemorrhoids. it’s usually carried out undergeneral anaesthetic, which means you’ll be unconscious during the procedure and won’t feel any pain while it’s carried out.a conventional haemorrhoidectomy involves gently opening the anus so the haemorrhoids can be cut out. you’ll need to take a week or so off work to recover.you’ll probably experience significant pain after the operation, but you will be given painkillers. you may still have pain a few weeks after the procedure, which can also be controlled with painkillers. seek medical advice if you have pain that continues for longer.after having a haemorrhoidectomy, there’s around a 1 in 20 chance of the haemorrhoids returning, which is lower than with non-surgical treatments. adopting or continuing a high-fibre diet after surgery is recommended to reduce this risk.haemorrhoidal artery ligation is an operation to reduce the blood flow to your haemorrhoids.it’s usually carried out under general anaesthetic and involves inserting a smallultrasoundprobe into your anus. the probe produces high-frequency sound waves that allow the surgeon to locate the vessels supplying blood to the haemorrhoid.each blood vessel is stitched closed to block the blood supply to the haemorrhoid, which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink over the following days and weeks. the stitches can also be used to reduce prolapsing haemorrhoids (haemorrhoids that hang down from the anus).the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends haemorrhoidal artery ligation as a safe and effective alternative to a haemorrhoidectomy or stapled haemorrhoidopexy (see below). it causes less pain and, in terms of results, a high level of satisfaction has been reported.the recovery time after having haemorrhoidal artery ligation is also quicker compared with other surgical procedures. there’s a low risk of bleeding, pain when passing stools, or the haemorrhoid becoming prolapsed after this procedure, but these usually improve within a few weeks.stapling, also known as stapled haemorrhoidopexy, is an alternative to a conventional haemorrhoidectomy. it’s sometimes used to treat prolapsed haemorrhoids and is carried out under general anaesthetic.the procedure isn’t carried out as often as it used to be, because it has a slightly higher risk of serious complications than the alternative treatments available.during the operation, part of the anorectum (the last section of the large intestine), is stapled. this means the haemorrhoids are less likely to prolapse and it reduces the supply of blood to the haemorrhoids, which causes them to gradually shrink.stapling has a shorter recovery time than a traditional haemorrhoidectomy, and you can probably return to work about a week afterwards. it also tends to be a less painful procedure.however, after stapling, more people experience another prolapsed haemorrhoid compared with having a haemorrhoidectomy. there have also been a very small number of serious complications following the stapling procedure, such as fistula to vagina in women (where a small channel develops between the anal canal and the vagina) or rectal perforation (where a hole develops in the rectum).other treatment options are available, including freezing and laser treatment. however, the number of nhs or private surgeons who perform these treatments is limited.although the risk of serious problems is small, complications can occasionally occur after haemorrhoid surgery. these can include: bleeding or passing blood clots, which may happen a week or so after the operation infection, which may lead to a build-up of pus (known as an abscess) – you may be given a short course ofantibioticsafter surgery to reduce this risk urinary retention (difficulty emptying your bladder) faecal incontinence(the involuntarily passing of stools) anal fistula (a small channel that develops between the anal canal and surface of the skin, near the anus) stenosis (narrowing of the anal canal) – this risk is highest if you have treatment on haemorrhoids that have developed in a ring around the lining of the anal canalthese problems can often be treated with medication or more surgery. ask your surgeon to explain the risks in more detail before deciding to have surgery.seek medical advice from the hospital unit where the surgery was carried out, or from your gp, if you experience: excessive bleeding a high temperature (fever) problems urinating worsening pain or swelling around your anusif you’re unable to contact the hospital or

school children aged 4 to 11.they’re largely harmless, but can live in the hair for a long time if not treated and can be irritating and frustrating to deal with.head lice can be difficult to spot, even when the head is closely inspected.they’re very small whitish or grey-brown insects that range from the size of a pinhead to the size of a sesame seed.less reliable signs of head lice include:the only way to be sure someone has head lice is to find a live louse by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed comb. this is called detection combing.you can buy detection combsfrom your local pharmacy, supermarket or online. combs with flat-faced teeth spaced 0.2 to 0.3mm apart are best for removing head lice, although combs with smaller gaps can be used to remove eggs and nits (egg cases) after treatment.detection combing can be carried out on dry or wet hair. dry combing takes less time, but wet combing is more accurate because washing with conditioner stops head lice from moving.to use the wet detection method: wash the hair with ordinary shampoo apply plenty of conditioner use an ordinary, wide-toothed comb to straighten and untangle the hair once the comb moves freely through the hair without dragging, switch to the louse detection comb make sure the teeth of the comb slot into the hair at the roots, with the edge of the teeth lightly touching the scalp draw the comb down from the roots to the ends of the hair with every stroke, and check the comb for lice each time – remove lice by wiping the comb with tissue paper or rinsing it work through the hair, section by section, so that the whole head of hair is combed through do this at least twice to help ensure you haven’t missed any areas continue until you find no more liceif you find head lice, you should check

       " 'Hiatus hernia': 'a hiatus hernia, or hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (‘hiatus’) in the diaphragm.the diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle between the chest and the abdomen (tummy).a hiatus hernia itself rarely has any noticeable symptoms. however, it can cause a problem calledgastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord).gord is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). it can occur if a hiatus hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus from working properly.your oesophagus can become severely irritated, because it’s not protected against stomach acid. this can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems (dysphagia).you should see your gp if you have frequent and severesymptoms of gord.it’s not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernia, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age, or pressure on the abdomen.hiatus hernia can sometimes occur in newborn babies if the stomach or diaphragm doesn’t develop properly.hiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it’s more common in people who are: over 50 years of age overweight pregnantit’s estimated that a third of people over 50 have a hiatus hernia.there’s also a rare type of hiatus hernia that affects newborn babies, which is caused by a congenital defect of the stomach or diaphragm. congenital means that it is present from birth.there are 2 main types of hiatus hernia. they are: sliding hiatus hernias – hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatus hernias are of this type) para-oesophageal hiatus hernias – also called rolling hiatus hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus (about 5 to 15% of hiatus hernias are of this type)these pages mainly focus on sliding hiatus hernias. they can usually be diagnosed using anx-rayor an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body.read more aboutdiagnosing a hiatus hernia.treatment for a sliding hiatus hernia usually focuses on relieving the symptoms of gord, such as heartburn.lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments. surgery is usually only recommended as an alternative to long-term medication or if other treatments haven’t worked.lifestyle advice may include: eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than 3 large meals a day avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for 3 hours after eating or drinking removing any foods or drinks from your diet that make your symptoms worseif a hiatus hernia isn’t causing any noticeable problems, it doesn’t usually need to be treated.surgery is used to repair a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia if there’s a risk of serious complications.read more abouttreating a hiatus hernia.it’s rare for a hiatus hernia to cause complications, but long-term damage to the oesophagus caused by leaking stomach acid can lead to ulcers, scarring and changes to the cells of the oesophagus, which can increase your risk ofoesophageal cancer.read more about thecomplications of a hiatus hernia.a hiatus hernia can usually be diagnosed after a gastroscopy or x-ray.a gastroscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a gastroscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end), which sends images to an external monitor.the gastroscope will be inserted into your mouth and down your throat, and will be used to help identify any problems. the procedure may be carried out using alocal anaestheticor a sedative to help you relax.the barium mealx-ray, also called the barium swallow test, is an effective way of identifying a hiatus hernia.as part of the test, you’ll be asked to drink some barium solution. barium is a non-toxic chemical that shows up clearly on an x-ray. once the barium moves down into your digestive system, a series of x-rays will be taken to identify any problems.if you need to have a barium meal x-ray, you won’t be able to eat or drink anything for at least 6 hours before the procedure, so that your stomach and duodenum (the top of the small intestine) are empty. you may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system.you’ll be given a white, chalky liquid containing barium to drink while lying down. this will allow the specialist to see your stomach on an x-ray monitor more easily, as well as any ulcers or abnormal growths. your bed may be tipped slightly during the test, so that the barium fills all the areas of your stomach.a barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes to perform. afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system.you may feel slightly sick after a barium meal x-ray and the barium may causeconstipation. your stools may also be white for a few days afterwards, as the barium passes through your system.treatment for a hiatus hernia is usually only necessary if it’s causing problems.in most cases, people with a hiatus hernia only experience problems if the hernia causesgastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord). gord can cause symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in your mouth.lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments, although surgery may be used as an alternative to long-term medication, or if other treatments are ineffective.there are several things you can do yourself to help relievesymptoms of gordcaused by a hiatus hernia. these include: eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than three large meals a day avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for at least 3 hours after eating or drinking avoiding drinking during the night removing certain foods from your diet if you think they make your symptoms worse avoidingalcohol, caffeine, chocolate, tomatoes, fatty foods, spicy foods and acidic food or drinks, such as citrus fruit juice, if they make your symptoms worse avoiding bending over or stooping, particularly after eating or drinking raising the head of your bed by around 20cm (8 inches) by placing a piece of wood or blocks under it; don’t use extra pillows, because this may increase pressure on your abdomenif you’re overweight,losing weightmay help to reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms.if you smoke, you should try to give up. tobacco smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worse.read aboutstopping smoking.a number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of hiatus hernia. these are described below.antacid medicines can relieve some of the symptoms of hiatus hernia. they come in liquid or tablet form and can be swallowed or chewed. they help to neutralise stomach acid when they reach the oesophagus and stomach by making it less acidic.however, antacid medicines don’t work for everyone. they’re not a long-term solution if symptoms persist or you’re in extreme discomfort.antacids shouldn’t be taken at the same time as other medicines, because they can stop other medicines from being properly absorbed by your body. they may also damage the special coating on some types of tablets. ask your gp or pharmacist for advice.alginates are an alternative medicine to antacids. they work by producing a protective coating that shields the lining of your stomach and oesophagus from the effects of stomach acid.in some cases, a medicine known as an h2-receptor antagonist (h2ra) may be recommended if a hiatus hernia is causing gord. examples of h2ras include cimetidine, famotidine (pepcidtwo) and ranitidine.h2ras block the effects of the chemical histamine, which your body uses to produce stomach acid. h2ras therefore help to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach.side effects of h2ras are uncommon. however, possible side effects may includediarrhoea,headaches, tiredness and a rash.some h2ras are available over the counter at pharmacies. these types of hr2as are taken in a lower dosage than the ones available on prescription. ask your gp or pharmacist if you’re not sure whether these medicines are suitable for you.your gp may prescribe a medication called a proton-pump inhibitor (ppi). ppis work by reducing the amount of acid produced by your stomach. examples of the ppis you may be prescribed include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole.most people tolerate ppis well and side effects are uncommon. when they do occur, they’re usually mild and can include headaches, diarrhoea, feeling sick orconstipation.to minimise any side effects, your gp will prescribe the lowest possible dose of ppis they think will be effective. you should let your gp know if the prescribed dose of ppis doesn’t work. a stronger dose may be needed.surgery is usually only recommended for a sliding hiatus hernia (hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area) if the problem fails to respond to lifestyle changes and medication.you may also want to consider surgery if you have persistent and troublesome symptoms, but don’t want to take medication on a long-term basis.prior to surgery, you may need further investigations to check how well the oesophagus moves (manometry) and how much acid is being refluxed (24-hour oesopageal ph studies).a procedure called a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (lnf) is one of the most common surgical techniques used to treat gord and sliding hiatus hernias.lnf is a type of keyhole surgery that involves making a series of small cuts in your abdomen. carbon dioxide gas is used to inflate your abdomen to give the surgeon room to work in.during lnf, the stomach is put back into the correct position and the diaphragm around the lower part of the oesophagus is tightened. this should prevent any acid moving back out of your stomach.lnf is carried out undergeneral anaesthetic, so you won’t feel any pain or discomfort. the surgery takes 60 to 90 minutes to complete.after having lnf, you should be able to leave hospital after you’ve recovered from the effects of the general anaesthetic. this is usually within 2 to 3 days. depending on the type of job you do, you should be able to return to work within 3 to 6 weeks.for the first 6 weeks after surgery, it’s recommended that you only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. avoid eating hard food that could get stuck at the site of the surgery, such as toast, chicken or steak.common side effects of lnf include difficulties swallowing (dysphagia), belching, bloating andflatulence.these side effects should resolve over the course of a few months. however, in about 1 in 100 cases they can be persistent. in such circumstances, further corrective surgery may be required.if you have a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia, where the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus, surgery may be recommended to reduce the risk of the hernia becoming strangulated (seecomplications of a hiatus herniafor more information).complications from a hiatus hernia are rare, but they can be serious.hiatus hernias that slide in and out of the chest area (sliding hiatus hernias) can causegastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord). this is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (gullet). this can damage the oesophagus, increasing the risk of problems.damage to the lining of the oesophagus (oesophagitis) caused by stomach acid can lead to the formation of ulcers. the ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making swallowing difficult.ulcers can usually be successfully treated by controlling the underlyingsymptoms of gord. in most cases, over-the-counter medicines called antacids or alginates are used to treat the condition.read more abouttreating gord.repeated damage to the lining of your oesophagus can lead to the formation of scar tissue. if the scar tissue is allowed to build up, it can cause your oesophagus to become narrowed. this is known as oesophageal stricture.an oesophageal stricture can make swallowing food difficult and painful. oesophageal strictures can be treated using a tiny balloon to dilate (widen) the oesophagus. this procedure is usually carried out under alocal anaesthetic.repeated damage to the oesophagus can also lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. this is a condition known as barrett’s oesophagus.barrett’s oesophagus doesn’t usually cause noticeable symptoms, other than those associated with gord. however, barrett’s oesophagus can increase your risk of developingoesophageal cancer.if you have persistent reflux symptoms for more than 3 weeks, you should talk to your gp because you may need some investigations.in some cases, a hiatus hernia causes part of the stomach to push up next to the oesophagus. this is known as a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia. gord doesn’t usually occur in these cases, but there’s a risk of the hernia becoming strangulated.strangulation occurs when the hernia becomes knotted and the blood

       " 'High cholesterol': 'cholesterol is a fatty substance known as a lipid. it’s vital for the normal functioning of the body. cell membranes, hormones and vitamin d are created by your body using cholesterol.there are 2 main sources of the cholesterol in your blood: cholesterol in the food you eat cholesterol produced by your liverhaving an excessively high level of lipids in your blood (hyperlipidemia) can have an effect on your health.high cholesterol, on its own, doesn’t usually cause any symptoms but increases your risk of serious health conditions.cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. when the two combine, they’re called lipoproteins. there are two main types of lipoprotein.high-density lipoprotein (hdl) carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver. from there it’s either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product. for this reason, hdl is referred to as “good cholesterol” and higher levels are better.low-density lipoprotein (ldl) carries cholesterol to the cells that need it. if there’s too much cholesterol for the cells to use it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries. for this reason, ldl is known as “bad cholesterol”.the amount of cholesterol in the blood, both hdl and ldl , is measured with ablood test.the recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease.evidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of: narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) heart attack stroke transient ischaemic attack (tia) – often known as a “mini stroke” peripheral arterial disease (pad)this is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. it also increases the risk of a blood clot developing somewhere in your body.your risk of developingcoronary heart diseasealso rises as your blood’s cholesterol level increases. this can cause pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity (angina).many factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol.these include: an unhealthy diet – in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat smoking– a chemical called acrolin, found in cigarettes, stops hdl transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) havingdiabetesorhigh blood pressure(hypertension) having a family history of stroke or heart diseasethere’s also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia. this can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily.read more about the causes of high cholesterolyour gp may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you: have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (tia), or peripheral arterial disease (pad) have a family history of early cardiovascular disease have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition are overweight have high blood pressure, diabetes or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levelsread more about how cholesterol is testedblood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol/l.as a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be: 5mmol/l or less for healthy adults 4mmol/l or less for those at high riskas a general guide, ldl levels should be: 3mmol/l or less for healthy adults 2mmol/l or less for those at high riskan ideal level of hdl is above 1mmol/l. a lower level of hdl can increase your risk of heart disease.your ratio of total cholesterol to hdl may also be calculated. this is your total cholesterol level divided by your hdl level. generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease.cholesterol is only one risk factor. the level at which specific treatment is required will depend on whether other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, are also present.the first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintaina healthy, balanced diet. it’s important to keep your diet low in fatty food.you can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. this will alsohelp prevent high cholesterol from returning.other lifestyle changes, such as takingregular exerciseandgiving up smoking, can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol.if these measures don’t reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your gp may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such asstatins.your gp will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins. the benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks.read more about how high cholesterol is treatedmany different factors can contribute to high blood cholesterol, including lifestyle factors like smoking, an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, as well as having an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.your lifestyle can increase your risk of developing high blood cholesterol.this includes: an unhealthy diet – some foods, such as liver, kidneys and eggs, contain cholesterol (dietary cholesterol), but this has little effect on blood cholesterol: it’s the total amount of saturated fat in your diet that’s more important to watch; read more aboutpreventing high cholesterol lack of exercise or physical activity – this can increase your level of “bad cholesterol” (low-density lipoprotein, or ldl) obesity– if you’re overweight, it’s likely that you’ll have higher levels of ldl cholesterol and triglycerides, and a lower level of high-density lipoprotein (hdl) drinking excessive amounts of alcohol– regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol can increase your cholesterol and triglyceride levels smoking– a chemical in cigarettes called acrolein stops “good cholesterol” (hdl) transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)people withhigh blood pressure (hypertension)anddiabetesoften have high cholesterol.some other health conditions that can also cause raised levels of cholesterol include: kidney disease liver disease anunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)treating the underlying condition can help to reduce cholesterol.there are a number of factors associated with high cholesterol that can’t be changed that increase your risk of having aheart attackorstroke. doctors refer to these as “fixed factors”.they include: family history of earlycoronary heart disease (chd)or stroke – you’re more likely to have high cholesterol if you have a close male relative (father or brother) aged under 55, or a female relative (mother or sister) aged under 65, who’s had chd or stroke a family history of a cholesterol-related condition – for example, having a parent, brother or sister with familial hypercholesterolaemia age – the older you are, the greater the likelihood of your arteries narrowing (atherosclerosis) ethnic group – people of indian, pakistani, bangladeshi and sri lankan descent are at increased risk of having a heart attack sex – males are more likely to have heart attacks than femalesif you have a fixed risk factor, or several fixed risk factors, it’s even more important to look at your lifestyle and any underlying conditions you may have.familial hypercholesterolaemia is the medical term for high cholesterol that runs in families. it’s caused by a gene alteration inherited from a parent, rather than an unhealthy lifestyle.people with familial hypercholesterolaemia have raised cholesterol from birth, which can lead to the early development of heart problems, such as atherosclerosis and chd.in the uk, familial hypercholesterolaemia is thought to affect about 1 in 500 people, which means approximately 120,000 people are thought to be affected.there’s a one in two (50%) chance that a child or brother or sister of someone with familial hypercholesterolaemia will also have the condition.read more about the importance ofearly identification and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemiablood cholesterol levels are measured with a simple blood test.a blood sample is taken that will be used to determine the amount of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or ldl), good cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or hdl) and other fatty substances (triglycerides) in your blood.you may be asked not to eat for 10-12 hours before the cholesterol test, usually including when you’re asleep at night. this ensures that all food is completely digested and won’t affect the outcome of the test.your gp or practice nurse can carry out the cholesterol test and will take a blood sample, either using a needle and a syringe or by pricking your finger.a newer type of test that measures non-high-density lipoprotein (non-hdl) is now sometimes used because it’s thought to be a more accurate way of estimatingcardiovascular disease (cvd)risk than ldl.non-hdl cholesterol is total cholesterol minus hdl cholesterol. it’s also not necessary to fast before the test, so it is more convenient.your gp may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you: have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease,strokeormini-stroke (tia), or peripheral arterial disease (pad) are over the age of 40 – people over 40 should have their estimate of cvd risk reviewed regularly

diabetes have another medical condition, such askidney disease, anunderactive thyroid, or aninflamed pancreas (pancreatitis)– these conditions can cause increased levels of cholesterol or triglyceridesafter your cholesterol test, your gp or nurse will explain your results and calculate whether you have a high, moderate or low risk of developing heart disease or stroke (cardiovascular disease) within the next 10 years.however, this risk isn’t just based on your cholesterol reading. it also takes into account: your bmi (body mass index) – which measures your weight in relation to your height treatable risk factors – such ashigh blood pressure (hypertension),diabetesand other medical conditions your age, sex, family history and ethnicitybased on your results, your gp or nurse will recommend steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing cvd.this may include advice about making lifestyle changes, such as eating more healthily – by increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, for example – and doing more exercise.cholesterol-lowering medication, such asstatins, may also be recommended.read more abouttreating high cholesterolpeople with familial hypercholesterolaemia, or inherited high cholesterol, are at increased risk of developing cvd.in the uk, most of the 120,000 people thought to have the condition are undiagnosed and untreated.as a result of the increased risk of developing cvd, it’s very important that those with familial hypercholesterolaemia are diagnosed as early as possible and offered appropriate treatment.thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)recommends that adults with a total cholesterol level of above 7.5mmol/l before treatment should be assessed for familial hypercholesterolaemia.if you’ve been diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolaemia, you’ll be referred for a specialist assessment, which may include dna testing to confirm the diagnosis.appropriate treatment will be recommended and other members of your family who may be affected will also be tested.you’ll be closely monitored, and should have a full review at least once a year to check how well your treatment is working and assess any symptoms you may have.children at risk of familial hypercholesterolaemia will be tested by the time they reach 10 years of age.this is because any signs of cvd, such as thickening of the carotid artery wall, will be identifiable by this age.the assessment will be carried out by a specialist with expertise in familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and young people.early diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia means it’s possible to recommend lifestyle changes and other appropriate treatments to reduce the long-term problems associated with high cholesterol and improve long-term health.for further information, see thenice guidance about familial hypercholesterolaemiaif you’ve been diagnosed with high cholesterol, you’ll be advised to make changes to your diet and increase your level of exercise.after a few months, if your cholesterol level hasn’t dropped, you may be advised to take cholesterol-lowering medication.changing your diet,stopping smokingand exercising more will also help to prevent high cholesterol developing.the various treatments for high cholesterol are outlined below.eating ahealthy, balanced dietthat’s low in saturated fats can reduce your level of “bad cholesterol” (ldl).try to avoid or cut down on the following foods, which are high in saturated fat: fatty cuts of meat and meat products, such as sausages and pies butter, ghee and lard cream, soured cream, crème fraîche and ice cream cheese, particularly hard cheese cakes and biscuits milk chocolate coconut oil, coconut cream and palm oilthe government recommends that a maximum of 11% of a person’s food energy should come from saturated fat. this equates to no more than: 30g of saturated fat a day for the average man 20g of saturated fat a day for the average womanchildren should have less.check the labels on the foods you’re eating to find out how much saturated fat you’re consuming.many experts believe that the fats found in avocados and oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon and tuna, are good for you.these are known as omega-3 fatty acids and high doses can improve (lower) triglyceride levels in some people. however, too much omega-3 fatty acids can contribute toobesity.for people with a high triglyceride level, at least two portions of oily fish a week is thought to be beneficial. however, there’s no evidence that taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements has the same benefit.there are several different types of cholesterol-lowering medication that work in different ways. your gp can advise you about the most suitable type of treatment, and may also prescribemedication to lower high blood pressure (hypertension)if it affects you.the most commonly prescribed medications are outlined below.statinsblock the enzyme (a type of chemical) in your liver that helps to make cholesterol. this leads to a reduction in your blood cholesterol level.you’ll usually be started on a medication called atorvastatin. other statins include simvastatin and rosuvastatin.when someone has side effects from using a statin, it’s described as having an “intolerance” to it.side effects of statinsincludeheadaches, muscle pain and stomach problems, such asindigestion, diarrhoea orconstipation.statins will only be prescribed to people who continue to be at high risk of heart disease, because they need to be taken for life. cholesterol levels start to rise again once you stop taking them.in some cases, a low daily dose ofaspirinmay be prescribed, depending on your age (usually over 40 years old) and other risk factors.low-dose aspirin can help to preventblood clotsforming, particularly for someone who’s had aheart attack, has established vascular disease, or a high risk of developingcardiovascular disease (cvd).you may also be advised to have periodicblood teststo ensure your liver is functioning well.ezetimibe is a medication that blocks the absorption of cholesterol from food and bile juices in your intestines into your blood. it’s generally not as effective as statins, but is less likely to cause side effects.you can take ezetimibe at the same time as your usual statin if your cholesterol levels aren’t low enough with the statin alone. the side effects of this combination are generally the same as those of the statin on its own (muscle pain and stomach problems).you can take ezetimibe by itself if you’re unable to take a statin. this may be because you have another medical condition, you take medication that interferes with how the statin works, or because you experience side effects from statins. ezetimibe taken on its own rarely causes side effects.for more information, you can read the national institute for health & care excellence (nice) guidelines about the use ofezetimibe for treating high cholesterol.you can lower your cholesterol by eating a healthy, balanced diet that’s low in saturated fat, exercising regularly, not smoking and cutting down on alcohol.if you have an unhealthy diet that’s high in fat, fatty plaques are much more likely to build up in your arteries. this is because fatty foods contain cholesterol.there are two types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. you should avoid foods containing saturated fats, as they will increase the levels of “bad cholesterol” (low-density lipoprotein, or ldl) in your blood.foods high in saturated fat include: meat pies sausages and fatty cuts of meat butter ghee – a type of butter often used in indian cooking lard cream hard cheese cakes and biscuits food that contains coconut or palm oilhowever, it’s not healthy to completely cut out all types of fat from your diet. it’s important to replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats – they’ve been shown to increase levels of “good cholesterol” (high-density lipoprotein, or hdl) and reduce any blockage in your arteries.foods that are high in unsaturated fat include: oily fish – such as mackerel, salmon and tuna avocados nuts and seeds sunflower, rapeseed and olive oila low-fat diet including lots of fibre, such as wholegrain rice, bread and pasta, and plenty of fruit and vegetables has also been shown to help lower cholesterol.fruit and vegetables are full of vitamins, minerals and fibre, and help keep your body in good condition. aim to eatfive 80g portions of fruit and vegetables every day.a chemical found in cigarettes called acrolein stops hdl transporting fatty deposits to the liver, leading to high cholesterol and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). this means smoking is a major risk factor for both heart attacks andstrokes.if you decide to stop smoking, your gp can refer you to an nhs stop smoking service, which will provide you with dedicated help and advice about the best ways to give up smoking.you can also callquit your way scotlandon 0800 84 84 84. the specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement.if you’re committed to giving up smoking but don’t want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your gp should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may experience after giving up.read more abouttreatment for quitting smokingbeing active andexercising regularlywill increase the levels of hdl in your body by stimulating the body to move fatty deposits to the liver, so they can be broken down.exercise will also help you maintain a healthy weight, and lose weight if you’re overweight. being overweight can increase the amount of “bad cholesterol” in your blood.another benefit of regular physical activity is it will help lower your blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.doing 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week is recommended to help lower your cholesterol.walking,swimmingandcyclingare good examples of this type of exercise.read more about the recommendedphysical activity guidelines for adults (aged 19-64)and thephysical activity guidelines for older adults (aged 65 and over) statins

       " 'HIV': 'hiv is a long-term health condition that is now very easy to manage.hiv stands for human immunodeficiency virus. the virus targets the immune system and if untreated, weakens your ability to fight infections and disease.speak to a sexual health service as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to hiv.most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after infection, which lasts for 2 weeks. this is known as primary hiv infection.symptoms of primary hiv infection include:other symptoms can include: tiredness joint pain muscle pain swollen glandsafter these symptoms disappear, hiv may not cause symptoms for many years. during this time, hiv continues to be active and causes damage to your immune system.this means many people who have hiv do not know they’re infected.once the immune system becomes severely damaged symptoms can include: weight loss chronic diarrhoea night sweats skin problems recurrent infections serious life-threatening illnessesif you think you might have hiv, get tested for free by: booking an appointment at your local sexual health service contacting your gp practice for an appointment ordering a home test kit contacting clinics run by charities such as theterrence higgins trustorwaverley care scotlandfor an appointment contacting local drug dependency services for an appointmentservices available may vary depending on where you live.some private clinics may offer hiv testing, but they may charge.anyone who thinks they may have hiv should get tested.certain groups of people are at a higher risk and are advised to have regular tests. for example: gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men should have an hiv test at least once a year, or every 3 months if having sex withouthiv prepor condoms with new or casual partners women and men from countries with high hiv prevalence, especially from sub-saharan africa, should have an hiv test if having sex without using hiv prep or condoms with new or casual partners people who inject drugs or have unprotected sex (sex without condoms orhiv prep) with people who inject drugsthe test for hiv is straightforward, highly accurate and is the only way to know if you’re infected. it involves taking a sample from the body for analysis.there are 4 main types of hiv test.where a sample of blood is taken and sent to a lab for analysis. results are usually available within a few days.a sample of saliva from your mouth or a small spot of blood from your finger is taken. this sample doesn’t need to be sent to a lab and the result is available within a few minutes. anyone who has a reactive point of care test still needs a confirmed laboratory test.where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood at home and send it off in the post for analysis. you’ll be contacted by phone or text with your result in a few days. you can buy them online or from some pharmacies. anyone who has a reactive home testing kit result is still required to have a laboratory confirmed test.where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood yourself and test it at home. the result is available within minutes. check that any test you buy has a ce quality assurance mark and is licensed for sale in the uk.antiretroviral medicines are used to treat hiv. they work by stopping the virus multiplying in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and prevent further damage.these come in tablet form and must be taken every day.most people with hiv take a combination of medicines.the goal of hiv treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. this means the level of hiv virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.people who take hiv treatment and whose virus level is undetectable can’t pass hiv on to others. although there is no cure for hiv yet, people living with hiv who take their treatment should have a normal lifespan and good health.without treatment, people with hiv will eventually become unwell. hiv can be fatal if it’s not detected and treated in time to allow the immune system to repair. it’s extremely important to test for hiv if you think you’ve been exposed.you can get hiv by having unprotected vaginal or anal sex (sex without acondomor not takinghiv prep). it may be possible for hiv to be passed on through unprotected oral sex, but the risk is very low.other ways of getting hiv include: sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used sharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment from mother to baby before or during birth when the mother isn’t taking hiv medication from mother to baby by breastfeeding when the mother isn’t taking hiv medication blood transfusion (outside of the uk)people who are at higher risk of becoming infected with hiv include people who are not taking hiv prep medication and who are: men who have had unprotected anal sex with men women who have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men people who have had unprotected sex with a person who has lived or travelled in a high hiv prevalence country people who inject drugs people who have had unprotected sex with somebody who has injected drugs people who have caught another sexually transmitted infection (sti)the best way to reduce your risk of stis is to practicesafer sex. this means using acondomfor vaginal, anal and oral sex. if you’re having anal sex it’s important to also use water-based or silicon-based lubricant.takinghiv prepbefore you’re exposed to hiv means there’s a drug inside of you to block hiv if it gets into your body, so it can’t infect you.if you think you may have recently been exposed to hiv and you haven’t taken hiv prep medication or used a condom, you should take pep medication.pep is a form of emergency hiv medication taken by someone who does not have hiv but who has or may have been very recently exposed to hiv.pep should be taken as soon as possible, but it can be taken up to 72 hours after exposure. the earlier it is taken the more effective it is.pep is available fromsexual health servicesor out of hours froma&e.if you inject drugs, you should never share needles or other injecting equipment (including syringes, spoons and swabs).you can get free clean needles and other injecting equipment from your local injecting equipment providers, which are sometimes also calledneedle exchanges.if you’ve been diagnosed with hiv you should get tested for all stis and blood borne viruses including: chlamydia gonorrhoea syphilis hepatitis b hepatitis c hiv

       " 'Hodgkin lymphoma': 'hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.the lymphatic system is part of your immune system. clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes.in hodgkin lymphoma, b-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). the affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.the most common symptom of hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.read more about thesymptoms of hodgkin lymphoma.hodgkin lymphoma can develop at any age, but it mostly affects young adults in their early 20s and older adults over the age of 70. slightly more men than women are affected.the exact cause of hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. however, your risk of developing the condition is increased if: you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system you take immunosuppressant medication you’ve previously been exposed to a common virus called the epstein-barr virus – which causesglandular feveryou also have an increased risk of developing hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition.read more about thecauses of hodgkin lymphoma.the only way to confirm a diagnosis of hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out abiopsy.this is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.read more aboutdiagnosing hodgkin lymphoma.hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. despite this, it’s also one of the most easily treated types of cancer.your recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, because many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. how far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.the main treatments used arechemotherapy, followed byradiotherapyor chemotherapy alone. surgery isn’t generally used as a treatment for the condition.read more about: treatment for hodgkin lymphoma complications of hodgkin lymphomathe most common symptom of hodgkin lymphoma is a swelling in the neck, armpit or groin. the swelling is usually painless, although some people find that it aches.the swelling is caused by an excess of affected lymphocytes (white blood cells) collecting in a lymph node (also called lymph glands). lymph nodes are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. they contain white blood cells that help to fight infection.however, it’s highly unlikely that you have hodgkin lymphoma if you haveswollen lymph nodes, as these glands often swell as a response to infection.some people with hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. these can include: night sweats unintentional weight loss a high temperature (fever) a persistentcoughor feeling ofbreathlessness persistent itching of the skin all over the bodyother symptoms will depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. for example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may haveabdominal painorindigestiona few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they’re diagnosed. this may lead to: persistent tiredness or fatigue an increased risk of infections excessive bleeding – such asnosebleeds, heavy periods and spots of blood under the skinin some cases, people with hodgkin lymphoma experience pain in their lymph glands when they drink alcohol.speak to your gp if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.while the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by hodgkin lymphoma, it is best to get them checked out.hodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the dna of a type of white blood cell called b lymphocytes, although the exact reason why this happens isn’t known.the dna gives the cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. the mutation in the dna changes these instructions so the cells keep growing, causing them to multiply uncontrollably.the abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. over time, it’s possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your: bone marrow spleen liver skin lungswhile the cause of the initial mutation that triggers hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. these include: having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such ashiv having medical treatment that weakens your immune system – for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after an organ transplant being previously exposed to the epstein-barr virus (ebv) – a common virus that causesglandular fever having previously hadnon-hodgkin lymphoma, possibly because of treatment withchemotherapyorradiotherapy being very overweight (obese) – this may be more of a risk factor in women than menhodgkin lymphoma isn’t infectious and isn’t thought to run in families. although your risk is increased if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had lymphoma, it’s not clear if this is because of an inherited genetic fault or lifestyle factors.hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, although most cases are diagnosed in people in their early 20s or 70s. the condition is slightly more common in men than women.if you speak to your gp because you’re concerned about symptoms of hodgkin lymphoma, they’ll ask about your health and carry out a simple physical examination.if necessary, your gp will refer you to hospital for further tests.in 2015, thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of hodgkin lymphoma and refer people for the right tests faster.to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected hodgkin lymphoma, read thenice 2015 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral.if you’re referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of hodgkin lymphoma.abiopsyinvolves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory.biopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under alocal anaesthetic(where the area is numbed). in some cases, the affected lymph node isn’t easily accessible and ageneral anaestheticmay be required (where you’re asleep).a pathologist (an expert in the study of diseased tissue) will then check the tissue sample for the presence of cancerous cells. if they find cancerous cells, they can also identify exactly which type of hodgkin lymphoma you have, which is an important factor in planning your treatment.if a biopsy confirms a diagnosis of hodgkin lymphoma, further testing will be needed to check how far the lymphoma has spread. this allows a doctor to diagnose the stage of your lymphoma.further tests may include: blood tests– samples of blood will be taken throughout your diagnosis and treatment to check your general health, the levels of red and white cells and platelets in your blood, and how well organs such as your liver and kidneys are working bone marrow sample – another biopsy may be carried out to see if the cancer has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic chestx-ray– this can check whether the cancer has spread to your chest or lungs computerised tomography (ct) scan– this scan takes a series of x-rays that build up a 3d picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of the cancer magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– this scan uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body, to check the spread of the cancer positron emission tomography (pet) scan– this scan measures the activity of cells in different parts of the body and can check the spread of the cancer and the impact of treatment; it’s usually taken at the same time as a ct scan to show precisely how the tissues of different sites of the body are workingwhen testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. staging means scoring the cancer by how far it’s spread.the main stages of hodgkin lymphoma are: stage 1 – the cancer is limited to one group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs) stage 2 – 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below the diaphragm stage 3 – the cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm stage 4 – the cancer has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrowhealth professionals also add the letters a or b to your stage, to indicate whether or not you have certain symptoms.a is put after your stage if you have no additional symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes. b is put after your stage if you have additional symptoms of weight loss, fever or night sweats.hodgkin lymphoma can usually be treated successfully with chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.your specific treatment plan will depend on your general health and your age, as many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. how far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.discussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. this is known as a multidisciplinary team (mdt).your mdt will recommend the best treatment options for you. however, you shouldn’t be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner.the main treatments for hodgkin lymphoma are chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. in a few cases, chemotherapy may be combined with steroid medication.surgery isn’t generally used to treat the condition, except for thebiopsyused to diagnose it.overall, treatment for hodgkin lymphoma is highly effective and most people with the condition are eventually cured.chemotherapyis a type of cancer treatment where medicine is used to kill cancer cells. this medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on the stage of your cancer.if doctors think your cancer is curable, you’ll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy). if a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms.chemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight. however, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome and a longer hospital stay may be needed.chemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. this can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems: fatigue breathlessness increased vulnerability to infection bleeding and bruising more easilyif you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells.other possible side effects of chemotherapy include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes hair loss infertility, which may be temporary or permanentmost side effects should pass once your treatment has finished. tell your care team if the side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments that can help.read more about theside effects of chemotherapy.if regular chemotherapy is unsuccessful or hodgkin lymphoma returns after treatment, you may have a course of chemotherapy at a higher dose.however, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. you’ll need a stem cell or bone marrow transplant to replace the damaged bone marrow.radiotherapyis most often used to treat early-stage hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in one part of the body.treatment is normally given in short daily sessions, monday to friday, over several weeks. you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital between appointments.radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. these can vary and will be directly related to the part of your body being treated. for example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss.other common side effects include: tiredness nausea and vomiting dry mouth loss of appetitemost side effects are temporary, but there’s a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area.read more about: side effects of radiotherapy complications of hodgkin lymphomasteroid medicationis sometimes used in combination with chemotherapy as a more intensive treatment for advanced cases of hodgkin lymphoma, or if initial treatment hasn’t worked.the steroid medication is given intravenously, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy.common side effects of steroid medication include: increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain indigestion problems sleeping feeling agitatedthe side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes.if you’re diagnosed with a rare type of hodgkin lymphoma called lymphocyte-predominant hodgkin lymphoma, you may have chemotherapy in combination with a medication called rituximab.rituximab is a type of biological therapy called a monoclonal antibody. it attaches itself to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulates the immune system to attack and kill the cell.it’s given through a drip directly into a vein over the course of a few hours.side effects of the drug can include: flu-like symptoms, such asheadaches, fever and muscle pain tiredness nausea diarrhoeayou may be given additional medication to prevent or reduce side effects. any side effects should improve over time as your body gets used to the medication.after your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.these appointments start off being every few weeks or months, but will become gradually less frequent over time.read further information: cancer research uk: treating hodgkin

infection include: a high temperature (fever) headache aching muscles diarrhoea tirednessyou should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up-to-date.however, it’s important to speak to your gp or care team about this, as it may not be safe for you to have ‘live’ vaccines (vaccines containing a weakened form of the virus or organism being vaccinated against) until several months after your treatment finishes.examples of live vaccines include the: shingles vaccine bcg vaccine (against tuberculosis) mmr vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella)chemotherapyandradiotherapyfor hodgkin

options.in some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment, so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.people who have had hodgkin lymphoma are more likely to get lymphoma,leukaemiaor other cancers in the future. chemotherapy and radiotherapy further increase this risk.second cancers, such asbreast cancerorlung cancer, usually develop more than 10 years after you’re treated for hodgkin lymphoma. in rare cases, other types of cancer, such as leukaemia or other lymphomas, develop after only a few years.you can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.you should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your gp at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you’re invited to.the risk of developing other health conditions in the future, such ascardiovascular diseaseand lung disease, is also higher in people who have had hodgkin lymphoma.you should report unexpected symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, to your gp for

       " 'Hodgkin lymphoma: Children': 'hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. it can affect children at any age but is more common in older teenagers and young adults.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that occurs in the lymphatic system. there are 2 main types of hodgkin lymphoma: classical hodgkin lymphoma, which affects 95% of patients, and lymphocyte predominant hodgkin lymphoma (lphl), which only affects 5% of patients. this information is about classical hodgkin lymphoma, but it includes a short section about lphl.the lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body’s natural defence against infection and disease.the lymphatic system is made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (or lymph glands). lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels that contain lymph fluid. lymphomas can start anywhere in the lymphatic system, but hodgkin lymphoma is most likely to start in the lymph nodes in the neck. the other areas where lymph nodes are likely to swell are above the collar bone, the armpit, the groin and inside the chest. glands can swell in these areas as part of the body’s response to infection, not just cancer, which is why a biopsy is needed to diagnose lymphoma.the number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. in some parts of the body, there are very few lymph nodes, whereas under your arm there may be 20 to 50.there are 2 main types of lymphoma:non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl)and hodgkin lymphoma (hl). although these are both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment.the exact cause of hodgkin lymphoma is not known. in most people that develop hodgkin lymphoma, no cause is found. however, there is increasing evidence that infections, such as the virus that causes glandular fever, may play a part in the development of hodgkin lymphoma, especially in childhood. poor immunity may also be a risk factor for developing the disease. very rarely, more than one member of a family may develop hodgkin lymphoma but it is not inherited from parents and you cannot catch it from another person.the first sign of hodgkin lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of 1 gland, or a group of lymph glands, which continues for some weeks or even months. the first glands that are likely to be affected are in the neck or above the collarbone, most often only on 1 side. however, it’s important to remember that children’s glands can also become swollen when they have a common infection that causes a sore throat or a cold. if glands in the chest are affected, this can cause a cough or breathlessness. this is caused by the pressure the glands exert on the airways.sometimes, a child with hodgkin lymphoma may have a high temperature (fever), night sweats, weight loss or itchy skin.as lymph glands can swell for lots of reasons, a biopsy is carried out to diagnose hodgkin lymphoma. a biopsy is when a swollen lymph gland is removed and the cells are looked at under a microscope. it’s a small operation which is usually done under a general anaesthetic. sometimes only a small part of the lymph gland has to be removed, which can be done under a local anaesthetic.if hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed after the biopsy, further tests are carried out to find out the exact size and position of the lymphoma, and to see whether it has spread beyond the original area. these tests include x-rays, blood tests, ct, mri and pet scans.very often, a bone marrow sample will be taken. this is because the lymphoma cells can spread to the bone marrow as well as to other lymph glands.the tests that are carried out are called staging tests. any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) has more information about what the tests and scans involve.the stage of hodgkin lymphoma describes the size and position of the cancer and whether it has spread. staging is very important because the type of treatment your child receives will depend on the stage of the disease. the staging system for hodgkin lymphoma is as follows:as well as giving each stage a number, doctors also use a letter code – either a, b, or e: a means your child has no symptoms b means your child has 1 or more of the following symptoms: a fever, night sweats or significant weight loss e means that the lymphoma has grown from the lymph gland to extranodal tissue (tissue in places outside the lymph nodes)a number and letter is used in the staging of every child with hodgkin lymphoma. this helps the doctor decide on a treatment plan for your child.children with hodgkin lymphoma are usually treated with chemotherapy, but sometimes radiotherapy is also needed. the type and amount of treatment given depend on the stage of the disease when it is diagnosed. your child’s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you.this is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.it is usual for a combination of drugs to be used, which will often be given every few weeks over a number of months. a combination of drugs is used because each chemotherapy drug works in a different way. using several drugs together increases the effectiveness of the treatment. it also means lower doses of individual drugs can be used, which may reduce the possibility of long-term side effects.this is used in less than half of people with hodgkin lymphoma. it treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.treatment for hodgkin lymphoma can cause side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. any possible side effects will depend on the particular treatment being used and the part of the body that is being treated.some general side effects of chemotherapy that can occur during treatment include: feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss low blood count which can lead to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding tirednesschanges to your child’s sense of taste and changes in their bowel may also happen. if your child has side effects from the treatment it is important to discuss them with your doctor or nurse. they may be able to help reduce them.the cure rate for hodgkin lymphoma is very high, which means some children may develop side effects many years after treatment. the chance of developing late side effects depends on where the original tumour was, how far it spread, and the type of treatment your child had.these late side effects can affect the normal organs such as the heart, kidneys and lungs. following treatment for hodgkin lymphoma, there is a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. there is also a chance that fertility may be affected. teenage boys who are diagnosed after puberty should have the option of sperm banking before treatment starts. in this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years.your child’s doctor or nurse will explain more about any possible late side effects.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version.the aim of treatment for hodgkin lymphoma is to cure the cancer with the fewest possible short and long-term side effects. this is particularly important in childhood hodgkin lymphoma where cure rates are high. it’s important to get the balance right between curing the cancer and having the lowest risk of long-term side effects.if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you may have. written information is often provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.about 90% of children who develop hodgkin lymphoma are cured. when your child completes treatment, they will then go into a follow-up phase, seeing doctors and nurses in out-patient clinics usually for around five years. clinic visits will be every 3 to 4 months to start with and there will be occasional scans, x-rays, and blood tests done for several years after completing treatment.if the cancer comes back, a different course of treatment can be given. if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation.this is a rare type of hodgkin lymphoma that affects around 5% of patients. lphl usually grows at a slower rate than classical hodgkin lymphoma and normally requires less intensive treatment. young people with lphl may have a single swollen gland or group of swollen glands in one area only, such as the neck or groin. the swollen gland often grows very slowly and may be present for many months before a biopsy and diagnosis happens. the biopsy and staging tests will be carried out as with classical hodgkin lymphoma. the treatment given will depend on the stage of the disease, but most patients are diagnosed with an early stage of the disease.lphl is usually treated with surgery or low-dose chemotherapy. it may return many years after treatment, and further treatment may be required, but it is rarely a life-threatening condition. in rare cases, patients have advanced lphl and receive more intensive chemotherapy. there is also a link between lphl and developing a more aggressivenon-hodgkin lymphoma.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",
       " 'Hodgkin lymphoma: Teenagers and young adults': 'this section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called hodgkin lymphoma.treatment for hodgkin lymphoma has a very good success rate and most people are cured.hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is one of the body’s natural defences against infection.lymphomas, like all cancers, are a disease of the body’s cells. normally cells in our body divide and grow in a controlled way. but sometimes cells keep dividing and grow out of control. this is how cancer develops.in lymphomas, white blood cells called lymphocytes become abnormal and grow out of control. these lymphocytes can build up in one part of the body and form a lump (tumour).there are 2 main types of lymphoma:although these cancers are both lymphomas, they are different and need different treatments. your doctors will do tests to find out which type you have.one of the most common symptoms is having a painless lump. the lump is caused by swollen lymph nodes. there may be one or more lumps and these may be in your neck, armpit or groin.lumps can also be inside the body. a commonplace would be inside the chest and this can cause a cough or breathlessness.some people feel tired and lethargic with lymphoma. itching of the skin is also quite common.some people with hodgkin lymphoma have other symptoms such as high temperatures, very heavy sweats (especially at night) and unexplained weight loss. doctors call these symptoms ‘b symptoms’.most of the symptoms that people get with lymphoma may also be caused by other illnesses. for example swollen lymph nodes, high temperatures and sweats may be caused by an infection. but if you have any of these symptoms or are worried that you may have hodgkin lymphoma, go to your gp. they’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.it’s not known what causes hodgkin lymphoma. research is going on to try to find out. remember, though, it isn’t anything that you’ve done.hodgkin lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in young people over the age of 10. about 1 in 6 of all cancers affecting young people between 15 and 24 is a hodgkin lymphoma.hodgkin lymphoma isn’t infectious and can’t be passed on to other people or family members.if you’re looking for information about hodgkin lymphoma in people of all ages, read our generalhodgkin lymphomasection. macmillan cancer support: information and support',\n",
       " 'Huntington’s disease': \"huntington’s disease is a condition that damages nerve cells in the brain causing them to stop working properly. it’s passed on (inherited) from a person’s parents.the damage to the brain gets worse over time. it can affect movement, cognition (perception, awareness, thinking, judgement) and mental health.people can start to show the symptoms of huntington’s disease at almost any age. most will develop problems between the ages of 30 and 50.the condition gradually gets worse for around 10-25 years, until the person dies.behavioural changes are often the first symptoms of huntington’s disease. these changes often include: you’re worried you might have early symptoms of huntington’s disease, especially if there’s a history of the condition in your familyfurther symptoms of huntington’s might include: psychiatric problems – some people developobsessive behaviours, delusional thoughts or behaviours, stubborness, lack of self awareness, orsuicidalthoughts uncontrollable movements of the face, jerking, clicking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body difficulty eating because the mouth and throat muscles don’t work properly which can lead to choking and chest infections communication problems – difficulty putting thoughts into words and slurring of speech sexual problems – a loss of interest in sex or making inappropriate sexual demands balance problemsin the later stages of huntington’s disease, the person will need full nursing care.death is usually from a secondary cause, likepneumoniaor another infection.you might find thepalliative care sectionuseful if you’re caring for someone who’s dying, or if you want to plan your end of life care.juvenile huntington’s disease is a rare form of the condition that can occur in people under the age of 20. common signs include: a rapid decline in school performance changes in handwriting problems with movement, such as slowness, stiffness, tremor or muscle twitching (similar to thefeatures of parkinson’s disease) seizures (fits)huntington’s disease is caused by a faulty gene. cells in parts of the brain are very sensitive to the effects of the faulty gene. this makes them function poorly and eventually die.a parent with the huntington’s disease gene has one good copy of the gene and one faulty copy.this means there’s a: 50:50 chance that each of their children will develop huntington’s disease – affected children can pass the gene to children they may have 50:50 chance that each of their children won’t develop huntington’s disease – unaffected children can’t pass the gene to children they may haveit’s difficult to predict how old a child will be when they develop the condition if they inherit the abnormal gene.in around 3% of cases of huntington’s disease, there’s no obvious family history of the condition. this could be because relatives with the condition died before they were diagnosed with it. in rare cases, it’s due to a new fault in the gene that causes huntington’s disease.if you have symptoms of huntington’s disease, your gp will refer you to a specialist clinician.the specialist will ask about your symptoms to: see if it’s likely you have huntington’s disease rule out similar conditionsthey’ll examine you and test your thinking, eye movements, balance and walking. they’ll find out if you have any

be healthy when you’re tested. this is known as “premanifest huntington’s disease”.if they’ve inherited the faulty gene, they’ll develop huntington’s disease, but it’s not possible to work out

       " 'Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar)': 'hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) can affect people withtype 1 diabetesandtype 2 diabetes, as well as pregnant women with gestational diabetes.it can occasionally affect people who don’t have diabetes, but usually only people who are seriously ill, such as those who have recently had astrokeorheart attack, or have a severe infection.hyperglycaemia shouldn’t be confused withhypoglycaemia, which is when a person’s blood sugar level drops too low.this information focuses on hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes.the aim of diabetes treatment is to keep blood sugar levels as near to normal as possible. but if you have diabetes, no matter how careful you are, you’re likely to experience hyperglycaemia at some point.it’s important to be able to recognise and treat hyperglycaemia, as it can lead to serious health problems if left untreated.occasional mild episodes aren’t usually a cause for concern and can be treated quite easily or may return to normal on their own. however, hyperglycaemia can be potentially dangerous if blood sugar levels become very high or stay high for long periods.very high blood sugar levels can cause life-threatening complications, such as:regularly having high blood sugar levels for long periods of time (over months or years) can result in permanent damage to parts of the body such as the eyes, nerves, kidneys and blood vessels.if you experience hyperglycaemia regularly, speak to your doctor or diabetes care team. you may need to change your treatment or lifestyle to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range.symptoms of hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes tend to develop slowly over a few days or weeks. in some cases, there may be no symptoms until the blood sugar level is very high.symptoms of hyperglycaemia include: increasedthirstand adry mouth needing to pee frequently tiredness blurred vision unintentional weight loss recurrent infections, such as thrush,bladder infections (cystitis)and skin infectionssymptoms of hyperglycaemia can also be due to undiagnosed diabetes, so see your gp if this applies to you. you can have a test to check for the condition.when you’re first diagnosed with diabetes, your diabetes care team will usually tell you what your blood sugar level is and what you should aim to get it down to.you may be advised to use a testing device to monitor your blood sugar level regularly at home, or you may have an appointment with a nurse or doctor every few months to see what your level is.target blood sugar levels differ for everyone, but generally speaking: if you monitor yourself at home – a normal target is 4-7mmol/l before eating and under 8.5-9mmol/l two hours after a meal if you’re tested every few months – a normal target is below 48mmol/mol (or 6.5% on the older measurement scale)a variety of things can trigger an increase in blood sugar level in people with diabetes, including: stress an illness, such as acold eating too much, such as snacking between meals a lack of exercise dehydration missing a dose of your diabetes medication, or taking an incorrect dose over-treating an episode ofhypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) taking certain medicines, such assteroid medicationoccasional episodes of hyperglycaemia can also occur in children and young adults during growth spurts.if you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes and you have symptoms of hyperglycaemia, follow the advice your care team has given you to reduce your blood sugar level.if you’re not sure what to do, contact your gp or care team.you may be advised to: change your diet – for example, you may be advised to avoid foods that cause your blood sugar levels to rise, such as cakes or sugary drinks drink plenty of sugar-free fluids – this can help if you’re dehydrated exercise more often – gentle, regular exercise such as walking can often lower your blood sugar level, particularly if it helps you lose weight if you use insulin, adjust your dose – your care team can give you specific advice about how to do thisyou may also be advised to monitor your blood sugar level more closely, or test your blood or urine for substances called ketones (associated with diabetic ketoacidosis).until your blood sugar level is back under control, watch out for additional symptoms that could be a sign of a more serious condition (see below).contact your diabetes care team immediately if you have a high blood sugar level and experience the following symptoms: feeling or being sick abdominal (tummy) pain rapid, deep breathing signs of dehydration, such as aheadache, dry skin and a weak, rapid heartbeat difficulty staying awakethese symptoms could be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (see above) and you may need to be looked after in hospital.there are simple ways to reduce your risk of severe or prolonged hyperglycaemia: be careful what you eat – be particularly aware of how snacking and eating sugary foods or carbohydrates can affect your blood sugar level. stick to your treatment plan – remember to take your insulin or other diabetes medications as recommended by your care team. be as active as possible – getting regular exercise can help stop your blood sugar level rising, but you should check with your doctor first if you’re taking diabetes medication, as some medicines can lead to hypoglycaemia if you exercise too much take extra care when you’re ill – your care team can provide you with some “sick day rules” that outline what you can do to keep your blood sugar level under control during an illness. monitor your blood sugar level – your care team may suggest using a device to check your level at home, so you can spot an increase early and take steps to stop it.

       " 'Hyperhidrosis': 'hyperhidrosis is a common condition in which a person sweats excessively.the sweating may affect the whole of your body, or it may only affect certain areas. commonly affected areas include the: armpits palms of your hands soles of your feet face and chest groinboth sides of the body are usually affected equally – for example, both feet or both hands.the sweating doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can be embarrassing and distressing. it can also have a negative impact on your quality of life and may lead to feelings ofdepressionandanxiety.read more about thecomplications of hyperhidrosis.there are no guidelines to determine what “normal” sweating is, but if you feel you sweat too much and your sweating has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis.for example, you may have hyperhidrosis if: you avoid physical contact, such as shaking hands, because you feel self-conscious about your sweating you don’t take part in activities, such as dancing or exercise, for fear they will make your sweating worse excessive sweating is interfering with your job – for example, you have difficulty holding tools or using a computer keyboard you’re having problems with normal daily activities, such as driving you’re spending a significant amount of time coping with sweating – for example, frequently showering and changing your clothes you become socially withdrawn and self-consciousvisit your gp if you feel that your sweating is interfering with your daily activities, or you suddenly start sweating excessively.many people with hyperhidrosis are too embarrassed to seek medical help or believe that nothing can be done to improve it. but treatment is available.also visit your gp if you are having night sweats, because it can sometimes be a sign of something more serious.your gp will usually be able to diagnose hyperhidrosis based on your symptoms, although occasionally you may need blood and urine tests to check for an underlying cause (see below).in many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. this is known as primary hyperhidrosis.hyperhidrosis that does have an identifiable cause is known as secondary hyperhidrosis. this can have many different triggers, including: pregnancy or themenopause anxiety certain medications low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) infectionsread more about thecauses of hyperhidrosis.excessive sweating can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find a treatment right for you.doctors usually recommend starting with the least invasive treatment first, such as powerful antiperspirants. lifestyle changes may also help, including: wearing loose and light clothes avoiding triggers, such as alcohol and spicy foods, that could make your sweating worse wearing black or white clothes to help minimise the signs of sweatingif this doesn’t help, you may be advised to try treatments such as iontophoresis (the affected area is treated with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad), botulinum toxin injections, and even surgery in a few cases.hyperhidrosis is usually a long-term condition, but some people experience an improvement with time and the treatments available can often keep the problem under control.read more abouttreating hyperhidrosis.hyperhidrosis is common. it’s been estimated to affect between 1 and 3 in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it in the uk.hyperhidrosis can develop at any age, although primary hyperhidrosis typically starts during childhood or soon after puberty.hyperhidrosis can be divided into 2 types, depending on whether an obvious cause can be identified. these are known as primary and secondary hyperhidrosis.hyperhidrosis that has no obvious cause is known as primary hyperhidrosis.although it’s not clear why it develops, it’s thought to be the result of a problem with part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, and it’s possible your genes may also play a role.the sympathetic nervous system controls most of your body’s functions that do not require conscious thought, such as movement of food through your body and the movement of urine out of your kidneys and into your bladder.the sympathetic nervous system also acts like a thermostat. if it senses you are getting too hot, it will send a signal from your brain to the millions of sweat glands in your body to produce sweat. the sweat cools on your skin and reduces the temperature of your body.a specific type of sweat gland, known as the eccrine glands, appears to be involved in hyperhidrosis. there are more eccrine glands on your armpits, hands, feet and face, which may explain why these areas are often affected by hyperhidrosis.it’s thought that in cases of primary hyperhidrosis, the brain sends signals to the eccrine glands, even though there is no need to cool the body.some cases of primary hyperhidrosis appear to run in families, which suggests a genetic mutation may be the cause.a genetic mutation is where the instructions in your cells become scrambled, which can disrupt the normal workings of the body. some genetic mutations can be passed down from parents to their children.if a cause of hyperhidrosis can be identified, it’s known as secondary hyperhidrosis.secondary hyperhidrosis can have a number of different triggers, including: pregnancy themenopause– when a woman’s monthly periods stop anxiety low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) obesity certain medications – including someantidepressants, propranolol, pilocarpine, and bethanechol being drunk or “high” on drugs, or withdrawing from alcohol or drugs if you have become addicted to them some infections, such astuberculosisandhiv parkinson’s disease disorders of the blood cells or bone marrow, such ashodgkin lymphoma(a cancer of the white blood cells)secondary hyperhidrosis often starts more suddenly than primary hyperhidrosis and tends to affect the whole body.hyperhidrosis can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find the best treatment for you. less invasive treatments will usually be recommended first.changing your lifestyle cannot cure primary hyperhidrosis (hyperhidrosis with no obvious cause), but it can improve your symptoms and help your confidence.the advice below may help. avoid triggers that you know make your sweating worse, such as spicy foods and alcohol use antiperspirant frequently, rather than deodorant avoid wearing tight, restrictive clothing and man-made fibres, such as nylon wearing black or white clothing can minimise signs of sweating armpit shields can absorb excessive sweat and protect your clothes wear socks that absorb moisture, such as thick socks made of natural fibres, or special soles or sports socks designed to absorb moisture avoid wearing socks made out of man-made materials and change your socks at least twice a day if possible ideally wear shoes made of leather, and try to alternate between different pairs of shoes every dayif a regular antiperspirant doesn’t control your sweating, your gp may prescribe or suggest a stronger one for you.antiperspirant containing aluminium chloride is often used to treat hyperhidrosis. this works by plugging the sweat glands. you will need to apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning.the most common side effect of aluminium chloride is mild irritation or itching and tingling where it is applied. using the antiperspirant less frequently can help reduce irritation. using emollients (moisturisers) regularly and soap substitutes instead of soap may also help.you may be prescribed a type of medicine called an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic. these work by blocking the effects of a chemical called acetylcholine, which the nervous system uses to activate the sweat glands.anticholinergics are available as tablets or solutions that are applied to affected areas. they’re not widely used to treat hyperhidrosis and most types are not licensed to treat it, but some people find them helpful.propantheline bromide is an anticholinergic medicine licensed for treating hyperhidrosis. however, anticholinergic medicines unlicensed for hyperhidrosis – such as oxybutynin and glycopyrronium bromide – can also be prescribed if your doctor feels they might help.possible side effects of anticholinergics include adry mouth, blurred vision, stomach cramps,constipationand difficulty passing urine.if lifestyle changes and treatment don’t work, your gp may refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) for further treatment, such as iontophoresis, botulinum toxin or surgery.iontophoresis may help if you have excessive sweating that affects your hands or feet. it can also be used to treat armpits, although this is usually less effective.iontophoresis involves treating affected areas of skin with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad. this is thought to help block the sweat glands.if your hands and feet need treating, you place them in a bowl of water and a weak electric current is passed through the water. if your armpits need treating, a wet contact pad is placed against each armpit and a current is passed through the pad.the treatment is not painful but the electric current can cause mild, short-lived discomfort and skin irritation.each session of iontophoresis lasts between 20 and 30 minutes, and you will usually need to have 2 to 4 sessions a week. your symptoms should begin to improve after a week or 2, after which further treatment will be required at 1 to 4 week intervals, depending on how severe your symptoms are.iontophoresis is often very effective, although you may need to make regular visits to your local hospital’s dermatology clinic to receive treatment.alternatively, iontophoresis kits that you can use at home may be recommended, with prices in the range of £250-500.botulinum toxin can be injected into the skin in areas of the body affected by hyperhidrosis. this helps reduce sweating in these areas by blocking the signals from the brain to the sweat glands.around 15-20 injections are given in the affected areas of the body, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. the procedure usually takes about 30-45 minutes in total.the effect of the injections usually lasts for several months, after which time the treatment can be repeated if necessary.potential side effects of botulinum toxin injections include: pain, redness or itching where the injections are given nausea, headaches and hot flushes after the injections are given another part of your body sweating more to make up for treated area – known as compensatory sweating muscle weakness around the treatment areamost of these side effects are short-lived or will resolve as the effect of the injections wears off.availability of botulinum toxin on the nhs can vary widely depending on your clinical commissioning group (ccg), and you may only be able to get it privately. costs for private treatment depend on the part of the body being treated. for example, injecting the forehead can cost around £150, while treating both armpits could cost up to £450 or more.in a few cases where hyperhidrosis is particularly severe and treatment hasn’t been successful, surgery may be recommended.endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ets) is the most widely used type of surgery to treat hyperhidrosis. it’s usually used in cases affecting the palms or armpits.small incisions are made in the side of the chest and the nerves that control sweating in the affected area are cut or clipped. this means signals can no longer pass along them to the sweat glands. the operation is carried out undergeneral anaestheticand done on both sides of the body.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends that ets can be used to treat excessive sweating of the palms or underarms. however, before the procedure is performed, your clinician should explain: ets carries a risk of serious complications (see below) it’s very common for excessive compensatory sweating to occur after the procedure, which causes some people to regret the procedure the procedure is not always successful at reducing sweatingfor this reason, only people with severe hyperhidrosis which hasn’t responded to treatment should be considered.read the fullnice guidelines on endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb.side effects and complications of ets can also include: sweating of the face and neck after eating food – this is known as gustatory sweating and may affect up to half of people who have the procedure bleeding into the chest during surgery air becoming trapped inside the chest (pneumothorax), which can cause chest pain and breathing difficulties damage to the nervous system that causes the upper eyelid on one side of the body to droop (horner’s syndrome) – this may be permanentexcessive sweating under the arms may occasionally be treated with a procedure to remove or destroy the sweat glands in the armpits.this can be carried out in a number of ways: making an incision in the armpit and carefully scraping away (curettage) or cutting out (shelley’s procedure) the sweat glands using a probe held above the skin (no incisions are needed), which emits electromagnetic radiation that destroys the sweat glands inserting a laser device under the skin through a small incision and using it to destroy the sweat glandsthese procedures are generally carried out underlocal anaesthetic, which means you will be awake but your armpit will be numbed.these procedures can sometimes be a permanent solution to excessive underarm sweating, although they are only carried out by a small number of practitioners. availability on the nhs is likely to be very limited and you will probably need to pay for private treatment.these procedures don’t work for everyone and some of them are relatively new, which means there isn’t always evidence about their long-term safety and effectiveness.feelings of anxiety are not directly responsible for causing primary hyperhidrosis, but they can make the situation worse and create a vicious cycle.you may feel self-conscious, which can trigger anxiety in certain situations, such as when meeting new people or being in a crowded room. the anxiety can make the sweating worse.if your anxiety is making your sweating worse, a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) might help. medication for anxiety is not usually recommended because it can make sweating worse.hyperhidrosis doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can sometimes lead to physical and emotional problems.hyperhidrosis increases the risk of developing fungal infections, particularly on the feet – most commonlyfungal nail infectionsand athlete’s foot. this is because excessive sweat combined with wearing socks and shoes creates an ideal surrounding for fungi to grow.fungal infections can be treated with antifungal creams. more severe cases may require antifungal tablets or capsules.excessive sweat can make you more vulnerable to certain skin conditions, such as: warts– small, rough lumps on the skin that are caused by the hpv virus boils – swollen red-yellow bumps in the skin that can develop when a hair follicle becomes infectedeczemacan also be made worse by excessive sweating.although people with hyperhidrosis sweat a lot, most don’t have problems with body odour. this is because hyperhidrosis doesn’t usually affect the sweat glands responsible for producing unpleasant-smelling sweat – called the aprocrine sweat glands.however, if bacteria are allowed to break down the sweat, it can start to smell unpleasant. eating spicy food and drinking alcohol can also make sweat secreted from the eccrine smell.this can be prevented or eased by following lifestyle advice, such as frequently using antiperspirant spray and using armpit shields to absorb sweat.seetreating hyperhidrosisfor more information.the emotional impact of living with hyperhidrosis can be severe. many people with the condition feel unhappy and, in some cases, depressed. signs that you may be depressed include: feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during the past month having little interest or pleasure in things during the past monthit is important not to neglect your mental health. make an appointment to see your gp if you think that you may be depressed.read more aboutdepressionor find out more about tackling stress, anxiety and depression.',\n",
       " 'Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)': 'hypoglycaemia, or a “hypo”, is an abnormally low level of glucose in your blood (less than four millimoles per litre).when your glucose (sugar) level is too low, your body doesn’t have enough energy to carry out its activities.hypoglycaemia is most commonly associated withdiabetes, and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard.in rare cases, it’s possible for a person who doesn’t have diabetes to experience hypoglycaemia. it can be triggered bymalnutrition, binge drinking or certain conditions, such asaddison’s disease.read more about thecauses of hypoglycaemiamost people will have some warning that their blood glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. in more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. in very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness.it’s also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking.read more about thesymptoms of hypoglycaemiathe immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some food or drink that contains sugar, such as dextrose tablets or fruit juice, to correct your blood glucose levels.after having something sugary, you may need to have a longer-acting “starchy” carbohydrate food, such as a sandwich or a few biscuits.if hypoglycaemia causes a loss of consciousness, an injection of the hormone glucagon can be given to raise blood glucose levels and restore consciousness. this is only if an injection is available and the person giving the injection knows how to use it.you should dial 999 to request an ambulance if: a glucagon injection kit isn’t available there’s nobody trained to give the injection the injection is ineffective after 10 minutesnever try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who’s drowsy or unconscious as they could choke. this includes some of the high-sugar preparations specifically designed for smearing inside the cheek.read more abouttreating hypoglycaemiaif you have diabetes that requires treatment with insulin, the safest way to avoid hypoglycaemia is to regularly check your blood sugar and learn to recognise the early symptoms.missing meals or snacks or eating less carbohydrate than planned can increase your risk of hypoglycaemia. you should be careful when drinkingalcoholas it can also cause hypoglycaemia, sometimes many hours after drinking.exercise or activity is another potential cause, and you should have a plan for dealing with this, such as eating carbohydrate before, during or after exercise, or adjusting your insulin dose.you should also make sure you regularly change where you inject insulin as the amount of insulin your body absorbs can differ depending on where it’s injected.always carry rapid-acting carbohydrate with you, such as glucose tablets, a carton of fruit juice (one that contains sugar), or some sweets in case you feel symptoms coming on or your blood glucose level is low.make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the risk of hypoglycaemia. it may also help to carry some form of identification that lets people know about your condition in an emergency.when hypoglycaemia occurs as the result of an underlying condition other than diabetes, the condition will need to be treated to prevent a further hypo.read more aboutpreventing hypoglycaemiathe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually begin when your blood glucose level drops below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.if you havediabetes, particularly if it’s treated with insulin, you may be advised to use a small device called a blood glucose meter to regularly check your blood glucose levels.symptoms can vary from person to person, and it’s important to be aware of the early warning signs so you can treat them.signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia can include: feeling hungry sweating dizziness tiredness (fatigue) blurred vision trembling or shakiness going pale fast pulse orpalpitations tingling lips irritability difficulty concentrating confusion disorderly or irrational behaviour, which may be mistaken for drunkennessif hypoglycaemia isn’t treated promptly and your blood glucose levels drop low enough, you may become drowsy or even lose consciousness.most people with insulin-treated diabetes notice that the symptoms of hypoglycaemia change and become less obvious the longer they live with the condition.for some people, the warning symptoms become greatly reduced, putting them at significant risk of having severe episodes where they’re dependent on others for help.let your diabetes care team know if you develop this problem as your treatment may need to be changed to reduce the risk.read more abouthow hypoglycaemia is treatedhaving a hypo while you’re asleep is known as nocturnal hypoglycaemia. it’s more common in people who treat diabetes with insulin.although some people find their sleep is disturbed when they experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia, you may only notice the symptoms when you wake up in the morning.the symptoms of nocturnal hypoglycaemia can include: headache– often likened to having a hangover feeling unusually tired in the morning damp sheets or clothing from sweatingin most cases, hypoglycaemia affects people withdiabetes, although more rarely it can also occur as a result of other underlying conditions.a common cause of hypoglycaemia is taking too much insulin for your current needs. insulin is a medication that helps control your blood glucose levels. it’s commonly used to treattype 1 diabetesand is also recommended for some people withtype 2 diabetes.a fall in blood glucose levels can also occur after taking too much oral hypoglycaemia medication, such as sulphonylurea, which causes a release of insulin. this medication is often used to lower blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes.for people with type 1 diabetes, maintaining the correct blood glucose level involves balancing how much insulin you inject, the amount of food you eat, and how much energy you burn during exercise.hypoglycaemia may occur if you’ve taken your dose of insulin as usual, but your carbohydrate intake is lower than normal or has been used up more quickly. this may happen if you delay or miss a meal or snack, don’t eat enough carbohydrate, or exercise more than usual.people with diabetes who’ve drunk too much alcohol, or drank alcohol on an empty stomach, can also get hypoglycaemia.however, it’s not always possible to identify why a particular episode of hypoglycaemia has occurred, and sometimes it happens for no obvious reason.hypoglycaemia – even mild cases – is very rare in people who don’t have diabetes. the possible causes are outlined below.people without diabetes can sometimes experience hypoglycaemia if their pancreas produces too much insulin after a large carbohydrate-based meal. this is known as reactive hypoglycaemia.it’s not clear why this happens, although it’s thought to be more common in people who are overweight or have had gastric bypass surgery.in rare cases, a benign (non-cancerous) tumour in the pancreas may cause an overproduction of insulin, or the tumour itself may use up too much glucose.other possible causes of hypoglycaemia in people without diabetes are: fasting ormalnutrition– where not enough nutrients are consumed for your body to function properly binge drinking or heavy drinking of alcohol addison’s disease– a disorder of the adrenal glands (two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys) certain medication – hypoglycaemia has been known to occur in people taking quinine (formalaria), salicylates (for rheumatic disease) and propranolol (forhigh blood pressure) severe illnesses affecting the liver, kidneys or thyroid glandin most cases, you can treat hypoglycaemia yourself when you recognise the symptoms.the immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some sugary food or drink (about 15 to 20g of rapidly acting carbohydrate) to end the attack.for example, this could be: a glass of fruit juice or non-diet soft drink between three and five dextrose tablets a handful of sweetsat first you should avoid fatty foods and drinks, such as chocolate and milk, because they don’t usually contain as much sugar and the sugar they do contain may be absorbed more slowly.after having something sugary, you should have a longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar, a piece of fruit or a sandwich.it will usually take around 15 minutes to recover from a mild episode of hypoglycaemia. if you have a blood glucose meter, measure your blood sugar again after 15 to 20 minutes. if it’s still too low (below 4mmol), you should have some more sugary food or a drink before testing your levels again in another 15 to 20 minutes.when treating someone else with hypoglycaemia, if the above treatment isn’t effective, you may be able to help them by applying glucose gel (or honey, treacle or jam if glucose gel isn’t available) to the inside of their cheeks, and gently massaging the outside of their cheeks.it may take 10 to 15 minutes before they feel better. this shouldn’t be done if the person is drowsy or unconscious because of the risk of choking.if you have several episodes of hypoglycaemia a week, you should contact your diabetes care team to find out the underlying cause. your medication may need to be adjusted, or there may be another condition causing hypoglycaemia that needs to be treated.if a person loses consciousness because of severe hypoglycaemia, they need to be put into therecovery positionand given an injection of the hormone glucagon (if they have an injection kit). the injection will raise their blood glucose level.the injection should be carried out by a friend or family member who knows what they’re doing, or by a trained healthcare professional.you should dial 999 to request an ambulance if: a glucagon injection kit isn’t available there’s nobody available who’s trained to give the injection the injection is ineffective after 10 minutesnever try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who’s unconscious as they could choke.if you’re able to give a glucagon injection and the person regains consciousness, they should eat some longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar or a sandwich.you should continue to monitor the person for signs of recurring symptoms in case they need to be treated again.if you have diabetes, sticking to your medication plan and eating regular meals can help prevent hypoglycaemia.it’s also important to monitor your blood glucose levels.regularly monitoring your blood glucose levels can help you keep your blood glucose as normal and stable as possible, and will help you spot thesigns and symptoms of hypoglycaemiaquickly.your blood glucose level can vary throughout the day, so you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you’re taking.you can monitor your blood glucose levels using a blood glucose meter, a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood.read more aboutliving with type 1 diabetesandliving with type 2 diabetesif you have diabetes, strenuous physical activity can lead to hypoglycaemia. eating extra carbohydrate-based foods before and during exercise can help reduce the chances of this happening.if you’re taking insulin, your doctor may advise you to lower your dose before you do strenuous physical activity.alcohol can also affect your body’s ability to release glucose. if you havetype 1 diabetes, it’s recommended that you drink no more than 2 to 3units of alcohola day and eat a snack after drinking alcohol.as hypoglycaemia can develop suddenly, it’s important to be aware of thesymptoms of hypoglycaemiaso you can treat it quickly. tell your family and friends about the

your doctor may recommend medications such as glucose gel to carry with you. this can be used to treat hypoglycaemia that doesn’t respond to normal treatment.if you’re being treated with insulin, you’ll usually be given a kit that contains an injection of a medication called glucagon. family members or your carer can be trained to carry out the injection, which should be used if you lose consciousness because of severe hypoglycaemia.it’s important to avoid recurrent hypoglycaemia during the night (nocturnal hypoglycaemia) as it can reduce the early symptoms of daytime episodes.if you experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia, you can try: keeping something sugary by your bedside having a snack before bedtime, such as biscuits and milk checking your blood glucose levels between 3am and

       " 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis': 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a condition in which the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.it’s not clear what causes it, but it usually affects people around 70-75 years of age and is rare in people under 50.several treatments can help reduce the rate at which ipf gets worse, but there’s currently no treatment that can stop or reverse the scarring of the lungs.the symptoms of ipf tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time.symptoms can include: shortness of breath a persistent drycough tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers)many people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. but eventually even light activity such as getting dressed can cause shortness of breath.see your gp if you’ve struggled with your breathing for a while or have had a cough for more than three weeks.these symptoms aren’t normal and shouldn’t be ignored.if your gp thinks you could have a lung condition such as ipf, they can refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as: breathing (lung function) tests blood tests a chestx-rayandcomputerised tomography (ct) scan a lungbiopsy(where a small piece of lung tissue is removed during keyhole surgery so it can be analysed)read more about thetests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.in people with ipf, the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and increasingly scarred. this causes the lungs to become stiff and means it’s difficult for oxygen to get into the blood.the reason this happens isn’t clear. idiopathic means the cause is unknown.ipf has been linked to: exposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust viral infections a family history of ipf – around 1 in 20 people with ipf has another family member with the condition gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) smokingbut it’s not known whether some of these factors directly cause ipf.there’s currently no cure for ipf, but there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow down its progression.treatments include: self-care measures – such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly medication to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens – such as pirfenidone and nintedanib breathing oxygen through a mask – you can do this while you’re at home and/or while you’re out and about pulmonary rehabilitation – exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily alung transplant– this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rareread more abouthow idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is treated.ipf gets worse over time, although the speed at which this happens is highly variable.some people respond well to treatment and remain relatively free of symptoms for many years, while others may get rapidly worse or find the breathlessness debilitating.other problems can also sometimes develop, includingchest infections,pulmonary hypertensionandheart failure.it’s very difficult to predict how long someone with ipf will survive at the time of diagnosis. regular monitoring over time can indicate whether it’s getting worse quickly or slowly.before the availability of specific treatments like pirfenidone and nintedanib about half of people with ipf lived at least three years from their diagnosis. around 1 in 5 survived for more than five years.it’s hoped these figures will be improved by the availability of new treatments to slow the disease’s progression.the most common symptom of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is shortness of breath, often when physically active, which can get worse over time.at first, many people ignore their breathlessness (especially older patients) and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. but as the disease progresses and lung damage becomes more severe, even light activity like getting dressed or having a shower can cause breathlessness.other symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis include: a persistent drycough tiredness loss of appetite and weight lossin up to half of all cases, there is also a change in the shape of the finger and toenails. this thickening of tissue at the base of the finger and toenails is known as digital clubbing. the exact cause of clubbing is unknown, but it can occur in people with various chest and heart diseases.the strain ipf can place on your lungs and your heart can trigger a number of secondary conditions, outlined below.you will have an increased risk of developing chest and airway infections such as: bronchitis– an infection of the airway of the lungs pneumonia– an infection of the air sacs of your lungs influenza (flu)symptoms of a chest infection include: worsening breathlessness chest pain a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or above sweating and shiveringaround a third of people with ipf will also go on to developpulmonary hypertension. pulmonary hypertension is when blood pressure inside the arteries connecting the lungs to the heart is dangerously high.symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include: dizziness feeling faint chest pain (angina) a racing heartbeat (tachycardia)read more aboutsymptoms of pulmonary hypertension.heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body, can develop when ipf becomes severe.this is due to a combination of factors, including a build-up of blood in the right side of the heart (the side that pumps blood to the lungs), which develops because it is difficult to pump blood through the scarred lung tissue. the poor supply of oxygen from the diseased lungs to the heart muscle also contributes to heart failure.heart failure can cause various symptoms, including: worsening breathlessness extreme tiredness and weakness swelling in the legs, ankles and feet (oedema) caused by a build-up of fluidread more about thesymptoms of heart failure.the exact cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is not known. idiopathic means having no known cause.the current theory is that ipf is triggered when cells that line the lung alveoli (air sacs) become damaged by exposure to one of several substances or viruses.the damaged cells try to repair themselves but the process becomes uncontrolled, resulting in thickening and scarring (fibrosis) of the alveoli and surrounding lung tissue. the amount of oxygen that can pass from the lungs into the blood is then significantly reduced.a number of factors have been suggested as possible triggers for the initial damage to the cells lining the alveoli. most experts agree that the two most significant risk factors are: being a smoker or having smoked in the past occupational exposure to certain types of dust – jobs that involve working with wood, metal, textile, stone, cattle or farming may increase the risk of ipfother possible risk factors include: viral infections – such as the epstein-barr virus orhepatitis c gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord)(where the acid from your stomach rises back up into your throat) – this may be accidentally inhaled into the lungs, causing damage to the alveoli chronic aspiration – where food, drink or saliva enter the lungs and is not coughed back up, often due to a related condition environmental pollutants or dust genetic tendency – the condition appears to run in some families but this only seems to be the case in around 5% of people with ipfas ipf is such a rare condition it is hard to estimate how much of an impact these risk factors can have on your chance of developing it.idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) can be hard to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to other lung conditions, such aschronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).your gp can refer you to hospital specialists for a number of tests to help rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis.the checks and tests you may have include:medical history and examinationbreathing and blood testschest x-ray and ct scanbronchoscopylung biopsyyour doctor will ask about your medical history and whether there are other factors that could be causing a problem with your lungs, such as whether you: smoke or have smoked in the past have been exposed to harmful substances at work, such as asbestos have other medical conditionsthey may also: check the sound of your breathing through a stethoscope – a crackling sound can suggest lung scarring (fibrosis) look at your fingers to see if the ends are swollen (finger clubbing) ask you to walk around for a few minutes to see if you become breathlesslung function tests (also called pulmonary function tests) assess how well your lungs work and can help indicate what the problem may be.these tests measure: how quickly you can move air in and out of your lungs how much air your lungs can hold how well your lungs transfer oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide from it (this can be checked using ablood test)a commonly used lung function test is spirometry. during the test, you breathe into a mouthpiece that’s attached to a monitor.a chestx-raydoesn’t show the lungs in much detail, but it can help doctors spot some more obvious problems that could be causing your symptoms, such as cancer or a build-up of fluid.if ipf is suspected, the chest x-ray will be followed by acomputerised tomography (ct) scan.a ct scan is similar to an x-ray, but lots more images are taken and these are put together by a computer to create a more detailed image of your lungs.this can help your doctor spot signs of scarring in your lungs.if doctors still aren’t sure what the problem is after the tests described above, they may suggest having a bronchoscopy.this is a test where a narrow, flexible tube with a camera (bronchoscope) is passed down into your airways.your doctor can then look for anything abnormal and can take small tissue samples for testing.you’ll usually be awake for a bronchoscopy and it may cause coughing.local anaestheticwill be used to numb your throat so it doesn’t hurt and you may also be given a sedative injection which will make you feel sleepy during the procedure.if other tests aren’t conclusive, a lungbiopsymay need to be carried out.this involves keyhole surgery to remove a small sample of lung tissue so it can be analysed for signs of scarring.the procedure is performed under ageneral anaesthetic(where you’re asleep). your surgeon makes several small incisions (cuts) in your side and an endoscope (a thin tube with a camera and a light at the end) is inserted into the area between the lungs and the chest wall.the surgeon can see the lung tissue through the endoscope and is able obtain a small sample.there’s currently no cure for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf). the main aim of treatment is to relieve the symptoms as much as possible and slow down its progression.the main treatments are:self-caremedicationoxygen supportpulmonary rehabilitationlung transplantas the condition becomes more advanced,end of life (palliative) carewill be offered.there are several things you can do to stay as healthy as possible if you have ipf.these include: stopping smokingif you smoke exercise regularlyand stay as fit as you can eat ahealthy, balanced diet make sure you get the annual flu jab and one-off pneumococcal vaccination – these infections can be more serious if you have a lung condition try to keep away from people withchest infectionsandcoldswhenever possiblethere are two medications that can help slow down the progression of ipf in some people: pirfenidone and nintedanib.some people also take a medication called n-acetylcysteine, although its benefits are uncertain.pirfenidone helps to slow the development of scarring in the lungs by reducing the activity of the immune system. it’s normally taken as capsules three times a day.it’s recommended if breathing tests have shown your lung capacity is 50-80% of what would normally be expected.if your condition gets worse despite taking pirfenidone and your lung capacity falls by 10% or more within a year, the medication will usually be stopped.side effects of pirfenidone can include: feeling sick tiredness diarrhoea indigestion a rash caused by exposure to sunlightfor further information see, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) guidelines onpirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.nintedanib is a newer medication that can also help slow down scarring of the lungs in some people with ipf. it’s normally taken as capsules twice a day.like pirfenidone, it may be used if you have a lung capacity 50-80% of what would normally be expected and should be stopped if your lung capacity falls by 10% or more in a year while taking it.side effects of nintedanib can include: diarrhoea feeling and being sick abdominal (tummy) pain loss of appetite and weight lossfor further information, see the nice guidelines onnintedanib for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.n-acetylcysteine is what’s known as an antioxidant. it’s available from many health shops and is usually taken as tablets.there is some limited evidence to suggest it may reduce the amount of scar tissue in the lungs, although other studies have not shown any benefit.if you’re considering taking n-acetylcysteine, you should check with your specialist first as it may not be safe or suitable for everyone with ipf.ipf can cause levels of oxygen in your blood fall, which can make you feel more breathless.if this happens, oxygen treatment can help with your breathing and allow you to be more active.oxygen is taken through nasal tubes or a mask attached to a small machine. this device provides a much higher level of oxygen than the air. the tubes from the machine are long, so you’ll be able to move around your home while connected.read further abouthome oxygen treatment.portable oxygen devices that you can use while you’re out and about are also available.pulmonary rehabilitation is used for many long-term lung conditions and aims to help patients come to terms with their condition, learn the best ways to deal with it and improve their ability to function on a daily basis without severe breathlessness.courses in pulmonary rehabilitation are usually held locally and may involve: education about pulmonary fibrosis physical activity breathing exercises advice on nutrition psychological support a social support networkif your condition continues to get worse despite treatment, your specialist may recommend alung transplant. the decision to have a transplant will be based on: how bad your condition is how quickly your condition is getting worse your age and general health how much your condition is likely to improve after a transplant whether a donor lung is availablea lung transplant can significantly improve life expectancy in people with ipf, although it’s a major procedure that puts a great strain on the body.few people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are suitable candidates for a transplant and donor lungs are scarce.if you’re told there is nothing more that can be done to treat your ipf or you decide to decline treatment, your gp or care team will provide you

       " 'Impetigo': 'impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. it’s not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment.impetigo is the most common skin infection in young children in the uk, but it can affect people of all ages.there are 2 types of impetigo: non-bullous impetigo – the most common type bullous impetigothe symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected.the sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. the appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.after the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. the time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.the sores aren’t painful, but they may be itchy. it’s important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people.other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) andswollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.the symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. the blisters are usually about 1cm to 2cm across.the blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring.the blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. as with non-bullous impetigo, it’s important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.adults and children over 2 years with impetigo can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. find your local pharmacy on scotland’s service directory.impetigo isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your gp practice if required.impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes.the bacteria can infect the skin in 2 main ways: through a break in otherwise healthy skin – such as acut,insect biteor other injury – this is known as primary impetigo through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such ashead lice,scabiesoreczema– this is known as secondary impetigothe bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels.as the condition doesn’t cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it’s often easily spread to others unintentionally.children and people withdiabetesor a weakened immune system – either due to a condition such ashivor a treatment such aschemotherapy– are most at risk of developing impetigo.impetigo usually gets better without treatment in around 2 to 3 weeks.however, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days and can lower the risk of the infection being spread to others.the main treatments prescribed areantibioticcreams or antibiotic tablets. these usually have to be used for around a week.read abouttreating impetigo.during treatment, it’s important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or to other areas of the body.most people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. it’s important to stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this point.the advice below can also help to prevent the spread of the infection: do not share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo – wash them at a high temperature after use wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing avoid touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them – it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym – until the risk of infection has passed wash your hands frequently – particularly after touching infected skin washable toys should also be washed – wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completelyif you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they’re seen by a pharmacist as soon as possible.to reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly.if you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. these bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby.if you’re found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for 5 to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring.complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse.some complications associated with impetigo include: cellulitis– an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue scarlet fever– a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body guttatepsoriasis– a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection septicaemia (a type ofsepsis) – a bacterial infection of the blood staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (ssss) – a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis – an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneysin very rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or soresimpetigo does not cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after you first become infected. this means that people can easily pass the infection on to others without realising it.there are 2 main types of impetigo, known as non-bullous and bullous impetigo, which have different symptoms. most people with impetigo have the non-bullous type.the symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected.the sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. the appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.after the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually heals without scarring. the time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.the sores are not painful, but they may be itchy. it is important not to touch, or scratch, the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of your body, and to other people.other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) andswollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.the symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the trunk (the central part of the body between the waist and neck) or on the arms and legs. the blisters are usually about 1cm to 2cm across.the blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring.the blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. as with non-bullous impetigo, it is important that you do not touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes.these bacteria can infect the skin in 2 ways: through a break in otherwise healthy skin, such as a cut,insect biteor other injury – this is known as primary impetigo through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such ashead lice,scabiesoreczema– this is known as secondary impetigothe bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels.as the condition does not cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it is often easily spread to others unintentionally.impetigo stops being infectious after 48 hours of treatment starting or after the sores have stopped blistering or crusting.in addition to the situations mentioned above, there are a number of other factors that can increase your chances of developing impetigo. these include: being a child – impetigo is thought to be more common in children because their immune system has not yet fully developed and because they tend to spend time in places where the infection can easily be spread, such as schools and nurseries havingdiabetes being a carrier of staphylococcus aureus bacteria – these bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, but they can sometimes cause impetigo if they get into damaged skin nearby warm and humid weather – impetigo tends to be more common during the summer months in the uk, possibly because the warm and moist weather is a better environment for the bacteria to grow and/or because the skin is more likely to be exposed to insect bites and cuts at this time of year having a weakened immune system, either due to a condition such ashivor a treatment such aschemotherapyimpetigo isn’t usually serious and often clears up without treatment after 2 to 3 weeks.treatment is often recommended as it can help clear up the infection in around 7 to 10 days and reduce the risk of the infection being passed on to others.if impetigo is confirmed, it can usually be effectively treated withantibiotics.if the infection is being caused by an underlying skin condition, such aseczema, this may also need to be treated.for mild cases of impetigo that cover a small area, antibiotic cream is often recommended. this usually needs to be applied 3 or 4 times a day for 7 days.before applying the cream, wash any affected areas of skin with warm, soapy water and try to clean off any crusts that have developed.to reduce the risk of spreading the infection, it’s also important that you wash your hands immediately after applying the cream or, if available, wear latex gloves while applying the cream.side effects of antibiotic cream can include: irritation redness itchiness in the area where the cream is appliedif symptoms haven’t improved after seven days of starting treatment, ask your pharmacist about other possible treatment options.antibiotic tablets may be prescribed if the infection is more severe and widespread, or if the symptoms don’t improve after using antibiotic cream. these usually need to be taken 2 to 4 times a day for 7 days.if a course of oral antibiotics is prescribed for you or your child, it’s very important that the course is finished even if the symptoms clear up before you’ve taken all the tablets.common side effects of oral antibiotics include: feeling sick vomiting diarrhoeaspeak to your pharmacist if your symptoms haven’t improved after 7 days of treatment with antibiotic tablets.further tests are usually only required in cases where the infection is severe or widespread, doesn’t respond to treatment, or keeps recurring.in these circumstances, your gp may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for further tests or they may take a swab of the affected skin themselves for testing.this can help to rule out or confirm other skin conditions that may be responsible for your symptoms and can detect whether you carry one of the types of bacteria responsible for the infection inside your nose.if your doctor thinks you may keep getting impetigo because you naturally have these bacteria inside your nose, they may prescribe you an antiseptic nasal cream to try to clear the bacteria.complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse.cellulitisoccurs when the infection spreads to a deeper layer of skin. it can cause symptoms of red, inflamed skin with fever and pain. it can usually be treated with antibiotics, and painkillers can be used to relieve pain.guttatepsoriasisis a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection. it is usually more common after a throat infection, but some cases have been linked to impetigo.guttate psoriasis causes small, red, droplet-shaped, scaly patches on the chest, arms, legs and scalp.creams can be used to control the symptoms and in some cases the condition will disappear completely after a few weeks.scarlet feveris a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body. associated symptoms of infection, such as nausea, pain and vomiting, are also common. the condition is usually treated with antibiotics.scarlet fever is not usually serious but it is contagious. therefore, it’s important to isolate an infected child and avoid close physical contact. keep your child away from school and other people until they have been taking antibiotics for at least 24 hours.septicaemia (a type ofsepsis) is a bacterial infection of the blood. it can cause: diarrhoea cold, clammy skin a high temperature (fever) rapid breathing vomiting low blood pressure(hypotension) confusion feeling faint and dizzy losing consciousnesssepticaemia is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics in hospital.in rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring. however, this is more often the result of someone scratching at blisters, crusts or sores. theblistersand crusts themselves should not leave a scar if left to heal.the red mark left after the crusts and blisters clear up should also disappear by itself. the time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (ssss) is a serious skin condition in which one of the causes of impetigo – staphylococcus bacteria – releases a toxin (poison) that damages the skin.this leads to extensive blistering that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water.other symptoms of ssss include: painful skin a high temperature (fever) large areas of skin peeling off or falling away redness of the skin which usually spreads across the entire bodyssss usually requires immediate treatment in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys. it’s a very rare complication of impetigo.the symptoms of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis include: a change in the colour of your urine to a reddish-brown or cola colour swelling of the abdomen (tummy), face, eyes, feet and ankles a rise in blood pressure visible blood in your urine a reduction in the amount of urine you would normally producepeople with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis will usually require immediate hospital treatment so their blood pressure can be carefully monitored and controlled.post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can be fatal in adults, although deaths in children are rare.as impetigo is a highly contagious condition, it is important to take precautions to reduce the risk of the infection spreading.to help to prevent the spread of the infection to other people or to other areas of the body you should: stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until the sores have dried up, blistered or crusted over, or until 48 hours after starting treatment not share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo, and wash them at a high temperature after use wash the sores with soap and water, and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing if possible avoid touching the sores, or letting others touch them, whenever possible not scratch the affected areas – it may help to ensure your or your child’s nails are kept clean and short to reduce the risk of further damage caused by scratching avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym until the risk of infection has passed (when the rash has crusted over, or after at least 48 hours of treatment with antibiotics) wash your hands frequently, particularly after touching infected skin washable toys should also be washed, and wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completelyif you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they contact their pharmacist as soon as possible.to reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean, and

       " 'Indigestion': 'indigestion can be pain or discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia) or burning pain behind the breastbone (heartburn).dyspepsia andheartburnmay occur together or on their own. symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking.common associated symptoms include: feeling full or bloated feeling sick (nausea) belching bringing up (regurgitating) fluid or food into the gullet (oesophagus)indigestion is a common problem that affects many people, but in most cases it’s mild and only occurs occasionally.read more about thesymptoms of indigestion.indigestion may be caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). the stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful.the majority of people with indigestion don’t have inflammation in their digestive system. therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching).in most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress or taking certain medications.read more about thecauses of indigestion.most people are able to treat indigestion with simple changes to their diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different medications, such as antacids.read more about thetreatment of indigestion.very rarely, a serious underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion. if this is suspected, then further investigation such as an endoscopy will be required.if you have symptoms of indigestion you can get treatment directly from a pharmacy. find your local pharmacy on scotland’s service directory.most people will not need to seek medical advice for their indigestion. however, your pharmacist may advise you see your gp if you have recurring indigestion and any of the following apply: you are 55 years old or over you have lost a lot of weight without meaning to you have increasingdifficulty swallowing (dysphagia) you have persistent vomiting you haveiron deficiency anaemia you have a lump in your stomach you have blood in your vomit or blood in your stoolsthis is because these symptoms may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as astomach ulcerorstomach cancer. you may need to be referred for an endoscopy to rule out any serious cause.an endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end).severe indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach. read more about the possiblecomplications of severe indigestion.the main symptom of indigestion is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia). people often experience the associated feeling of burning behind the breastbone (heartburn), but this may occur on its own.these symptoms usually come on soon after eating or drinking, although there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and experiencing indigestion.heartburnis caused by acid that passes from your stomach into your gullet (oesophagus).if you have indigestion, you may also have symptoms such as: feeling uncomfortably full or heavy belching orflatulence(passing wind) bringing food or fluid back up from your stomach (reflux) bloating feeling sick (nausea) vomitingindigestion has a number of different causes, but it’s rarely due to a serious, underlying condition.it’s normal for your stomach to produce acid, but sometimes this acid can irritate the lining of your stomach, the top part of your bowel (duodenum) or your gullet (oesophagus).this irritation can be painful and often causes a burning sensation. indigestion may also be due to the lining of your digestive system being overly sensitive to acid, or the ‘stretching’ caused by eating.indigestion can also be triggered or made worse by other factors.you may have indigestion if you take certain types of medication. some medicines, such as nitrates (taken to widen your blood vessels) relax the oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle between your oesophagus and your stomach), which allows acid to leak back up.other medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), can affect your digestive tract and cause indigestion.do not take nsaids, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, if you have stomach problems, such as astomach ulcer, or have had this in the past. children under 16 years of age should not take aspirin.never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are told to do so by your gp or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.if you are very overweight, you are more likely to experience indigestion because of increased pressure inside your stomach (abdomen).the increased pressure, particularly after a large meal, may lead to acid reflux into the oesophagus.if you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.read some relaxation tips to relieve stress.a hernia occurs when an internal part of the body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the surrounding muscle or tissue wall.ahiatus herniaoccurs when part of your stomach pushes up into your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under your lungs). it may partially block refluxed stomach acid clearing from your oesophagus, leading to heartburn.helicobacter infection is very common. it may lead to stomach ulcers or, rarely, stomach cancer. in most cases, however, it does not cause any symptoms at all.some people may get bouts of indigestion from helicobacter infection and, in these cases, getting rid of the bug with antibiotics (eradication) will help. however, many cases of indigestion are not caused by helicobacter, and in these cases eradication will not get rid of symptoms.gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord)is a common condition and one of the main causes of recurring indigestion. it’s caused by acid reflux, which occurs when the oesophageal sphincter fails to prevent stomach acid from moving back up into your oesophagus.a little bit of acid reflux is normal and rarely cause any symptoms. it becomes gord when large amounts of reflux occur, and the sensitive lining of your oesophagus may get inflamed by repeated irritation from stomach acid. this can lead to heartburn, the sensation of regurgitation or painful swallowing.astomach ulceris an open sore that develops on the inside lining of your stomach (a gastric ulcer) or small intestine (a duodenal ulcer). if you have a stomach ulcer, you may have indigestion as a symptom.stomach ulcers form when stomach acid damages the lining in your stomach or duodenum wall. in most cases, the lining is damaged as a result of an h pylori infection.in rare cases, recurring bouts of indigestion can be a symptom ofstomach cancer.cancer cells in your stomach break down the protective lining, allowing acid to come into contact with your stomach wall.for most people, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and infrequent, and does not require treatment from a healthcare professional.however, if you have indigestion regularly, or if it causes you severe pain or discomfort, see your pharmacist.they will ask about your indigestion symptoms, as well as: any other symptoms you have – which may indicate an underlying health condition any medication you are taking – as some medications can cause indigestion your lifestyle – as some lifestyle factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol or being overweight, can cause indigestiondepending on the type of indigestion symptoms you have, your pharmacist may recommend you see your gp to investigate your condition further. this is because indigestion can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying condition or health problem, such as a helicobacter pylori (h pylori) bacterial infection.you may be referred to hospital to have an endoscopy.an endoscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of your body using an endoscope – a thin, flexible tube, about the width of your little finger, with a light and a camera on one end. the camera is used to relay images of the inside of your body to a tv monitor.an endoscopy is not often needed to diagnose indigestion, but your gp may suggest that you have one if: they need to examine the inside of your abdomen in more detail you have had treatment for indigestion that has not worked you have anyserious symptoms of indigestiontaking certain medicines for indigestion can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during an endoscopy. therefore, for at least two weeks before your endoscopy, you will need to stop taking proton pump inhibitors (ppis) and h2-receptor antagonists.read more abouttreatments for indigestion.your gp may also recommend changing other medications that may be causing your indigestion. however, only stop taking medication if you are advised to do so by your gp or another healthcare professional responsible for your care.if your gp thinks that your symptoms may be due to an infection with h pylori bacteria, you may need to have a test for it, such as: a stool antigen test – a pea-sized stool (faeces) sample will be tested for h pylori bacteria a breath test ablood test– a blood sample will be tested for antibodies to h pylori bacteria (antibodies are proteins produced by the body to fight infection)antibioticsand ppis can affect the results of a urea breath test or a stool antigen test. therefore, these tests may need to be delayed until two weeks after you last used a ppi, and 4 weeks after you last used an antibiotic.if your gp thinks that your indigestion symptoms may be caused by another underlying medical condition, you may need to have some further tests to rule this out.for example, abdominal pain and discomfort can also be caused by conditions affecting the bile ducts in your liver. your bile ducts are a series of tubes that carry bile (fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) from the liver to the gallbladder (a pouch that holds bile) and the bowel. if your gp thinks that you may have such a condition, they may suggest you have a liver function test, which is a type of blood test used to assess how well your liver is working.you may also need to have an abdominal ultrasound. anultrasound scanuses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body.treatment for indigestion (dyspepsia) will vary, depending on what is causing it and how severe your symptoms are.if you have been diagnosed with an underlying health condition, you may want to read our information on: treating gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) treating a stomach ulcerif you only have indigestion occasionally, you may not need to see your pharmacist or gp for treatment. it may be possible to ease your symptoms by making a few simple changes to your diet and lifestyle, summarised below.being overweight puts more pressure on your stomach, making it easier for stomach acid to be pushed back up into your gullet (oesophagus). this is known as acid reflux, and is one of the most common causes of indigestion.if you are overweight or obese, it is important to lose weight safely and steadily through regular exercise and by eating a healthy, balanced diet. read advice onlosing weight.if you smoke, the chemicals you inhale in cigarette smoke may contribute to your indigestion. these chemicals can cause the ring of muscle that separates your oesophagus from your stomach to relax, causing acid reflux.read more aboutquitting smoking, or speak to your gp or pharmacist. you can also phone thequit your way scotlandservice on 0800 84 84 84.make a note of any particular food or drink that seems to make your indigestion worse, and avoid these if possible. this may mean: eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine – such as tea, coffee and cola avoiding or cutting down on alcoholif you tend to experience indigestion symptoms at night, avoid eating for three to four hours before you go to bed. going to bed with a full stomach means there is an increased risk that acid in your stomach will be forced up into your oesophagus while you are lying down.when you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up or, ideally, raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. the slight slope that is created should help to prevent stomach acid moving up into your oesophagus while you are asleep.if you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.read somerelaxation tips to relieve stress.your pharmacist may recommend making changes to your current medication if they think it could be contributing to your indigestion.as long as it is safe to do so, you may need to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. where required, your pharmacist may advise you see your gp to prescribe an alternative medication that will not cause indigestion. however, never stop taking any medication without consulting your pharmacist or gp first.if you have indigestion that requires immediate relief, your pharmacist can advise you about the best way to treat this. as well as lifestyle changes and reviewing your current medication, your gp may prescribe or recommend: antacid medicines alginatesantacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief for mild to moderate symptoms of indigestion. they work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic), so that it no longer irritates the lining of your digestive system.antacids are available in tablet and liquid form. you can buy them over the counter from most pharmacies without a prescription.the effect of an antacid only lasts for a few hours at a time, so you may need to take more than one dose. always follow the instructions on the packet to ensure you do not take too much.it is best to take antacids when you are expecting symptoms of indigestion, or when they start to occur, such as: after meals at bedtimethis is because antacids stay in your stomach for longer at these times and have more time to work. for example, if you take an antacid at the same time as eating a meal, it can work for up to three hours. in comparison, if you take an antacid on an empty stomach, it may only work for 20 to 60 minutes.read more about antacids, including possible interactions with other medicines and side effects.some antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate. this helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux.acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its lining. alginates form a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents, keeping stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus.your pharmacist may suggest that you take an antacid that contains an alginate if you experience symptoms of acid reflux or if you have gord.take antacids containing alginates after eating, because this helps the medicine stay in your stomach for longer. if you take alginates on an empty stomach, they will leave your stomach too quickly to be effective.if you have indigestion that is persistent or recurring, treatment with antacids and alginates may not be effective enough to control your symptoms. your pharmacist may recommend a different type of medication, which will be prescribed at the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms. possible medications include: proton pump inhibitors (ppis) h2-receptor antagonistsyour pharmacist may advise you to see your gp who may also test you for the helicobacter pylori (h pylori) bacteria (seeindigestion – diagnosis) and prescribe treatment for this if necessary.ppis restrict the acid produced in your stomach.the medication is taken as tablets and if you are over 18, you can buy some types of ppis over the counter in pharmacies, but these should only be used for short-term treatment. ppis may enhance the effect of certain medicines. if you are prescribed a ppi, your progress will be monitored if you are also taking other medicines, such as: warfarin – a medicine that stops the blood clotting phenytoin – a medicine to treat epilepsyif your ingestion is persistent, your pharmacist might advise you to see your gp.if your gp refers you for an endoscopy (a procedure that allows a surgeon to see inside your abdomen), you will need to stop taking a ppi at least 14 days before the procedure. this is because ppis can hide some of the problems that would otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.ppis can sometimes cause side effects. however, they are usually mild and reversible. these side effects may include: headaches diarrhoea constipation feeling sick (nausea) vomiting flatulence stomach pain dizziness skin rashesh2-receptor antagonists are another type of medication that your pharmacist or gp may suggest if antacids, alginates and ppis have not been effective in controlling your indigestion. there are four h2-receptor antagonists: cimetidine famotidine nizatidine ranitidinethese medicines work by lowering the acidity level in your stomach.your gp may prescribe any one of these four h2-receptor antagonists, although ranitidine is available from pharmacies under the pharmacy first scotland service. h2-receptor antagonists are usually taken in tablet form.as with ppis, you will need to stop taking h2-receptor antagonists at least 14 days before having an endoscopy if this has been arranged through your gp. this is because they can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.if your indigestion symptoms are caused by an infection with h pylori bacteria, you will need to have treatment to clear the infection from your stomach. this should help relieve your indigestion, because the h pylori bacteria will no longer be increasing the amount of acid in your stomach.h pylori infection is usually treated using triple therapy (treatment with three different medications). your gp will prescribe a course of treatment containing: two different antibiotics (medicines to treat infections that are caused by bacteria) a ppiyou will need to take these medicines twice a day for seven days. you must follow the dosage instructions closely to ensure that the triple therapy is effective.in up to 85% of cases, one course of triple therapy is effective in clearing an h pylori infection. however, you may need to have more than one course of treatment if it does not clear the infection the first time.in most cases, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and only occurs occasionally. however, severe indigestion can cause complications, some of which are outlined below.indigestion is often caused by acid reflux, which occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your gullet (oesophagus) and irritates its lining. if this irritation builds up over time, it can cause your oesophagus to become scarred. the scarring can eventually lead to your oesophagus becoming narrow and constricted (known as oesophageal stricture).if you have oesophageal stricture, you may have symptoms such as: difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) food that becomes lodged in your throat chest painoesophageal stricture is often treated using surgery to widen your oesophagus.like oesophageal stricture, pyloric stenosis is caused by long-term irritation of the lining of your digestive system from stomach acid.pyloric stenosis occurs when the passage between your stomach and your small intestine (known as the pylorus) becomes scarred and narrowed. this causes vomiting and prevents any food you eat from being properly digested.in most cases, pyloric stenosis is treated using surgery to return the pylorus to its proper width.repeated episodes ofgastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord)can lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. this is a condition known as barrett’s oesophagus.it is estimated that 1 in 10 people with gord will develop barrett’s oesophagus. most cases of barrett’s oesophagus first develop in people aged 50 to 70 years old. the average age at diagnosis is 62.barrett’s oesophagus does not usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those associated with gord.the concern is that barrett’s oesophagus is a pre-cancerous condition. this means that while changes in the cells are not cancerous, there is a small risk they could develop into cancer in the future. this would then trigger the onset ofoesophageal cancer. stomach ulcer nsaids gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord)',\n",

someone has a faulty gene, there’s a 50/50 chance it can be passed on to your children.the effects of these conditions on you and your family can be enormous. these conditions can – in some cases – become life-threatening. around 500 young people die every year in the uk as a result of a genetic heart disorder.these conditions do not always have symptoms, so you can be unaware you have the conditions. sadly, this can sometimes mean that the first time a family is aware of being affected is after a sudden cardiac death (scd).however, great improvements are being made in the detection of iccs and also how you can live with your condition. there are effective treatments which allow you to lead a normal life.it’s very important to draw a medical family tree with an appropriate health

affect around one in every three people in the uk, and is particularly common in elderly people.if you have insomnia, you may: find it difficult to fall asleep lie awake for long periods at night wake up several times during the night wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep not feel refreshed when you get up find it hard to nap during the day, despite feeling tired feel tired and irritable during the day and have difficulty concentratingoccasional episodes of insomnia may come and go without causing any serious problems, but for some people it can last for months or even years at a time.persistent insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life. it can limit what you’re able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues.there are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different.on average, a “normal” amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.what’s important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.you’re probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it’s affecting your everyday life.it’s not always clear what triggers insomnia, but it’s often associated with: stress and anxiety a poor sleeping environment – such as an uncomfortable bed, or a bedroom that’s too light, noisy, hot or cold

general lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise.they will also check your medical history for any illness or medication that may be contributing to your insomnia.your gp may suggest keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks to help them gain a better understanding of your sleep patterns.each day, make a note of things such as the time you went to bed and woke up, how long it took you to fall asleep, and the number of times you woke up during the night.your gp will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems.they’ll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep.in some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) designed for people with insomnia (cbt-i) may be recommended.this is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you avoid the thoughts and behaviours affecting your sleep. it’s usually the first treatment recommended and can help lead to long-term improvement of your sleep.prescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time.this is because

a number of possible factors, including worry and stress, underlying health conditions, and alcohol or drug use.sometimes it’s not possible to identify a clear cause.some people develop insomnia after a stressful event, such as a bereavement, problems at work, or financial difficulties.the problem can continue long after the event has passed because they start to associate going to bed with being awake. this develops into an anxiety about sleep itself.having more general worries – for example, about work, family or health – are also likely to keep you awake at night.these can cause your mind to start racing while you lie in bed, which can be made worse by also worrying about not being able to sleep.you may struggle to get a good night’s sleep if you go to bed at inconsistent times, nap during the day, or don’t “wind down” before going to bed.a poor sleeping environment can also contribute to insomnia – for instance, an uncomfortable bed or a bedroom that’s too bright, noisy, hot or cold.drinking alcohol before going to bed and taking certain recreational drugs can affect your sleep, as can stimulants such as nicotine (found in cigarettes) and caffeine (found in tea, coffee and energy drinks). these should be avoided in the evenings.changes to your sleeping patterns can also contribute to insomnia – for example, because of shift work or changing time zones after a long-haul flight (jet lag).underlying mental health problems can often affect a person’s sleeping patterns, including: mood disorders – such asdepressionorbipolar disorder anxiety disorders– such as generalised

particularly shortly before going to bed. don’t eat a big meal just before bedtime. only go to bed when you’re feeling tired. if necessary, go to bed later than usual if it means you might be able to fall asleep more quickly. don’t use back-lit devices shortly before going to bed, including televisions, phones, tablets and computers. try to create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a bath, listening to soft music, and drinking a warm, milky drink every night. these activities will be associated with sleep and will cause drowsiness. avoid regularly using over-the-counter sleeping tablets. it is not clear how effective these are, they don’t tackle the underlying problem, and have potential side effects. read more abouttreatments for insomnia. don’t lie in bed feeling anxious about lack of sleep. instead, get up, go to another room for about 20 minutes and do something else, such as reading or listening to soft music, before trying again. avoid watching the clock because it will only make you anxious about how long it’s taking you to fall asleep. write a list of your worries and any ideas to solve them before going to bed. this may help you forget about them until the morning. use thick blinds or curtains or wear an eye mask if the early morning sunlight or bright street lamps affect your sleep. make sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature for sleeping. wear ear plugs if noise is a problem. don’t use your bedroom for anything other than sleeping or sex. avoid watching television, making phone calls, eating or working while you’re in bed. make sure

prescription sleeping tablets as a temporary measure.if it’s possible to identify an underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties, treating this may be enough to return your sleep to normal.the various treatments for insomnia are outlined below.your gp will be able to advise you about what you can do at home to help you sleep. this is known as “sleep hygiene” and includes: establishing fixed times for going to bed and waking up creating a relaxing bedtime routine only going to bed when you feel tired maintaining a comfortable sleeping environment that’s not too hot, cold, noisy or bright not napping during the day avoiding caffeine, nicotine and alcohol late at night avoiding eating a heavy meal late at nightread moreabout self-help tips for insomniaif changing your sleeping habits doesn’t help, your gp may be able to refer you for a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) that’s specifically designed for people with insomnia (cbt-i).the aim of cbt-i is to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that may be contributing to your insomnia. it’s an effective treatment for many people and can have long-lasting results.cbt-i may include: stimulus-control therapy – which aims to help you associate the bedroom with sleep and establish a consistent sleep/wake pattern sleep restriction therapy – limiting the amount of time spent in bed to the actual amount of time spent asleep, creating mild sleep deprivation; sleep time is then increased as your sleeping improves relaxation training – aims to reduce tension or minimise intrusive thoughts that may be interfering with sleep paradoxical intention – you try to stay awake and avoid any intention of falling asleep; it’s used if you have trouble getting to sleep, but not maintaining sleep biofeedback – sensors connected to a machine are placed on your body to measure your body’s functions, such as muscle tension and heart rate; the machine produces pictures or sounds to help you recognise when you’re not relaxedcbt-i is sometimes carried out by a specially trained gp. alternatively, you may be referred to a clinical psychologist.the therapy may be carried out in a small group with other people who have similar sleep problems, or one-to-one with a therapist. self-help books and online courses may also be used.sleeping tablets (hypnotics) are medications that encourage sleep. in the past, they were frequently used to help with insomnia, but they’re used much less often nowadays.they will generally only be considered: if your insomnia is severe as a temporary measure to help ease short-term insomnia if the good sleep habits and cognitive and behavioural treatments mentioned above don’t helpdoctors are usually reluctant to recommend sleeping tablets in the long-term because they just mask the symptoms without treating the underlying cause.they can also cause potentially dangerous side effects, such as drowsiness the following morning, and some people become dependent on them.if they are recommended, you should have the smallest effective dose possible for the shortest time (usually no more than two to four weeks).a number of sleeping tablets are available to buy over the counter (otc) from pharmacies. these are usually a type of antihistamine medicine that causes you to feel drowsy.taking otc sleeping tablets regularly isn’t usually recommended if you have insomnia, because it’s not clear how effective they are, they don’t tackle the underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties and they can cause side effects.in particular, they can cause you to feel drowsy the next morning, which can make activities such as driving and operating machinery dangerous.speak to your gp for advice if you find yourself needing to take otc sleeping tablets regularly.benzodiazepines are prescription medicines that can reduce anxiety and promote calmness, relaxation and sleep. your gp may prescribe them for a short time if you have severe insomnia or it’s causing extreme distress.examples of benzodiazepines include temazepam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, diazepam and nitrazepam.long-term treatment with benzodiazepines isn’t usually recommended because they can become less effective over time and some people become dependent upon them.they can also cause a number of side effects, including: drowsiness and dizziness, which can persist into the next day finding it difficult to concentrate or make decisions depression feeling emotionally numb irritabilityyou should avoid driving if you feel drowsy, dizzy, or unable to concentrate or make decisions, as you may not be able to do so safely.z–drugs are a newer type of medicine that work in a similar way to benzodiazepines and are similarly effective. they include zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone.as with benzodiazepines, long-term treatment with z–drugs isn’t normally recommended because they can become less effective over time and some people become dependent on them.they’re usually only prescribed for a maximum of two to four weeks.side effects of z-drugs can include: drowsiness and dizziness, which can persist into the next day feeling and being sick diarrhoea increased snoring and breathing problems during sleep dry mouth confusionz–drugs can also sometimes cause psychiatric reactions, such as delusions, nightmares and hallucinations. contact your gp if you experience any of these effects.read the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) guidance onzaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone for the short-term management of insomniafor more information.for adults aged 55 or over, a medication called circadin is sometimes used to help relieve insomnia for a few weeks. it contains a naturally occurring hormone called melatonin, which helps to regulate the sleep cycle.circadin is usually only recommended for three weeks at first, but it can be continued for a total of 13 weeks if it helps.common side effects of circadin include: headaches cold-like symptoms

cells, which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. if you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won’t get as much oxygen as they usually would.there are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type.other types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin b12 or folate in the body – read more aboutvitamin b12 and folate deficiency anaemia.many people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. the severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anaemia develops.you may notice symptoms immediately, or they may develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as astomach ulcer.the most common symptoms include: tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy) shortness of breath noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations) a pale complexionless common symptoms include: headache hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source(tinnitus) an altered sense of taste feeling itchy a sore or abnormally smooth tongue hair loss a desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica) difficulty

condition using a simpleblood test.read more aboutdiagnosing iron deficiency anaemiathere are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. in men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines.this can be caused by a stomach ulcer,stomach cancer,bowel cancer, or by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids).in women of reproductive age, heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby during pregnancy.unless you’re pregnant, it’s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. however, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you’re more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above.read more about thecauses of iron deficiency anaemiatreatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to boost the low levels of iron in your body. this is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes long-term problems.you’ll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal.the underlying cause will need to be treated so you don’t get anaemia again. increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended.good sources of iron include: dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale iron-fortified cereals or bread brown rice pulses and beans nuts and seeds meat, fish and tofu eggs dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisinsread more abouttreating iron deficiency anaemiaif iron deficiency anaemia is left untreated, it can make you more susceptible to illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects the body’s natural defence system (the immune system).severe iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) orheart failure, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.pregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth.read more about thecomplications of iron deficiency anaemiairon deficiency anaemia occurs when the body doesn’t have enough iron, leading to the decreased production of red blood cells. red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.a lack of iron can be caused by several factors. some of the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia are outlined below.in women of reproductive age, periods are the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia.usually, only women with heavy periods develop iron deficiency anaemia. if you have heavy bleeding over several consecutive menstrual cycles, it’s known as menorrhagia.it’s also very common for women to develop iron deficiency during pregnancy.this is because your body needs extra iron to ensure your baby has a sufficient blood supply and receives necessary oxygen and nutrients.some pregnant women require an iron supplement, while others may need to increase the amount of iron in their diet.read more aboutvitamins and minerals in pregnancythe gastrointestinal tract is the part of the body responsible for digesting food. it contains the stomach and intestines.bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia in men, as well as women who’ve experienced themenopause(when monthly periods stop).most people with gastrointestinal bleeding don’t notice any obvious blood in their stools and don’t experience any changes in their bowel habits.some causes of gastrointestinal bleeding are described below.non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)can cause bleeding in the stomach.ibuprofenandaspirinare two commonly prescribed nsaids.if your gp thinks your medication is causing gastrointestinal bleeding, they can prescribe a less harmful medicine. however, don’t stop taking a medicine you’ve been prescribed unless your gp advises you to.the acid in your stomach, which helps your body digest food, can sometimes eat into your stomach lining. when this happens, the acid forms an open sore (an ulcer). this is also known as astomach ulceror a peptic ulcer.stomach ulcers can cause the stomach lining to bleed, which can lead to anaemia. in some cases, the bleeding can cause you to vomit blood or pass blood in your stools. however, if the ulcer bleeds slowly, you may not have any symptoms.in a few cases, gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by cancer, usuallystomach cancerorbowel cancer.when trying to establish the cause of anaemia, your gp will check for possible signs of cancer.if your gp suspects cancer, you’ll be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in treating digestive conditions) for a more thorough examination. this means that if cancer is found, it can be treated as quickly as possible.if you’re 60 years old or over and have iron deficiency anaemia, your gp should refer you to a specialist to rule out bowel cancer. your  appointment with the specialist should be within two weeks of your gp referring you.gastrointestinal bleeding can also be caused by a condition called angiodysplasia. this is the result of abnormal, fragile superficial blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding.people withchronic kidney disease (ckd)often develop iron deficiency anaemia.most people with ckd who have iron deficiency anaemia will be given iron supplement injections, although daily tablets may be tried first.you can read more abouttreating anaemia in people with ckdon the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) website.other conditions or actions that cause blood loss and may lead to iron deficiency anaemia include: inflammatory bowel disease – a condition that causes redness and swelling (inflammation) in the digestive system, such ascrohn’s diseaseandulcerative colitis oesophagitis – inflammation of the gullet (oesophagus) caused by stomach acid leaking through it schistosomiasis – an infection caused by parasites, mainly found in sub-saharan africa blood donation – donating a large amount of blood may lead to anaemia trauma – a serious accident, such as a car crash, may cause you to lose a large amount of blood nosebleeds– having regular nosebleeds may lead to anaemia, although this is rare haematuria (blood in your urine) – but this rarely causes anaemia and may be a symptom of another conditionmalabsorption is when your body can’t absorb iron from food, and is another possible cause of iron deficiency anaemia.this may happen if you havecoeliac disease, a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten, or surgery to remove all or part of your stomach (gastrectomy).unless you’re pregnant, it’s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused solely by a lack of iron in your diet.however, a lack of dietary iron can increase your risk of developing anaemia if you also have any of the conditions mentioned above.some studies suggest vegetarians or vegans are more at risk of iron deficiency anaemia because of the lack of meat in their diet.if you are vegetarian or vegan, it is possible to gain enough iron by eating other types of food, such as: beans nuts dried fruit, such as dried apricots wholegrains, such as brown rice fortified breakfast cereals soybean flour most dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kaleif you’re pregnant, you may need to increase the amount of iron-rich food you consume during pregnancy to help prevent iron deficiency anaemia.read more aboutvegetarian and vegan dietssee your gp if you experiencesymptoms of iron deficiency anaemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath and heart palpitations.a simple blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis.your gp may also carry out a physical examination and ask you a number of questions to help determine the cause of your anaemia.to diagnose iron deficiency anaemia, a blood sample is taken from a vein in your arm and a full blood count is made. this means all the different types of blood cells in the sample will be measured.if you have anaemia: your levels of haemoglobin – a substance that transports oxygen – will be lower than normal you’ll have fewer red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin, than normal your red blood cells may be smaller and paler than usualyour gp may also test for a substance called ferritin, a protein that stores iron. if your ferritin levels are low, it means there isn’t much iron stored in your body and you may have iron deficiency anaemia.read more aboutblood testsif your gp thinks your anaemia may be the result of a vitamin b12 and folate deficiency, the levels of these substances may be tested. folate works with vitamin b12 to help your body produce red blood cells.vitamin b12 and folate deficiency anaemiais more common in people who are over the age of 75.to determine the underlying cause of your anaemia, your gp may ask questions about your lifestyle and medical history. for example, they may ask you about: your diet – to see what you typically eat and whether this includes any iron-rich foods any medicines you take – to see if you’ve been regularly taking a type of medicine that can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines (gastrointestinal bleeding), such asibuprofenoraspirin your menstrual pattern – if you’re a woman, your gp may ask if you’ve been experiencing particularly heavy periods your family history – you’ll be asked if your immediate family has anaemia or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or blood disordersiron deficiency anaemia is common during pregnancy. if you’re pregnant, your gp will usually only look for an alternative cause if a blood test has identified a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your symptoms or medical history suggest your anaemia may be caused by something else.a physical examination will usually only be needed if the cause of your iron anaemia deficiency hasn’t been identified by examining your medical history and asking you about your symptoms.in such cases, your gp may: examine your stomach (abdomen) to check for any physical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding look for signs ofheart failure, such as swollen ankles – heart failure can have some similar symptoms to iron deficiency anaemiatwo other possible types of physical examination you may have are explained below.a rectal examination is usually only needed if you’re bleeding from your bottom. it’s a common procedure that can help your gp find out if there’s something in your gastrointestinal tract that’s causing bleeding.your gp will insert a lubricated gloved finger into your bottom to feel for any abnormalities.a rectal examination isn’t something to be embarrassed about, as it’s a procedure your gp will be used to doing. it shouldn’t cause significant pain, but it may cause some slight discomfort – this will only last for a minute.women may have a pelvic examination if their gp thinks heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be the cause of their anaemia.during a pelvic examination, your gp will examine your vulva and labia (external sex organs) for signs of bleeding or infection.they may also examine you internally. this will involve your gp inserting lubricated gloved fingers into your vagina to feel whether your womb (uterus) is tender or enlarged.a pelvic examination won’t be carried out without your consent (permission), and you can choose to have someone with you.in some cases, your gp may refer you to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in treating digestive conditions. they’ll carry out a more thorough examination.for example, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist if your gp can’t identify a cause and you have a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your gp thinks there’s a possibility your symptoms could be caused bystomach cancerorbowel cancer, although this is unlikely.if you’re a woman with heavy periods, you may be referred to a gynaecologist if you don’t respond to treatment with iron supplements.treatment for iron deficiency anaemia usually involves taking iron supplements and changing your diet to increase your iron levels, as well as treating the underlying cause.your gp will prescribe an iron supplement to restore the iron missing from your body. the most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate, which is taken as a tablet, usually twice a day.some people can experience side effects when taking iron supplements, including: abdominal (tummy) pain constipationordiarrhoea heartburn feeling sick black stools (faeces)these side effects should settle down over time. however, your gp may recommend taking the tablets with food or shortly after eating if you have troublesome side effects.your gp may also advise you to only take one or two tablets a day, instead of three, if you’re finding side effects difficult to cope with.if you can’t take ferrous sulphate because you get severe side effects, you may be prescribed a different iron supplement called ferrous gluconate.this supplement should cause fewer side effects because it contains a less concentrated dose of iron. however, it may take longer for the iron levels in your body to be restored.in a few cases – for example, if you havechronic kidney disease (ckd)– iron injections may be recommended instead of tablets.as with all medications, it’s important to store iron supplements out of the reach of children. an overdose of iron supplements in a young child can be fatal.if a lack of iron in your diet is thought to be contributing to your iron deficiency anaemia, your gp will tell you how to up your intake.iron-rich foods include: dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale iron-fortified cereals or bread brown rice pulses and beans nuts and seeds white and red meat fish tofu eggs dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisinsyour diet should include foods from all the major food groups to ensure it’s healthy and balanced. in particular, food and drink containing vitamin c are important as vitamin c helps your body absorb iron.however, consuming large amounts of some foods and drinks, as well as certain medicines, may make it harder for your body to absorb iron. these include: tea and coffee calcium – found in dairy products, such as milk antacids and proton pump inhibitors (ppis) – medications used to relieveindigestion wholegrain cereals – although wholegrains are a good source of iron themselves, they contain phytic acid, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and pillsyou may be referred to a nutrition specialist called a dietitian if you’re finding it difficult to include iron in your diet. they’ll be able to give you detailed, personalised advice about how you can improve your diet.your gp will also need to ensure the underlying cause of your anaemia is treated so it doesn’t happen again.for example, if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are causing bleeding in your stomach, your gp may prescribe a different medicine to help minimise the risk of stomach bleeding.heavy periods can be treated with medication or – in particularly severe cases – surgery.your gp will ask you to return two to four weeks after you’ve started taking iron supplements to check how well you’ve responded to the treatment. you’ll have ablood testto check your haemoglobin levels.if your blood test results show an improvement, you’ll be asked to continue taking iron supplements and return in two to four months for another blood test.once your haemoglobin levels and red blood cells are normal, your gp will usually recommend continuing to take iron supplements for three months to help build up the iron levels in your body.after this, you should be able to stop taking the supplements, depending on the cause of your iron deficiency anaemia. your condition will be monitored every three months over the course of a year, and again a year later.sometimes after a person’s iron levels have been replenished, they start to fall again.this could happen if you don’t get enough iron in your diet, you’re pregnant, or you have consistently heavy periods.in such cases, you may be prescribed an ongoing iron supplement to help stop your anaemia returning. this will usually be a tablet, which you’ll have to take once a day.if your iron levels don’t improve, your gp will ask how regularly you’ve been taking your iron supplements.some people are put off taking the medication because of the side effects. however, your condition won’t improve if you don’t take the supplements.if you’ve been taking the supplements as prescribed and your iron levels still haven’t improved, your gp may refer you to a specialist for an assessment.iron deficiency anaemia rarely causes serious or long-term complications, although some people with the condition find it affects their daily life.some common complications are outlined below.iron deficiency anaemia can make you feel tired and lacking in energy (lethargic). this may result in you being less productive at work, and you may find it difficult to stay awake or not feel able to exercise regularly.research has shown iron deficiency anaemia can affect your immune system – the body’s natural defence system. this increases your vulnerability to infection.adults with severe anaemia may be at risk of developing complications that affect their heart or lungs.for example, you may developtachycardia, which is an abnormally fast heartbeat, orheart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.pregnant women with severe anaemia have an increased risk of developing complications, particularly during and after birth.they may also developpostnatal depression, which some women experience after having a baby.research suggests babies born to mothers who have untreated anaemia are more likely to: be born prematurely – before the 37th week of pregnancy have a low birth weight have problems with iron levels themselves do less well in mental ability testssome cases ofrestless legs syndromeare thought to be caused by iron deficiency anaemia. doctors often refer to this as secondary restless legs syndrome.restless legs syndrome is a common condition that affects the nervous system, and causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs. it also causes an unpleasant feeling in the feet, calves and thighs.restless legs syndrome caused by iron deficiency anaemia can usually be treated with iron supplements. vitamin b12 or folate deficiency anaemia

severehivinfection. it can also affect some people who have a weakened immune system for another reason, as well as people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus.the most common initial symptom is the appearance of small, painless, flat and discoloured patches on the skin or inside the mouth. they’re usually red or purple and look similar to bruises.over time, the patches may grow into lumps known as nodules and may merge into each other.internal organs can also be affected, including the lymph nodes, lungs and the digestive system, which can cause symptoms such as:the rate at which symptoms progress depends on the type of kaposi’s sarcoma you have. most types get worse quickly in a matter of weeks or months without treatment, but some progress very slowly over many years.you should speak to your gp if you have any worrying symptoms you think could be caused by kaposi’s sarcoma. if you have hiv, you can also contact your local hiv clinic if you have any concerns.your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your skin to look for the characteristic discoloured patches. if they suspect kaposi’s sarcoma, they will refer you for further tests to confirm the diagnosis.these tests may include: an hiv test – a blood test to confirm whether or not you have hiv (if you haven’t already been diagnosed with the condition) a skinbiopsy– where a small sample of cells is removed from an affected area of skin and checked for kaposi’s sarcoma cells an endoscopy – where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat to see if your lungs or digestive system are affected acomputerised tomography (ct) scanto see if your lymph nodes or other parts of your body are affectedkaposi’s sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8), also known as the kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv). this virus is thought to be spread during sex, through saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth.hhv-8 is a relatively common virus and the vast majority of people who have it will not develop kaposi’s sarcoma. it only seems to cause cancer in some people with a weakened immune system and in some people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus.a weakened immune system allows the hhv-8 virus to multiply to high levels in the blood, which increases the chance it will cause kaposi’s sarcoma.the virus appears to alter the genetic instructions that control cell growth. this means some cells reproduce uncontrollably and form lumps of tissue known as tumours.there are 4 main types of kaposi’s sarcoma. these types affect different groups of people and are treated in different ways.although it’s not as common as it used to be, kaposi’s sarcoma is still one of the main types of cancer to affect people with hiv.hiv-related kaposi’s sarcoma can progress very quickly if not treated. however, it can usually be controlled by taking hiv medication – known as combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) – to prevent hiv multiplying and allow the immune system to recover. the immune system can then reduce the levels of hhv-8 in the body.read more abouttreating hiv.some people may also require treatment withradiotherapy(where high-energy rays are used to destroy cancer cells) orchemotherapy(where powerful medications are used to destroy cancer cells), depending on the site and extent of the cancer and what symptoms it’s causing.classic kaposi’s sarcoma mainly affects middle-aged and elderly men of mediterranean or ashkenazi jewish descent. ashkenazi jews are descended from jewish communities that lived in central and eastern europe. most jewish people in the uk are ashkenazi jews.it’s thought people who develop classic kaposi’s sarcoma were born with a genetic vulnerability to the hhv-8 virus.unlike the other types of kaposi’s sarcoma, the symptoms of classic kaposi’s sarcoma progress very slowly over many years and are usually limited to the skin.immediate treatment isn’t usually required because, in many cases, the condition doesn’t affect life expectancy. you’ll usually be monitored carefully and only treated if the symptoms get significantly worse.radiotherapy is often used if treatment is required, although small skin patches or nodules may be removed using minor surgery or cryotherapy (freezing).transplant-related kaposi’s sarcoma is a rare complication of an organ transplant. it occurs because the immunosuppressant medication used to weaken the immune system and help prevent the body rejecting the new organ can allow a previous hhv-8 infection to reactivate, which means levels of the virus increase as it starts multiplying again.transplant-related kaposi’s sarcoma can be aggressive and usually needs to be treated quickly. it’s normally treated by reducing or stopping the immunosuppressants, if this is possible. if this is unsuccessful, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used.endemic african kaposi’s sarcoma is common in parts of africa and is one of the most widespread types of cancer in that region.although this type of kaposi’s sarcoma is classified separately from hiv-related kaposi’s sarcoma, many cases may actually result from an undiagnosed hiv infection. all suspected cases therefore must have an hiv test, as the most effective treatment in these cases is hiv medication.in cases not caused by hiv infection, this type of kaposi’s sarcoma may be the result of a genetic vulnerability to hhv-8. these cases are usually treated with chemotherapy, although sometimes radiotherapy may be used.with proper treatment, kaposi’s sarcoma can usually be controlled for many years. deaths from the condition are uncommon in the uk.the discoloured patches of skin will often shrink and fade with treatment, although they may not ever disappear completely.a complete cure for any type of kaposi’s sarcoma isn’t always possible, and there’s a chance the condition could recur in the future. if you think this is happening, contact your hiv

thesymptoms of kidney canceranddiagnosing kidney cancer.the kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just underneath the ribcage.their main role is to filter out waste products from the blood, in addition to producing urine. only 1 of the kidneys is usually affected by cancer.the human body is made up of billions of cells, which normally grow and multiply in an orderly way, with new cells being created only when and where they’re needed. in cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.exactly what triggers this growth is unknown. however, there are certain risk factors that can increase the chances of the condition developing, such assmokingandobesity.kidney cancer most frequently affects people over 50 years of age and is more common among men.read more about thecauses of kidney cancer.many different types of cancer can affect the kidneys. the most common type is renal cell carcinoma (rcc), which

course of action.unlike most other cancers,chemotherapyisn’t very effective at treating kidney cancer. however, non-surgical treatments are available, such asradiotherapyor targeted therapies. these are most commonly used in the more advanced stages of kidney cancer, when the cancer has spread beyond the kidney.read more abouttreating kidney cancer.as the causes of kidney cancer aren’t fully understood, it’s not possible to fully prevent it.however, leading a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of developing the condition. a combination of ahealthy dietandregular exercisewill help to

with a calorie-controlled diet.read more abouttreating obesity.most cases of kidney cancer don’t cause any symptoms in the early stages.the most common symptoms of mid- to advanced-stage kidney cancer are: blood in your urine (haematuria) – the amount of blood is usually high enough to change the colour of your urine to a reddish or dark brown colour a persistent pain in your side, just below the ribs a lump or swelling in the area of your kidneys (on either side of the body)however, in around half of all cases, the cancer causes no symptoms and is only detected during a routineultrasound

unwell swelling of the veins in the testicles (in men) loss of appetite high blood pressure (hypertension)speak to your gp immediately if you have pain or a swelling or lump in your kidney area (on either side of your body, just below your ribcage).you should also speak to your gp if you have blood in your urine. although it’s highly unlikely to be caused by kidney cancer, it could be a symptom of a less serious condition that still requires treatment, such as akidney stoneor bladder stone.the exact cause of kidney cancer is unknown, but there are risk factors that can increase the chances of developing the condition.the 3 main risk factors for kidney cancer are: obesity smoking family history and geneticsobesity is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.there’s a strong link between someone’s body mass index (bmi) and their risk of developing kidney cancer. read more abouthow bmi is calculated, and work out your bmi.a bmi score of 25 or above has been shown to increase a person’s chances of developing kidney cancer. those with a bmi score of 30 or above are at particularly high risk.this may be because overweight or obese people, particularly women, have higher levels of a hormone called oestrogen in their body. it’s thought that excess levels of oestrogen may stimulate the growth of cancerous cells.cases of kidney cancer have been increasing over the last 40 years, which has been linked to rising obesity levels.smoking is also a significant risk factor for developing kidney cancer, and the more you smoke the greater the risk.for example, research has shown that if you regularly smoke 10 cigarettes a day, you’re one-and-a-half times more likely to develop kidney cancer compared to a non-smoker. this increases to twice as likely if you smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day.it’s not clear why smoking increases your chances of developing kidney cancer.if you have a close family member (parents, brothers, sisters or a child) who’s been diagnosed with kidney cancer, you’re about twice as likely to develop kidney cancer yourself.examples of inherited genetic conditions and syndromes that increase your risk of developing kidney cancer include: tuberous sclerosis – a rare genetic condition that causes multiple non-cancerous (benign) tumours to grow in the body; it’s autosomal dominant, which means you only have to inherit the faulty gene from one parent to get it; about 1 in every 100 people with tuberous sclerosis will develop kidney cancer hereditary papillary kidney cancer – a rare form of cancer caused by faulty genes inherited from your parents; it’s autosomal dominant and causes small, slow-growing, cancerous tumours to develop in the kidneys, which can sometimes spread hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (hlrcc) – a rare, autosomal dominant form of cancer, where cancerous tumours develop from smooth muscle tissue (leiomyomatas); people with hlrcc have a 10 to 16% increased risk of developing kidney cancer von hippel-lindau syndrome – a rare genetic syndrome that causes small non-cancerous tumours to develop inside the nervous system; vhl is also autosomal dominant and about 4 out of 10 people who have it develop kidney cancer birt-hogg-dubé syndrome – an inherited syndrome that causes non-cancerous tumours to develop in the hair follicles of the skin; they usually occur on the face, neck and torsothere are also a number of other possible risk factors for developing kidney cancer, including: mild painkillers – some mild painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of developing kidney cancer;nsaids, such asibuprofen, may slightly increase the risk, although occasional use or low doses are unlikely to be harmful kidney disease– if you have kidney failure and need to have regulardialysis(treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys), your risk of developing kidney cysts and kidney cancer is increased high blood pressure (hypertension)– high blood pressure is a known risk factor for kidney disease, and you’re up to twice as likely to develop kidney cancer if you have raised blood pressurein many cases, kidney cancer is diagnosed after routine scans and check-ups, as the condition doesn’t always have obvious symptoms.you should speak to your gp if you have any symptoms of kidney cancer, such as blood in your urine or a constant pain below your ribs.your gp will examine you and, if they think your symptoms need further assessment, refer you to a specialist urologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the urinary tract).if you notice blood in your urine, your gp will usually carry out ablood testand take a urine sample. the results will help rule out other possible causes, such as infection orkidney stones.in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of renal (kidney) cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected kidney cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.if you need to be referred urgently, you’ll usually be seen within 2 weeks.if your gp refers you to a hospital specialist, further tests will help determine whether you have kidney cancer.anultrasound scanuses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of an organ in the body. it can often detect changes in the shape of the kidney that might be caused by a cancerous tumour.an ultrasound scan may be needed if the cause of the blood in your urine can’t be found.you may also be referred for acomputerised tomography (ct) scan. during a ct scan, a series of detailed images of the inside of your body are taken and put together by a computer.if you have a ct scan, you may be given a special dye to drink, or it may be injected. the dye makes the results of the ct scan clearer.in some cases of kidney cancer, an image-guidedbiopsyis carried out. it’s a minor surgical procedure performed underlocal anaesthetic. this means you’ll be awake during the procedure, but the area surrounding the affected kidney will be numbed, so that you don’t feel anything.during an image-guided biopsy, a radiologist or surgeon will use an ultrasound or ct scan to guide a needle through your skin and into your kidney. a small tissue sample will be removed from your kidney and examined under a microscope to check for cancerous cells.you may also need to have amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan, which can be used to produce detailed images of your kidneys. the images can help identify a tumour and determine its size.a cystoscopy is a medical procedure that uses an instrument called a cystoscope to examine the inside of your bladder and urinary system.this procedure doesn’t look at the kidneys, but it can rule out or confirm whether any bleeding is coming from problems in the bladder.an intravenous pyelogram (ivp) test involves injecting a dye into your bloodstream.x-raysare taken after a short time, with the dye highlighting any growths present in the kidneys.if kidney cancer is confirmed, it’s usually possible to determine its grade and stage.the stage describes how far the cancer has spread, and the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how quickly it’s likely to spread.both the stage and grade of your kidney cancer will help determine your recommended treatment and the likelihood of achieving a cure.healthcare professionals use the tnm system to stage kidney cancer: t – indicates how large the tumour has grown (a tumour is a lump of cancerous tissue) n – indicates whether nearby lymph nodes are affected (lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped glands found throughout the body, which help protect against infection) m – indicates whether the cancer has spread to another part of the body (m stands for metastases, which is the medical term for cancer that has spread)the stages of tumour size are: t1a – where the tumour is less than 4cm (about 1.6 inches) in diameter t1b – where the tumour is 4 to 7cm (about 1.6-2.8 inches) in diameter t2 – where the tumour is larger than 7cm (2.8 inches) in diameter, but hasn’t spread out of the kidney t3a – where the tumour has spread into the adrenal gland or the layer of fat surrounding the kidney t3b – where the tumour has spread into the renal vein (the vein that carries blood back from the kidney to the heart) or into the vena cava (the vein that carries blood back from the top half of the body) t3c – where the tumour has spread past the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that separates the top part of the abdomen from the bottom part) t4 – where the tumour has spread beyond the tough layer of tissue that surrounds and protects the kidneythere are 3 lymph node stages: n0 – where no lymph nodes have been affected n1 – where there are cancer cells in 1 lymph node n2 – where there are cancer cells in 2 or more lymph nodesm0 means that the cancer hasn’t spread to another part of the body. m1 means that the cancer has spread.kidney cancer is graded using a scale of one to four. the higher the grade, the more aggressive the cancer.being diagnosed with cancer can be very distressing, particularly if it’s incurable. the news can often be difficult to take in and comprehend.after cancer has been diagnosed, you may find that talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist helps you deal with feelings ofdepressionandanxiety.antidepressantsmay also be used to help you through this process.read more aboutcoping with a cancer diagnosis. more information can be found on our pages aboutliving with cancer.the treatment of kidney cancer depends on the size and spread of the cancer. surgery is the most common first course of action, with the aim of removing the cancer cells.unlike most other cancers, chemotherapy isn’t very effective in treating kidney cancer. however, there are non-surgical treatments available, such as radiotherapy or targeted drug therapies.the main treatments for kidney cancer include: nephrectomy embolisation radiotherapy targeted therapies immunotherapyyou can expect to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team, often comprising a specialist cancer surgeon, an oncologist (who specialises in radiotherapy andchemotherapy), a radiologist, a nephrologist (a kidney specialist) and a specialist nurse.you’ll be given a key worker, usually the specialist nurse, who will be responsible for coordinating your care.your team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.when deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider: thestage and grade of your cancer(how big it is and how far it’s spread) your age and general healthif the cancer hasn’t spread out of your kidney (t1 or t2 kidney cancer), it can usually be cured by removing some or all of the kidney.if the cancer has spread out of your kidney (t3 or t4 kidney cancer), a complete cure may not be possible. however, it should be possible to slow the cancer’s progression and treat any symptoms.a nephrectomy is an operation to remove a kidney.if the tumour is less than 4cm (1.5 inches) in diameter, it may only be necessary to remove some of your kidney. this is known as a partial nephrectomy. a partial nephrectomy may also be required if your remaining kidney is in poor health.if the tumour is more than 4cm in diameter, your entire kidney will need to be removed. even if the cancer has spread beyond your kidney, you may still benefit from having your kidney removed.removing the kidney can help resolve the pain, and make other types of non-surgical treatment more effective.it’s possible to live a normal life with only 1 kidney, because the other kidney will be able to compensate.during a nephrectomy, the surgeon may also remove nearby lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread beyond the kidney.there are 2 ways that both a partial and open nephrectomy can be performed they are an: open nephrectomy – where the kidney is removed through a large incision in your abdomen (stomach) laparoscopic or keyhole nephrectomy – where a series of smaller incisions are made in your abdomen, and the kidney is removed using small surgical instrumentsboth techniques have advantages and disadvantages.a laparoscopic nephrectomy has a considerably quicker recovery time than an open nephrectomy.however, the procedure requires surgeons with specialised training, so you may have to wait longer to receive treatment than you would if you decided to have an open nephrectomy.some types of kidney cancer, where the tumour is located in the centre of the kidney, may not be suitable for a laparoscopic nephrectomy.one of the main disadvantages of an open nephrectomy is that it’s a major surgical procedure that can place a considerable strain on the body. this means it may not be suitable for people who are particularly frail or unwell.you should discuss the pros and cons of both procedures with your surgical team.if you’re unable to have a nephrectomy, you may benefit from an alternative operation known as embolisation.during embolisation, the surgeon will insert a small tube called a catheter into your groin, then usex-rayimages to guide the catheter into the blood supply of your kidney. a substance will then be injected through the catheter to block the blood supply to your kidney.by blocking blood supply to the kidney, any tumours that are present will become starved of oxygen and nutrients, causing them to shrink.kidney cancer is one of the few types of cancer that’s less responsive tochemotherapy(where powerful medication is used to kill cancerous cells).however, a number of clinical trials are underway that are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medications that appear to be benefiting some people.there are also a number of different non-surgical treatments that can slow the spread of the cancer and help control its symptoms.radiotherapycan’t usually cure kidney cancer, but it can slow down its progress and help reduce pain. you should only need a few minutes of radiotherapy every day, for a number of days.when radiotherapy is used to control the symptoms of cancer rather than cure it, the side effects tend to be mild. possible side effects may include fatigue (tiredness), nausea and vomiting.cryotherapy involves killing cancer cells by freezing them. it may be used if a person isn’t fit enough for surgery, or if their tumour is small.cryotherapy is usually classed as either percutaneous (where needles are passed through the skin) or laparoscopic (where needles are placed directly into the kidney through a small incision).side effects include bleeding around the kidney and injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).radiofrequency ablation (rfa) uses heat generated by radio waves to kill cancer cells. this is a percutaneous treatment, meaning no incision is needed.this treatment is only available at specialist centres. it’s mainly used if you’re not strong enough for surgery or your kidney cancer is in the early stages.rfa can’t be used if the cancer is too close to other organs, such as the bowel.side effects include bleeding in the treatment area, a collection of blood (haematoma) near the kidney, and problems passing urine due to the narrowing of the tube that joins the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).a number of new medicines have been developed for the treatment of kidney cancer. these are: sunitinib pazopanib axitinib sorafenib temsirolimus everolimus bevacizumabthese medicines are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they’re designed to target and interrupt the functions needed by cancer to grow and spread.at present, only sunitinib, pazopanib and axitinib have been recommended by thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice). they’re available on the nhs for people who are still relatively healthy and have advanced kidney cancer, or kidney cancer that’s spread to other parts of their body.sorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus and bevacizumab aren’t currently recommended by nice.sunitinib is the most commonly prescribed treatment for kidney cancer. it’s a type of medication known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. tyrosine kinase is an enzyme (protein) that helps cancer cells to grow. sunitinib works by blocking protein kinase, stopping cancer from growing.sunitinib is taken as a capsule with or without food. you take it once a day for 4 weeks before having a 2-week break. this 6-week cycle is repeated for as long as the treatment is effective.it’s very important that you take sunitinib in the exact dosage that’s been prescribed for you. never stop taking medication for cancer without first consulting your specialist.common side effects of sunitinib include: nausea diarrhoea high blood pressure (hypertension) hair discolouration mouth soreness skin discolouration skin rashes or blistersthecancer research ukwebsite has more information aboutsunitinib and its side effects.like sunitinib, pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used to slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells in the kidneys. it also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels, which they need to grow.pazopanib is taken as a tablet once a day with a glass of water. you should take it about the same time each day, either at least an hour before eating or 2 hours afterwards. it’s important that you take it in the exact dosage that your specialist has prescribed for you.common side effects of pazopanib include: nausea diarrhoea high blood pressure hair discolouration abnormal liver functionthe cancer research uk website has more information aboutpazopanib.axitinib may be recommended for treating advanced kidney cancer if sunitinib and/or pazopanib have stopped working or haven’t been effective.like sunitinib and pazopanib, axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tyrosine kinase and stops cancer growing.axitinib is taken as a tablet with a glass of water twice a day, about 12 hours apart. your specialist may start you on a low dose which, depending on how you feel, may be increased after 2 weeks. it’s very important that you take the exact dose that’s been prescribed for you.common side effects of axitinib include: diarrhoea nausea and vomiting loss of appetite tiredness a decrease in thyroid hormone level (hypothyroidism) headaches weight loss loss of fertilitythe cancer research uk website has more information aboutaxitinib.sorafenib is another tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the protein, tyrosine kinase, which encourages cancer cells to grow. it also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels which they need to grow.sorafenib is taken as a tablet twice a day (at the same time each day) with a glass of water. it can also be taken with a meal, but make sure the food is low-fat, because high-fat foods make it less effective.again, it’s very important that you take sorafenib as instructed by your doctor at the exact dosage prescribed for you.common side effects of sorafenib include: diarrhoea fatigue nausea and vomiting hair thinning (in around one in four people) increased risk of bleeding – such asnosebleedsor bleeding gums loss of fertility flushed skinthe cancer research uk website has more information aboutsorafenib.temsirolimus is sometimes used to treat advanced kidney cancer. it’s a type of medication known as an mtor inhibitor, which blocks a protein called mtor, that’s usually active in cancer cells, making them reproduce and multiply. temsirolimus also prevents blood vessels from developing, which cancer cells need to grow.temsirolimus is a liquid that’s delivered directly into the bloodstream, either through a tube that’s put into a vein in your arm (catheter), or a tube into a large vein in your chest (a central line). the treatment takes 30 to 60 minutes and you have it once a week in hospital. before each dose, an antihistamine is usually given to prevent an allergic reaction.common side effects of temsirolimus include: red, dry, itchy skin nausea and vomiting lack of appetite diarrhoea a sore mouth ormouth ulcers sleeping problems loss of fertilityeverolimus is a medication for advanced kidney cancer that’s returned during or following treatment. it stops some of the signals produced within cells that make them grow and divide. everolimus prevents the mtor protein from working properly, which plays an important role in the growth of cancer cells.everolimus is taken as a tablet once a day at the same time each day. it should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, rather than being chewed or crushed. it can be taken with or without food. it’s very important that everolimus is taken using the exact dosage and method prescribed.common side effects of everolimus include: a sore mouth tiredness a rash or itchy, dry skin loss of appetite nausea and vomiting a lack of periods in women (this may be temporary) loss of fertilitythe cancer research uk website has more information abouteverolimus.as well as medications that prevent, disrupt and slow down the growth and development of kidney cancer (kinase and mtor inhibitors), there are also treatments that work by encouraging the immune system to attack cancer cells. this type of treatment is known as immunotherapy.bevacizumab is a medication that’s given intravenously (into a vein, through a drip). it blocks a protein called endothelial growth factor (vegf), which helps cancer to grow. bevacizumab is usually used in combination with an immunotherapy treatment called interferon. interferon is taken as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously), three times a week. it encourages your immune system to attack and destroy the cancer cells.another medication called aldesleukin is sometimes used to treat kidney cancer that’s spread. it’s similar to a natural protein the body produces called interleukin-2 (il-2), which is part of the immune system. il-2 activates lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), which fight illnesses and infections.aldesleukin works in a number of ways. it interferes with how cancer cells grow and multiply, it stimulates the immune system into attacking cancer cells, and it makes cancer cells send out chemicals that attract immune system cells. like interferon, aldesleukin is usually given as a subcutaneous injection.immunotherapy treatments are now rarely used to treat advanced kidney cancer. this is because targeted therapies tend to be more effective in controlling the condition, and immunotherapy can sometimes cause serious side effects.the cancer research

       " 'Kidney infection': 'a kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a painful and unpleasant illness caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of your kidneys.it’s more serious thancystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful.if treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn’t cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. if a kidney infection isn’t treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage.symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. you can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side.read more about thesymptoms of a kidney infectionsee your gp if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination.most kidney infections need prompt treatment withantibioticsto stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. you may also need painkillers.if you’re especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection, for example, if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant, you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through an intravenous drip.after taking antibiotics, you should feel completely better after about 2 weeks.in rare cases, a kidney infection can cause further problems. these include blood poisoning (sepsis) and a build-up of pus in the kidney called an abscess.read more abouttreating a kidney infectionand thecomplications of a kidney infectiona kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called e. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys.read more about thecauses of a kidney infectionkidney infections are relatively rare. it’s estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the uk.they can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. in fact, women are 6 times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. this is because a woman’s urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection.younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys.you can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. this can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation.read more aboutpreventing a kidney infectionthe symptoms of a kidney infection usually develop quite quickly over a few hours or days.common symptoms include: pain and discomfort in your side, lower back or around your genitals high temperature (it may reach 39.5c or 103.1f) shivering or chills feeling very weak or tired loss of appetite feeling sick or being sick diarrhoeayou may have other symptoms if you also havecystitisor urethritis (an infection of the urethra). these additional symptoms may include: pain or a burning sensation during urination need to urinate frequently or urgently feeling that you’re unable to urinate fully blood in your urine cloudy or foul smelling urine pain in your lower abdomenchildren with a kidney infection may also have additional symptoms, such as: a lack of energy irritability poor feeding and/or vomiting not growing at the expected rate abdominal pain jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) blood in the urine unpleasant smelling urine bedwettingcontact your gp if you have a high temperature, persistent pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. contact your gp immediately if you think your child may have a kidney infection.if you have blood in your urine, you should always see your gp so the cause can be investigated.kidney infections require prompt treatment withantibioticsto help relieve symptoms and preventcomplications developing.your gp can carry out some simple tests to help diagnose a kidney infection.seediagnosing kidney infectionsfor more informationa kidney infection happens when bacteria infects your kidneys. the bacteria are usually a type called e. coli, which live in your bowel.the bacteria get in through the opening of the urethra and move upwards through your urinary tract, first infecting your bladder and then your kidneys.it’s thought the bacteria can get into your urinary tract by accidentally spreading from your anus to your urethra. this can happen if you wipe your bottom after going to the toilet and the soiled toilet paper comes into contact with your genitals. it can also happen during sex.in rare cases, a kidney infection can develop if bacteria or fungi infect the skin and the infection spreads through your bloodstream into your kidney. however, this type of infection usually only occurs in people with weakened immune systems.women and children are most at risk of developing a kidney infection, as well as other urinary tract infections (utis) such ascystitis.in women, the urethra is closer to the anus than in men, making it easier for bacteria from the anus to enter the urethra accidentally. the female urethra is also much shorter than the male urethra (which runs through the penis). this makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and move into the kidneys.other factors can also put you more at risk of developing a kidney infection, including: having a condition that blocks, or obstructs, your urinary tract, such askidney stonesor anenlarged prostate– children withconstipationcan also be at an increased risk being born with an abnormality in your urinary tract having a condition that prevents you emptying your bladder fully, such as an injury to your spinal cord – this can allow bacteria in your bladder to multiply and spread having a weakened immune system – for example, due totype 2 diabetesor as a side effect ofchemotherapy having an infection of the prostate gland called prostatitis – the infection can spread from the prostate gland into the kidneys having a urinary catheter (a thin, flexible tube inserted into your bladder to drain away urine) being female and sexually active – sexual intercourse can irritate the urethra and allow bacteria to travel into your bladder being a man who has anal sex – bacteria can travel up the urethra into the bladder being pregnant – this can cause physical changes that slow the flow of urine out of your body and make it easier for bacteria to spread to the kidneys having undergone female genital mutilation (fgm) – an illegal practice where a woman’s genitals are deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasonsto work out if you have a kidney infection, your gp will ask you about your symptoms and your recent medical history.they will usually also assess your general health by taking your temperature and measuring your blood pressure.a urine test can help to establish whether you have aurinary tract infection (uti). the test involves taking a small sample of urine and checking it to see if there are any bacteria in it.you’ll be given a container and told how to collect the urine, which you can do in the surgery or at home. if you do it at home, you’ll need to label the container, seal it in a plastic bag and store it in the fridge. ideally, hand it in to the surgery within four hours.a urine test can’t tell whether the infection – if you have one – is in your kidneys or another part of your urinary system, such as your bladder.for your gp to be confident you have a kidney infection, you need to have a positive urine test plus certain symptoms, such as a fever or a pain in your side.you may be referred to hospital for further testing if: your symptoms fail to respond to treatment with antibiotics your symptoms suddenly get worse you have additional symptoms that aren’t usually associated with a kidney infection you’re at risk ofcomplications of a kidney infectionchildren with recurrent utiswill also be referred to hospital for further testing.in these circumstances, scans can check your urinary tract for signs of problems. this may include: acomputer tomography (ct) scan– where a scanner takes a series of x-rays and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed image of your urinary tract anultrasound scan– which uses sound waves to build an image of the inside of your body an isotope scan – where a dye is injected into the bloodstream and a series ofx-raysare takenread more abouttreating a kidney infectionmost people with a kidney infection can be treated at home with a course of antibiotics, and possibly painkillers as well.see your gp if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination.all children with symptoms of aurinary tract infection (uti)or kidney infection, includingcystitis, should see their gp or out-of-hours emergency service.if you’re being treated at home, you’ll usually be prescribed a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules that lasts between 7 and 14 days.for most people – apart from pregnant women – antibiotics called ciprofloxacin or co-amoxiclav are recommended. however, other antibiotics may also be used.common side effects of ciprofloxacin include feeling sick anddiarrhoea.co-amoxiclav can make thecontraceptive pillandcontraceptive patchesless effective, so you may need to use another form of contraception during the course of treatment.a 14-day course of an antibiotic called cefalexin is recommended for pregnant women.usually, you’ll start to feel better quite soon after treatment starts and you should feel completely better after about 2 weeks.if your symptoms show no sign of improvement 24 hours after treatment starts, contact your gp for advice.taking a painkiller such asparacetamolshould help relieve symptoms of pain and a high temperature.however,non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (nsaids)such asibuprofenaren’t usually recommended to relieve pain during a kidney infection. this is because they may increase the risk of further kidney problems.if you have a kidney infection, try not to ‘hover’ over the toilet seat when you go to the loo, because it can result in your bladder not being fully emptied.it’s also important to drink plenty of fluids, because this will help preventdehydrationand will help to flush out the bacteria from your kidneys. aim to drink enough so that you’re frequently passing pale-coloured urine.make sure that you get plenty of rest. a kidney infection can be physically draining, even if you’re normally healthy and strong. it may take up to two weeks before you’re fit enough to return to work.your gp may refer you to hospital if you have an underlying problem with your urinary tract, which makes you vulnerable to kidney infections.it’s standard practice to further investigate all men with a kidney infection simply because the condition is much rarer in men. only women who have had 2 or more kidney infections tend to be referred. most children with a kidney infection will be treated in hospital.hospital treatment may also be needed if: you’reseverely dehydrated you’reunable to swallowor keep down any fluids or medications you have additional symptoms that suggest you may haveblood poisoning, such as a rapid heartbeat and losing consciousness you’re pregnant and you also have a high temperature you’re particularly frail and your general health is poor your symptoms fail to improve within 24 hours of starting treatment with antibiotics you have a weakened immune system you have a foreign body inside your urinary tract, such as akidney stoneor aurinary catheter you have diabetes you’re over the age of 65 you have an underlying condition that affects the way your kidneys work, such as polycystic kidney disease orchronic kidney diseaseif you’re admitted to hospital with a kidney infection, you’ll probably be attached to a drip so you can be given fluids to help keep you hydrated. antibiotics can also be given through the drip.you’ll have regular blood and urine tests to monitor your health and how effectively the antibiotics are fighting off the infection.most people respond well to treatment. as long as there are no complications, they’re usually well enough to leave hospital within three to seven days. treatment will usually switch to tablets or capsules after you stop receiving antibiotics through a drip.most kidney infections are treated successfully without complications, although some people may develop further problems.complications of a kidney infection are rare, but you’re more likely to develop them if you: are a child are over 65 are pregnant havediabetes,chronic kidney diseaseorsickle cell anaemia have had akidney transplant(particularly in the first three months after the transplant) have a weakened immune system developed the kidney infection while in hospitala kidney abscess is a rare, but serious, complication of a kidney infection, where pus develops inside the tissue of the kidney.you’re thought to be most at risk of developing a kidney abscess if you havediabetes.the symptoms of a kidney abscess are similar to those of a kidney infection. the most common are: a high temperature of 38c (100.4f) or above chills abdominal pain loss of appetite pain when passing urinekidney abscesses are potentially serious because the bacteria inside the abscess can spread to other parts of your body, such as your bloodstream or lungs, and can be fatal.smaller abscesses can usually be treated with antibiotics through a drip. surgery is usually required for larger abscesses. this involves draining the pus out of the abscess using a needle that’s inserted into the kidney.blood poisoning (also called sepsis)is another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection. it happens when bacteria spreads from the kidneys into the bloodstream. once bacteria are in your blood, the infection can spread to any part of your body, including all of the major organs.in someone with a kidney infection, the symptoms of blood poisoning include: low blood pressure, which makes you feel dizzy when you stand up confusion or disorientation excessive sweating uncontrollable shaking or shivering high temperature or lower body temperature than usual (under 36c, or 96.8f) pale skin rapid heartbeat breathlessnessblood poisoning is a medical emergency that usually requires admission to a hospital intensive care unit (icu) while antibiotics are used to fight the infection.if you’re taking certain medications for diabetes, such as metformin or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, they may be temporarily withdrawn until you recover. this is because they can cause kidney damage during an episode of blood poisoning.another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection is a condition called emphysematous pyelonephritis (epn).epn is a severe infection, where the tissues of the kidneys are rapidly destroyed and the bacteria causing the infection begin to release a toxic gas, which builds up inside the kidneys.the exact cause of epn is unclear, but almost all cases are in people with diabetes.the usual treatment is emergency surgery to remove some, or all, of the affected kidney. it’s possible to live a full and active life with only one kidney.in very rare cases, a kidney infection can cause severe kidney damage that results in kidney failure. this is when the kidneys stop working properly.kidney failure is potentially fatal, but it can be treated withdialysisor a kidney transplant.a kidney infection can also cause other complications, includinghigh blood pressure (hypertension)or premature labour or birth.the best way to prevent a kidney infection is to keep your bladder and urethra free from bacteria.these self-help tips explain how you can do this.drinking plenty of liquids, particularly water, will help to wash bacteria from your bladder and urinary tract.drinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry extracts may also help preventurinary tract infections (utis). however, you should avoid cranberry juice or extracts if you’re takingwarfarin, a medicine used to prevent blood clots. cranberry juice can make the effects of warfarin more potent, so there’s a risk of excessive bleeding.to help keep your urinary tract free from bacteria: go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in wipe from front to back after going to the toilet practice good hygiene by washing your genitals every day and before having sex empty your bladder after having sex if you’re a woman, avoid ‘hovering’ over a toilet seat as this position can often leave urine behind in the bladderconstipationcan increase your chances of developing a urinary tract infection (uti), so try to treat any constipation promptly.recommended treatments for constipation include: increasing the amount of fibre in your diet to 20g to 30g of fibre a day using a mildlaxativeon a short-term basis drinking plenty of fluidssee your gp if your symptoms don’t improve after 14 days (or 7 days for children with constipation).read more abouttreating constipationif you keep getting utis (more than 3 a year is considered high), avoid using spermicide-coatedcondomsordiaphragms. this is because spermicide can stimulate the production of bacteria.stick to lubricated condoms without spermicide, because unlubricated ones can irritate the urethra and make it more vulnerable to infection. kidney stones cystitis urinary tract infection

       " 'Kidney stones': 'kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 to 60.they’re quite common, with around 3 in 20 men and up to 2 in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives.the medical term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if they cause severe pain it’s known as renal colic.small kidney stones may go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine. but it’s fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the: ureter – the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder urethra – the tube urine passes through on its way out of the bodya blockage can cause severe pain in the abdomen or groin and sometimes causes aurinary tract infection (uti).read more about thesymptoms of kidney stones.the waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump.this is more likely to happen if you don’t drink enough fluids, if you’re taking some types of medication, or if you have a medical condition that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine.read more about thecauses of kidney stones.after a kidney stone has formed, your body will try to pass it out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). this means it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder).most kidney stones are small enough to be passed in your urine, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication.larger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or laser energy. occasionally, keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly.read more abouttreating kidney stones.it’s estimated that up to half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following 5 years.to avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day so you don’t becomedehydrated. it’s very important to keep your urine diluted (clear) to prevent waste products forming into kidney stones.read more aboutpreventing kidney stones.very small kidney stones are unlikely to cause many symptoms. it may even go undetected and pass out painlessly when you urinate.symptoms usually occur if the kidney stone: gets stuck in your kidney starts to travel down the ureter (the tube that attaches each kidney to the bladder) – the ureter is narrow and kidney stones can cause pain as they try to pass through causes an infectionin these cases, the symptoms of kidney stones can include: a persistent ache in the lower back, which is sometimes also felt in the groin – men may have pain in their testicles and scrotum periods of intense pain in the back or side of your abdomen, or occasionally in your groin, which may last for minutes or hours feeling restless and unable to lie still nausea (feeling sick) needing to urinate more often than normal pain when you urinate (dysuria) blood in your urine (haematuria) – this may be caused by the stone scratching the kidney or uretera kidney stone that blocks the ureter can lead to a kidney infection. this is because waste products are unable to pass the blockage, which may cause a build-up of bacteria.thesymptoms of a kidney infectionare similar to symptoms of kidney stones, but may also include: a high temperature (fever) of

on your digestive system), or a condition affecting the small intestine, such ascrohn’s diseasethere’s evidence to suggest that certain medications may increase your risk of developing recurrent kidney stones. these include: aspirin antacids diuretics (used to reduce fluid build-up) certainantibiotics certain antiretroviral medication (used to treathiv) certain anti-epileptic medicationkidney stones can develop for a number of reasons.calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and form if there’s too much calcium in the urine, which can be due to: an inherited condition called hypercalcuria, which leads to large amounts of calcium in urine an overactive parathyroid gland (the parathyroid glands help to regulate the amount of calcium in your body) kidney disease a rare condition called sarcoidosis some cancerscalcium stones are usually either large and smooth or spiky and rough.struvite stones are often caused by infections, and they most commonly occur after aurinary tract infectionthat’s lasted a long time.struvite stones are more common in women than men.uric acid stones can form if there’s a large amount of acid in your urine. they may be caused by: eating a high-protein diet that includes lots of meat a condition such asgoutthat prevents the body breaking down certain chemicals an inherited condition that causes higher than normal levels of acid in the body chemotherapycystine stones are the rarest type of kidney stone. they’re caused by an inherited condition called cystinuria, which affects the amount of acid that is passed in your urine.your gp will usually be able to diagnose kidney stones from your symptoms and medical history.it will be particularly easy if you’ve had kidney stones before.you may be given tests, including: urine tests to check for infections and pieces of stones an examination of any stones that you pass in your urine blood teststo check that your kidneys are working properly, and to also check the levels of substances that could cause kidney stones, such as calciumyou can collect a kidney stone by urinating through some gauze or a stocking.having a kidney stone to analyse will make a diagnosis easier, and may help your gp determine which treatment method will be of most benefit to you.if you have severe pain that isn’t controlled by painkillers, or if you have a high temperature as well as pain, you may be referred to a urologist (a specialist in treating urinary problems).if you’re referred to hospital for an imaging test, a number of different techniques may be used. imaging tests can help confirm the diagnosis, or identify precisely where a kidney stone is.these tests include: acomputerised tomography (ct) scan– where a series of x-rays at slightly different angles are taken and a computer is used to put the images together x-ray– an imaging technique that uses high-energy radiation to highlight abnormalities in body tissue anultrasound scan– uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body an intravenous urogram (ivu) or intravenous pyelogram (ivp) – a dye that shows up on x-ray is injected into a vein in your arm; the x-ray image highlights any blockages as the kidneys filter the dye out of your blood and into your urinect scans are now often used because they’re thought to be more accurate. ivus were previously the preferred imaging method. the imaging technique you have may depend on what’s available at your local hospital.most kidney stones are small enough (less than 4mm in diameter) to be passed out in your urine and can probably be treated at home.but even small kidney stones can be painful, although this usually only lasts a couple of days and disappears when the stone has been passed.if you are in severe pain, your gp can give you pain relief by injection. a second dose can be given after half an hour if you’re still experiencing pain.medication can also be injected to treat the symptoms of nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting. this is called an anti-emetic (anti-sickness) medication.you may also be given a prescription for painkillers, anti-emetics, or both, to take at home.you may be advised to wait until you pass your kidney stone when you go to the toilet, and to try to collect it from your urine. you can do this by filtering your urine through gauze or a stocking.give the stone to your gp so that they can have it analysed to help determine any further treatment you may need.you should drink enough water to make your urine colourless. if your urine is yellow or brown, you’re not drinking enough.if your kidney stone has moved into your ureter (the tube that carries waste products from the kidneys to the bladder), and it’s causing severe pain, your gp may admit you to hospital for treatment.this may be necessary if: you’re at an increased risk of your kidneys failing (for example, because you only have one kidney) your symptoms don’t improve within an hour of being given painkillers or anti-sickness medication you’re dehydrated and vomiting too much to keep fluids down you’re pregnant you’re over 60 years of ageif a kidney stone is too big to be passed naturally – 6mm to 7mm (about 0.23in to 0.27in) in diameter or larger – you may need treatment to remove it another way.this could include: extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) ureteroscopy percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pcnl) open surgerythe type of treatment you have will depend on the size and location of your stones.eswl is the most common way of treating kidney stones that can’t be passed in the urine.it involves usingultrasound(high-frequency sound waves) to pinpoint where a kidney stone is. ultrasound shock waves are then sent to the stone from a machine to break it into smaller pieces, so it can be passed in your urine.eswl can be an uncomfortable form of treatment, so it’s usually carried out after giving painkilling medication.you may need more than one session of eswl to successfully treat your kidney stones. eswl is up to 99% effective for stones up to 20mm (0.8in) in diameter.if a kidney stone is stuck in the ureter, you may need to have a ureteroscopy, which is also sometimes known as retrograde intrarenal surgery (rirs).it involves passing a long, thin telescope called a ureteroscope through your urethra (the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body) and into your bladder. it’s then passed up into your ureter to where the stone is stuck.the surgeon may either try to gently remove the stone using another instrument, or they may use laser energy to break it up into small pieces so that it can be passed naturally in your urine.ureteroscopy is carried out undergeneral anaesthetic(where you’re unconscious), so you shouldn’t drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure.for stones up to 15mm (0.6in), a ureteroscopy is effective in 50% to 80% of cases.a plastic tube called a stent may need to be temporarily inserted inside you to allow the stone fragments to drain into the bladder.pcnl is an alternative procedure that may be used for larger stones. it may also be used if eswl isn’t suitable – for example, because the person being treated is obese.pcnl involves using a thin telescopic instrument called a nephroscope. a small incision is made in your back and the nephroscope is passed through it and into your kidney. the stone is either pulled out or broken into smaller pieces using a laser or pneumatic energy.pcnl is always carried out under general anaesthetic, so you shouldn’t drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure.pcnl is 86% effective for stones that are 21mm to 30mm (0.8in to 1.2in) in diameter.nowadays, open surgery for kidney stones is rare. less than 1% of cases require this type of surgery. it’s only usually used if there’s a very large stone or abnormal anatomy.during open surgery, an incision will be made in your back so that your surgeon is able to access your ureter and kidney. the kidney stone can then be removed.if you have a uric acid stone, you may be advised to drink around 3 litres (just over 5 pints) of water each day to try to dissolve it.uric acid stones are much softer than other types of kidney stone, and they can be made smaller if they’re exposed to alkaline fluids.you may need to take some medication to make your urine more alkaline before the uric acid stone starts to dissolve.complications can occur following the treatment of large kidney stones. your surgeon should explain these to you before you have the procedure.possible complications will depend on the type of treatment you have and the size and position of your stones. complications could include: sepsis– an infection that spreads through the blood, causing symptoms throughout the whole body a blocked ureter – caused by stone fragments; the ureter is the tube that attaches the kidney to the bladder an injury to the ureter aurinary tract infection bleeding during surgery painit’s estimated that 5% to 9% of people may experience complications after having a ureteroscopy.the best way of preventing kidney stones is to make sure you drink plenty of water each day to avoid becoming dehydrated.keeping your urine diluted helps to stop waste products getting too concentrated and forming stones.you can tell how diluted your urine is by looking at its colour. the darker your urine is, the more concentrated it is.your urine is usually a dark yellow colour in the morning because it contains a build-up of waste products that your body has produced overnight.drinks such as tea, coffee and fruit juice can count towards your fluid intake, but water is the healthiest option and is best for preventing kidney stones developing.you should also make sure you drink more when it’s hot or when you’re exercising, to replenish fluids lost through sweating.read more aboutpreventing dehydration.if your kidney stone is caused by too much calcium, you may be advised to reduce the amount of oxalates in your diet.oxalates prevent calcium being absorbed by your body, and can accumulate in your kidney to form a stone.foods that contain oxalates include: beetroot asparagus rhubarb chocolate berries leeks parsley celery almonds, peanuts and cashew nuts soy products grains, such as oatmeal, wheat germ and wholewheatdon’t reduce the amount of calcium in your diet unless your gp advises you to. this is because calcium is very important for maintaining healthy bones and teeth.to avoid developing a uric acid stone, you should reduce the amount of meat, poultry and fish in your diet. you may also be prescribed medication to change the levels of acid or alkaline in your urine.if you have a kidney stone, medication will usually be prescribed for pain relief or to prevent infections developing.however, some medication may need to be reviewed by your gp if it’s thought to be causing your kidney stone.the type of medication your gp prescribes will depend on the type of kidney stone you have.for example, if you have: calcium stones – you may be prescribed a diuretic medication if they are caused by hypercalcuria (an inherited condition) struvite stones – you may be prescribedantibioticsto help prevent aurinary tract infectionorkidney infection, which are the main causes of struvite stones uric acid stones – you may be prescribed allopurinol (a medication used to lower uric acid levels) and medication to help alkalise your urine cystine stones – you may be prescribed medication to lower levels of cystine in your urine kidney infection chronic kidney disease

       " 'Lactose intolerance': \"lactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products.symptoms of lactose intolerance usually develop within a few hours of consuming food or drink that contains lactose. they may include: flatulence(wind) diarrhoea bloated stomach stomach cramps and pains stomach rumbling feeling sickthe severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you’ve consumed.some people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee.the symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it’s important to see your gp for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet.for example, the symptoms above can also be caused by: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs)– a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system milk protein intolerance – an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milkallergy)if your gp thinks you have lactose intolerance, they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve.read more aboutdiagnosing lactose intolerancethe body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. this breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream.people with lactose intolerance don’t produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it’s fermented by bacteria. this leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance.depending on the underlying reason why the body isn’t producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks.read more about thecauses of lactose intolerancein the uk, lactose intolerance is more common in people of asian or african-caribbean descent.lactose intolerance can develop at any age. many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected.lactose intolerance isn’t the same as a milk or dairy allergy.food allergiesare caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. this causes symptoms such as a rash, wheezing and itching.if you’re allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person).there’s no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to control the symptoms.depending on what dairy products you’re able to eat, you may also require additional calcium and vitamin d supplements to keep your bones strong and healthy. in some cases, your gp may refer you to a dietitian for further advice.in addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes may also be helpful. these are drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion of lactose.read more abouttreating lactose intolerancemilk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as a, b12 and d. lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. thesevitamins and mineralsare important for the development of strong, healthy bones.if you’re lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. this may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions: osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. if osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis. osteoporosis– where your bones become thin and weak. if you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased. malnutrition– when the food you eat doesn’t give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. if you’re malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed.if you’re concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. they can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements.your gp should be able to refer you to an nhs dietitian free of charge. alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. thebritish dietetic associationhas information on how to find a private dietitian.lactose intolerance is usually the result of your body not producing enough lactase.lactase is an enzyme (a protein that causes a chemical reaction to occur) normally produced in your small intestine that’s used to digest lactose.if you have a lactase deficiency, it means your body doesn’t produce enough lactase.after eating or drinking something containing lactose, it passes down your oesophagus (gullet) into your stomach, where it’s digested. the digested food then passes into your small intestine.the lactase in your small intestine should break lactose down into glucose and galactose (other types of sugar), which are then absorbed into your bloodstream. if there isn’t enough lactase, the unabsorbed lactose moves through your digestive system to your colon (large intestine).bacteria in the colon ferment (break down) the lactose, producing fatty acids and gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. the breakdown of the lactose in the colon, and the resulting acids and gases that are produced, cause the symptoms of lactose intolerance such asflatulenceand bloating.the main types of lactase deficiency are outlined below.primary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance worldwide. this type of lactase deficiency is caused by an inherited genetic fault that runs in families.primary lactase deficiency develops when your lactase production decreases as your diet becomes less reliant on milk and dairy products. this is usually after the age of two, when breastfeeding or bottle-feeding has stopped, although the symptoms may not be noticeable until adulthood.secondary lactase deficiency is a shortage of lactase caused by a problem in your small intestine. it can occur at any age, and may be the result of another condition, surgery to your small intestine, or taking certain medication.secondary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance in the uk, particularly in babies and young children.possible causes of secondary lactase deficiency include: gastroenteritis– an infection of the stomach and intestines coeliac disease– a bowel condition caused by an adverse reaction to a protein called gluten crohn’s disease– a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system ulcerative colitis– a long-term condition that affects the large intestine chemotherapy– a cancer treatment long courses ofantibioticsthe decrease in the production of lactase in secondary lactase deficiency is sometimes only temporary, but it may be permanent if it’s caused by a long-term condition.it’s also possible to develop secondary lactase deficiency later in life, even without another condition to trigger it. this is because your body’s production of lactase naturally reduces as you get older.congenital lactase deficiency is a rare condition that runs in families and is found in newborn babies.it’s caused by an inherited genetic fault that means affected babies produce very little or no lactase.the genetic mutation responsible for congenital lactase deficiency is passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. this means both parents must have a copy of the faulty gene to pass on the condition.some babies born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a temporary lactose intolerance because their small intestine wasn’t fully developed by the time they were born.this is known as developmental lactase deficiency and it usually improves as affected babies get older.it’s important to visit your gp if you think you or your child may have lactose intolerance, as the symptoms can be similar to other conditions.before seeing your gp, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what symptoms you experience. tell your gp if you notice any patterns, or if there are any foods you seem particularly sensitive to.your gp may suggest trying to remove lactose from your diet for two weeks to see if it helps to relieve your symptoms. this will provide further evidence of whether you’re lactose intolerant.other tests aren’t usually needed, but your gp may sometimes suggest further tests to: help confirm the diagnosis find out how much lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose) your body is producing try to determine what might be causing your lactose intolerancesome of the main tests that may be used are described below.a hydrogen breath test is a simple way of determining if you may be lactose intolerant.you’ll be asked to avoid eating or drinking during the night before the test. when you arrive for the test, you’ll be asked to blow up a balloon-like bag. this sample of your breath will be tested to find out how much hydrogen is present, measured in parts per million (ppm).you’ll then be given a drink of lactose solution and your breath will be tested every 15 minutes over the next few hours to see if the level of hydrogen changes.if your breath contains a large amount of hydrogen (more than 20ppm above your baseline) after consuming the lactose solution, it’s likely that you’re lactose intolerant. this is because lactose intolerance can cause the bacteria in the colon (large intestine) to produce more hydrogen than normal.in a lactose tolerance test, you’ll be given a drink of lactose solution and a blood sample will be taken from your arm using a needle. the blood will be tested to see how much glucose (blood sugar) it contains.if you’re lactose intolerant, your blood sugar levels will either rise slowly, or not at all. this is because your body is unable to break down the lactose into glucose.in a milk tolerance test, you’ll be given a glass of milk (about 500ml) and your blood sugar levels will be tested. if your blood sugar levels don’t rise after drinking the milk, you may be lactose intolerant.a small bowel biopsy is rarely used to diagnose lactose intolerance. however, it may be carried out to see if your symptoms are being caused by another condition, such ascoeliac disease.in a small bowel biopsy, a sample of your small intestinal lining is taken using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a light and a tiny cutting tool at the end) that’s passed down your throat. this will be carried out underlocal anaesthetic, so it won’t hurt.the sample of intestinal lining will be tested to see how much lactase it contains. if it only contains a small amount of lactase, it’s likely you’re lactose intolerant. the sample can also be examined to look for signs of possible underlying conditions such as coeliac disease.there’s no cure for lactose intolerance, but most people are able to control their symptoms by making changes to their diet.some cases of lactose intolerance, such as those caused bygastroenteritis, are only temporary and will improve within a few days or weeks. other cases, such as those caused by an inherited genetic fault or a long-term underlying condition, are likely to be lifelong.in most cases, cutting down on or avoiding sources of lactose and replacing them with lactose-free alternatives is enough to control the symptoms of lactose intolerance.the exact changes you need to make to your diet depend on how sensitive you are to lactose. some people are able to tolerate some lactose in their diet without any problems, whereas others experience symptoms after consuming food containing only a tiny amount of lactose.if you decide to experiment with what you can and can’t eat, make sure to introduce new foods gradually, rather than all at once. this will help you to get used to any foods you might be sensitive to and identify any that cause problems.eating fewer products containing lactose, or avoiding them completely, can mean you miss out on certainvitamins and mineralsin your diet and increase your risk of complications. you’ll also need to make sure you’re getting enough nutrition from either lacto-free foods or dietary supplements.if you or your child are extremely sensitive to lactose, talk to your gp about your diet.milk products are rich in calcium needed for healthy bones so you may need to have regular bone density checks.you may be referred to a dietitian (an expert in diet and nutrition) who can advise about what foods should be included in your, or your child’s, diet.some of the main sources of lactose you may need to cut down on or avoid if you’re lactose intolerant are described below.a major source of lactose is milk, including cow’s milk, goat’s milk and sheep’s milk. depending on how mild or severe your lactose intolerance is, you may need to change the amount of milk in your diet.for example: you may be able to have milk in your tea or coffee, but not on your cereal some products containing milk, such as milk chocolate, may still be acceptable in small quantities you may find that drinking milk as part of a meal, rather than on its own, improves how the lactose is absorbedif even a small amount of milk triggers your symptoms, there are some alternatives you can try, such as soya or rice milk (see below).other dairy products made from milk, such as butter, ice cream and cheese, can also contain high levels of lactose and may need to be avoided if you’re lactose intolerant.some dairy products however, such as hard cheese and yoghurt, contain lower levels of lactose than milk and other products, so you may still be able to have them.it’s worth experimenting with different foods to find out if there are any dairy products you can eat because they’re a good source of essential nutrients such as calcium.as well as milk and dairy products, there are other foods and drinks that can sometimes contain lactose.these include: salad cream, salad dressing and mayonnaise biscuits chocolate boiled sweets cakes some types of bread and other baked goods some breakfast cereals packets of mixes to make pancakes and biscuits packets of instant potatoes and instant soup some processed meats, such as sliced hamcheck the ingredients of all food and drink products carefully, because milk or lactose are often hidden ingredients.the lactose found in some foods won’t necessarily be listed separately on the food label, so you need to check the ingredients list for milk, whey, curds and milk products such as cheese, butter and cream.some ingredients may sound like they contain lactose when they don’t, such as lactic acid, sodium lactate and cocoa butter. these ingredients don’t need to be avoided if you’re lactose intolerant.some prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines and complementary medicines may contain a small amount of lactose. while this isn’t usually enough to trigger the symptoms of lactose intolerance in most people, it may cause problems if your intolerance is severe or you’re taking several different medicines.if you need to start taking a new medication, check with your gp or pharmacist in case it contains lactose.there are a number of alternative foods and drinks available in supermarkets to replace the milk and dairy products you need to avoid.food and drinks that don’t usually contain lactose include: soya milks, yoghurts and some cheeses milks made from rice, oats, almonds, hazelnuts, coconut, quinoa, and potato foods which carry the ‘dairy-free’ or ‘suitable for vegans’ signs carob barsyou can also buy cow’s milk containing additional lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose). this means you still get the nutritional benefits of the milk, but you’re less likely to experience any symptoms after consuming it.if you’re unable to eat most dairy products, you may not be getting enough calcium in your daily diet. calcium has several important functions, including: helping build strong bones and teeth regulating muscle contractions (including heartbeat) ensuring blood clots normallytherefore, it’s a good idea to choose lactose-free products with added calcium and ensure your diet contains alternative sources of calcium, such as: green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage and okra soya beans tofu nuts bread and anything made with fortified flour fish containing edible bones (for example, sardines, salmon, and pilchards)you can also buy combined calcium and vitamin d supplements from most pharmacists to help maintain good bone health.it’s important to check with your gp or dietitian whether you should be taking supplements, however, as taking excessively high levels of calcium can cause side effects.in addition to dietary changes, you may also find it useful to take liquid drops, tablets or capsules that contain lactase substitutes. these are available from most health foods shops.lactase substitutes replace the lactase your small intestine isn’t producing, which can reduce your symptoms by helping your body break down any lactose in your diet more easily.lactase substitutes can either be added to milk or taken just before eating a meal containing lactose.if your child is lactose intolerant, they may be able to consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing symptoms. this is quite safe, but you may need to experiment to find out how much they can comfortably eat or drink.if your child is unable to tolerate any lactose, your doctor may refer you to a dietitian for nutritional advice because it’s important for young children to have certain nutrients in their diet to ensure healthy growth and development.in general, the same rules about foods to try or to avoid are similar for children and adults (see above).for babies with lactose intolerance, lactose-free formula milk is available to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets. however, soya formula isn’t recommended for children under six months because it contains hormones that may interfere with your baby’s future physical and sexual development.breastfed babies may benefit from lactase substitute drops to help their bodies digest the lactose in breast milk.for many children, lactose intolerance is only temporary and will improve after a few weeks. after this point it’s safe to gradually reintroduce milk and dairy products into their diet.milk and other dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet. they contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as vitamins a, b12 and d.lactose is also important because it helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, including magnesium and zinc. these vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones.if you are lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. this may lead to unhealthy weight loss and put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions. osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. if osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis. osteoporosis– where your bones become thin and weak. if you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased.

against your throat to produce sound.read more abouttreating laryngeal cancerandrecovering from laryngeal cancer surgery.laryngeal cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the larynx, although it’s not clear exactly why this happens.all cancers begin with a change in a cell’s dna. dna provides our cells with a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce.a change in dna can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means cells continue to grow instead of stopping when they should. this causes the cells to reproduce in an uncontrollable manner, producing a growth of tissue called a tumour.it’s not known why the dna inside the cells of the larynx is affected in cases of laryngeal cancer. but it appears that exposure to things that can damage the cells and tissue of the larynx increases the risk of cancer developing.a number of things can increase your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.alcohol and tobacco are the 2 main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. they’re thought to contain chemicals that can damage the cells of the larynx.the more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.people who smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, or people who have smoked for more than 40 years, have been found to be about 40 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer than people who don’t smoke.compared to people who don’t drink, people who regularly drink large amounts of alcohol are about 3 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer.if you drink and smoke, your risk of laryngeal cancer increases even further. by stopping both drinking and smoking, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing the condition. read more aboutpreventing laryngeal cancer.people who have a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) diagnosed with head or neck cancer are thought to be twice as likely to develop laryngeal cancer as someone without a family history.there’s evidence to suggest that a diet high in red meat, processed food and fried food might increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.having a ‘mediterranean diet’ or a diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables may reduce your risk. read more aboutpreventing laryngeal cancer.human papilloma virus (hpv) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix (neck of the womb), anus, mouth and throat.hpv is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead tocervical cancer. it’s thought the virus may have a similar effect on the cells of the throat. hpv is often spread during sex, including oral sex.having a job where you’re exposed to high levels of certain substances may also increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. these include: asbestos coal or wood dust paint or diesel fumes nickel sulphuric acid fumes formaldehyde (a chemical used in a wide range of industrial processes, such as paint manufacturing and cosmetics) isopropyl alcohol (often used as a cleaning solvent)if you have symptoms of laryngeal cancer, such as a hoarse voice and pain when swallowing, your gp will ask about your symptoms and recent medical history.they may also examine the inside and outside of your throat for abnormalities, such as lumps and swellings.if laryngeal cancer is suspected, you’ll probably be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ent) department of your local hospital for further testing.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends that anyone aged 45 or over with persistent unexplained hoarseness or an unexplained lump in their neck should have an appointment with a specialist within 2 weeks.a nasendoscopy is a procedure used to get a clear view of your larynx.during the procedure, a small, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end (endoscope) is inserted into your nostril and passed down the back of your throat. the images from the endoscope are displayed on a monitor.you’ll usually be awake while this is carried out and it may feel uncomfortable. alocal anaestheticspray is sometimes used to numb your nose and throat beforehand, so you don’t feel any pain.if it wasn’t possible to get a good view of your larynx during a nasendoscopy, or a possible problem is spotted, you may have a further test called a laryngoscopy.like a nasendoscopy, this procedure involves using an endoscope to examine your larynx. however, the endoscope used during a laryngoscopy is longer and inserted through the mouth. this allows the larynx to be seen in greater detail.a laryngoscopy can be very uncomfortable, so it’s usually carried out undergeneral anaesthetic(where you’re asleep). you should be able to leave hospital as soon as you’ve recovered from the effects of anaesthetic, which is usually the same day or the day after.during a nasendoscopy or laryngoscopy, your doctor may use small instruments to remove a sample of cells from your larynx so it can be examined for signs of cancer. this is known as abiopsy.alternatively, if you have a lump in your neck, a needle and syringe can be used to remove a tissue sample. this is known as fine needle aspiration.if the results of the biopsy show you have cancer and there’s a risk it may have spread, you’ll probably be referred for further testing to assess how widespread the cancer is. the tests may include: acomputerised tomography (ct) scan– a series of x-rays are taken to build up a more detailed three-dimensional picture of your larynx and the surrounding tissue amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce a more detailed image of your larynx and the surrounding tissue a pet-ct scan – a ct scan is used to take pictures of the inside of your body after you’ve been injected with a mildly radioactive substance that helps to show cancerous areas more clearly anultrasound scan– high-frequency sound waves are used to check for signs of cancer in the lymph nodes (glands found throughout the body) near the larynxafter these tests have been completed, your doctor should be able to tell you the extent of the cancer. this is known as the stage and grade of the cancer.healthcare professionals use a system called the tnm system to stage laryngeal cancer. t describes the size of the tumour, n describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and m gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. the t stage is given as a number from 1 to 4 – small tumours confined to 1 part of the larynx are described as t1 tumours and large tumours that have grown into tissues outside the larynx are described as t4 the n stage is given as a number from 0 to 3 – n0 means the lymph nodes are not affected, whereas stages n2 to n3 mean that 1 or more lymph nodes are affected the m stage is given as either m0 or m1 – m0 means the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and m1 means that it hasthere are also 3 different grades (1 to 3) used to describe laryngeal cancer. lower-grade cancers, such as grade 1, tend to grow more slowly and are less likely to spread. higher-grade cancers, such as grade 3, grow quickly and are more likely to spread.you can read more about thestages and grades of laryngeal canceron the cancer research uk website.the treatment for laryngeal cancer largely depends on the size of the cancer. the main treatments are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (mdts) of specialists that work together to decide the best way to proceed with your treatment.members of your mdt will probably include a surgeon, a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and a specialist cancer nurse who will be responsible for co-ordinating your care.your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you’d like to ask your care team. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.your recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage of the cancer (seediagnosing laryngeal cancerfor more information on staging).if you have early-stage laryngeal cancer, it may be possible to remove the cancer using surgery (endoscopic resection) orradiotherapyalone. this may also be the case with slightly larger cancers, although a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is sometimes required.in later-stage laryngeal cancer, more extensive surgery may be needed. radiotherapy andchemotherapywill probably be used in combination. in some cases, the entire larynx may have to be removed.a medication called cetuximab may be used in cases where chemotherapy is not suitable.radiotherapy uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. it can be used as a treatment on its own for early-stage laryngeal cancer, or it can be used after surgery to stop cancerous cells returning. it’s sometimes combined with chemotherapy.the energy beams used during radiotherapy have to be precisely targeted to your larynx. to ensure the beams are directed at the exact area, a special plastic mask will be made to hold your head in the right position. a mould of your face will be taken so that the mask can be made before treatment starts.radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions from monday to friday, with a break from treatment at the weekend. the course of treatment usually lasts for 3 to 7 weeks.as well as killing cancerous cells, radiotherapy can affect healthy tissue and has a number of side effects, including: sore, red skin (similar tosunburn) mouth ulcers dry mouth loss of taste loss of appetite tiredness feeling sickyour mdt will monitor any side effects and treat them when possible. for example, protective gels can be used to treat mouth ulcers, and medicines are available for a dry mouth.radiotherapy can sometimes cause your throat tissue to become inflamed. severe inflammation can cause breathing difficulties. contact your key worker or visityour local accident and emergency (a&e) departmentas soon as possible if you have difficulty breathing.most side effects should pass within a few weeks of treatment finishing.read more aboutradiotherapy.there are 3 types of surgery that can be used to treat laryngeal cancer. they are: endoscopic resection partial laryngectomy total laryngectomyendoscopic resection can be used in early-stage laryngeal cancer.during the procedure, a surgeon uses a special microscope to get a magnified view of the larynx. this allows them to remove the cancer either with a laser or small surgical instruments.an endoscopic resection is carried out undergeneral anaesthetic, so you will be unconscious during the procedure and won’t feel any pain.your mouth and throat may feel sore for a few weeks after the operation and there’s a risk of your voice changing as a result of the procedure, which can be permanent.a partial laryngectomy can be used to treat some laryngeal cancers. the operation involves surgically removing the affected part of your larynx. some of your vocal cords will be left in place, so you will still be able to talk, but your voice may be quite hoarse or weak.while your larynx is healing, you may find breathing difficult. your surgeon may need to create a temporary hole in your neck, which will be attached to a tube you can breathe through. this is known as a temporary tracheostomy.once your larynx has healed, the tube can be removed and the hole will heal, leaving a small scar.this operation is uncommon nowadays, as endoscopic resection is preferred whenever possible.a total laryngectomy is usually used to treat advanced laryngeal cancer. the operation involves removing your entire larynx. nearby lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) may also need to be removed if the cancer has spread to them.as your vocal cords will be removed, you won’t be able to speak in the usual way after the operation. however, there are several ways to help restore your speech.if you have a total laryngectomy, your surgeon will also need to create a permanent hole in your neck (called a stoma) to help you breathe after the operation.you will be given training on how to keep your stoma clean. having a stoma can seem daunting and frightening at first, but most people get used to it after a few months.seerecovering from laryngeal cancerfor more information about speaking after surgery and looking after a stoma.chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medicines to damage the dna of the cancerous cells and stop them reproducing. it may be used to shrink a tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, or in combination with radiotherapy to make the radiotherapy more effective.it can also be used to treat laryngeal cancer that’s advanced or has come back after treatment. in this situation, it can relieve symptoms and may slow the cancer’s growth.chemotherapy medication is usually given as an injection into a vein (intravenously) once every 3 or 4 weeks, for up to 6 months. you may need to stay in hospital for a few days during each treatment or you may just come in for a short visit each time.chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. this, unfortunately, means side effects are common, such as: feeling and being sick hair loss loss of appetite diarrhoea sore mouth and mouth ulcers tirednesschemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection and illness.it’s therefore important to report any symptoms of potential infection to your mdt, such as a high temperature, chills or a persistent cough. you should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection.the side effects of chemotherapy should improve after your treatment has finished.read more aboutchemotherapy.cetuximab is a type of medication called biological therapy. these medications target and disrupt the processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce.cetuximab can be used in combination with radiotherapy to treat more advanced laryngeal cancer, when it’s not possible to use chemotherapy. for example, people with kidney or heart disease, or people with an ongoing infection, may not be able to have chemotherapy, because it could make them very ill.cetuximab is given slowly through a drip into your vein (intravenously) for up to an hour or more. it’s usually given weekly for up to 7 weeks.side effects of cetuximab are usually mild and include: rashes feeling sick diarrhoea breathlessnesscetuximab can also trigger allergic reactions in some people, which can cause problems such as a swollen tongue or throat. in a few cases, the reaction can be severe and potentially life-threatening.most serious reactions occur within a day of treatment starting, so you’ll be closely monitored once your treatment begins. if you have symptoms of a severe reaction, such as a rapid heartbeat or breathing problems, medication can be used to relieve them (such ascorticosteroids).if you’ve had some or all of your larynx removed (laryngectomy), it’s likely that you’ll need to spend 1 or 2 days in an intensive care unit until you’ve recovered.you won’t be able to eat until your throat has healed, which for most people takes at least a week or two. while your throat heals, you’ll need to be fed through a tube that’s passed through your nose and into your stomach.if you’ve had all of your larynx removed (total laryngectomy), you won’t be able to speak normally, because you will no longer have vocal cords. a number of techniques can be used to replicate the functions of your vocal cords although they can take weeks or months to learn.therefore, it’s likely that you’ll need to use alternative methods of communicating, such as using a pen or paper, during the first few weeks or months after surgery. this can be a frustrating experience – the loss of something you’ve previously taken for granted can be difficult to cope with.try to prepare yourself for strangers reacting in unpredictable and possibly upsetting ways. some people who have had a laryngectomy have reported that other people sometimes assume they’re deaf or have a learning difficulty because of their inability to speak.the emotional impact of living with a laryngectomy can be significant. many people report experiencing a rollercoaster effect.for example, you may feel down when laryngeal cancer is diagnosed, then feel up after the cancer has been removed, then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the practicalities of living with a laryngectomy.these emotional changes can sometimes trigger feelings ofdepression. you may be depressed if you have felt very down during the past month and you no longer take pleasure in doing things you enjoy.contact your gp or care team for advice if you think you may be depressed. there are a range of effective treatments available.thenational association of laryngectomee clubs (nalc)is also a useful resource for people trying to come to terms with living with a laryngectomy. nalc is a patient support group that provides advice on all aspects of living with a laryngectomy.if you’ve had all of your larynx removed, the surgeon will need to create a permanent hole in your throat through which you will breathe (a stoma). during the first few months after surgery, it’s likely that your stoma will produce a lot of mucus, particularly if you’ve hadradiotherapy.excessive mucus can cause breathing difficulties, so a tube may be attached to your stoma to help you breathe more easily. once the production of mucus has settled down, the tube can be removed.it’s important to clean your stoma at least once a day, otherwise it can become crusty and may become vulnerable to infection. a specialist nurse can teach you how to keep your stoma clean.you’ll be given special filters to place over your stoma that can help keep your stoma moist and free of germs.it’s important to remember that you’ll need to cover your stoma with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, rather than covering your mouth or nose. this is because mucus or saliva will come out of your stoma.if your larynx has been completely removed as part of your treatment for laryngeal cancer, you’ll need additional treatment to help restore your voice.before your laryngectomy, you may meet a speech and language therapist (slt) to discuss possible treatment options for restoring your voice. an slt is a healthcare professional who specialises in helping people who have difficulties speaking and using language.there are several different treatment options.a voice prosthesis is an artificial valve implanted into your neck. when you want to speak, you cover the stoma and breathe out through the valve.the valve produces a noise, which you can use to make words by moving your lips and mouth in the usual way. the voice that’s produced by the valve sounds natural, although it may be lower-pitched than your previous voice.if you choose to have a voice prosthesis, it can be fitted during the surgery to remove your larynx.oesophageal speech is a technique for speaking that your slt can teach you. it involves learning to push air through your oesophagus (gullet). as the air moves through your oesophagus, it vibrates and makes a noise. you can produce words by moving your lips and mouth.some people find it quite easy to learn oesophageal speech, whereas others find it difficult. regular practice by yourself and with your slt can help you improve.an electrolarynx is a small, battery-operated electrical device that vibrates and produces sound. you hold the device under your chin, and as you move your mouth and lips the vibrations translate into spoken words. your slt can train you to use it correctly.it’s thought that most laryngeal cancers can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle.avoiding tobacco products, cutting down on how much alcohol you drink and having a healthy diet are particularly important in reducing your chances of developing the condition.using tobacco products increases your chances of developing several different types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer.tobacco comes in many forms, including: cigarettes pipe tobacco cigars cigarillos snuff (powdered tobacco snorted through the nose) chewing tobaccoif you smoke or use other tobacco products, stopping will have both short- and long-term health benefits, including significantly reducing your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.if you decide to stop smoking your freenhs stop smoking servicecan help you give up. you can also callquit your way scotlandon 0800 84 84 84 for free expert advice and support.if you want to stop smoking, but don’t want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your gp should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may have.read more aboutstopping smoking.staying within therecommended guidelines for alcohol consumptionwill also reduce your risk of developing laryngeal and liver cancers.studies have found that your risk of developing laryngeal cancer reduces significantly within 5 to 10 years of not drinking, and after 20 to 30 years your risk is about the same as someone who has never drunk alcohol.contact your gp if you’re finding it difficult to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink. you may need additional treatment, which could include counselling, group work or medication.read more abouttreatments for alcohol misuseandtips on cutting down how much you drink.research shows a diet that contains plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly tomatoes, citrus fruit (such as oranges, grapefruits and lemons), olive oil and fish oil, may reduce your risk of getting laryngeal cancer. this type of diet is sometimes known as a ‘mediterranean diet’.eating plenty of fruit and vegetables

       " 'Laryngitis': 'laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx (voice box). in most cases, it gets better without treatment in about a week.symptoms of laryngitis can begin suddenly and usually get worse over a period of 2 to 3 days.common symptoms of laryngitis include:the hoarse voice and speaking difficulties usually get worse each day you’re ill. they may last for up to a week after the other symptoms have gone.in a few cases, the larynx can swell and cause breathing difficulties. this isn’t common in adults but can happen in young children who have smaller, narrower windpipes.laryngitis is often linked to another illness. for example, acold,flu,throat infectionortonsillitis. so you might also have other symptoms such as: aheadache swollen glands runny nose pain when swallowing feeling tired and achyyou or your child: have symptoms that are particularly severe or they last longer than 2 weeks experience breathing difficulties drink plenty of water try to rest your voice as much as possible do not smoke do not spend time in smoky or dusty placesif you see your gp, they’ll discuss the possible causes with you and may refer you for tests or to a specialist in hospital.in some cases, it may be possible to treat the underlying cause of laryngitis. for example, if the symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction, you may be able to: avoid the thing you’re allergic to take medication to help control your allergyin most cases, laryngitis is caused by either: a viral infection – such as acoldorflu irritation to your larynx – for example by straining your voice or refluxin these cases, most of the symptoms usually pass within a week. this is known as acute laryngitis.laryngitis can occasionally last much longer. this is known as chronic laryngitis. chronic laryngitis can be caused by: smoking alcohol misuse refluxas laryngitis is often caused by a common viral infection, such as a cold or flu, it’s not always possible to prevent it.there are things you can reduce your risk of developing the condition. avoid smoking make sure you have theflu vaccineevery year if you’re eligible wash your hands often, especially before handling food and after using the toilet avoid close contact with people who have respiratory infections, such as a cold or flu – particularly if you’re prone to laryngitis avoid irritants, such as smoke or dust – particularly if you have acoldor other respiratory infection raise your head with pillows when you’re sleeping to protect your larynx from any acid reflux from your stomach during sleep avoid regularly clearing your throat as this can irritate the larynx – try small sips of water instead follow thelow-risk drinking guidelineswhen drinking alcohol avoid shouting or singing loudly or for long periods of time common cold flu tonsillitis',\n",
       " 'Leg cramps': 'leg cramps are a common and usually harmless condition. they cause the muscles in your leg to suddenly become tight and painful.a leg cramp is an episode of sudden pain in the muscles of the leg. it’s caused by an involuntary contracting (shortening) of the leg muscle.cramps usually occur in the calf muscles, although they can affect any part of your leg. this includes your feet and thighs. cramps can last from a few seconds up to 10 minutes. thigh muscle cramps tend to last the longest.during a cramping episode, the affected muscles will become tight and painful and the feet and toes will be stiff.after the cramping has passed, you may have pain and tenderness in your leg for several hours.cramps often happen during the night when you’re sleeping.leg cramps might be a sign of a more serious health condition.if your gp is closed, phone 111. your leg cramps are affecting your quality of life you’re having frequent leg cramps your leg cramps are interfering with your sleep you also have numbness or swelling in your legs your leg muscles are shrinking or becoming weakeryour gp will ask about your symptoms and examine your legs and feet. they may also ask if you have other symptoms, like numbness or swelling. this may be a sign that you have secondary leg cramps caused by an underlying condition.in this case, you may need further tests, likeblood testsand urine tests, to rule out other conditions.the cause of leg cramps is sometimes unknown (idiopathic). in other cases, there may be an underlying condition or identifiable cause (secondary leg cramps).idiopathic leg cramps may be caused by: abnormal nerve activity during sleep excessive strain placed on leg muscles, for example during exercise a sudden restriction in the blood supply to the affected musclesalso, tendons naturally shorten over time as a person gets older. this may explain why older people are particularly affected by leg cramps. tendons are tough bands of tissue that connect muscles to bone. if your tendons become too short, they may cause the muscles connected to them to cramp.secondary leg cramps are caused by an underlying condition or another identifiable cause like: pregnancy – the extra weight of pregnancy can place strain on the leg muscles, making them more vulnerable to cramping exercise – leg cramps are often experienced when resting after exercise neurological conditions – for example,motor neurone diseaseorperipheral neuropathy liver disease– if your liver stops working properly, toxins will build up in your blood, which can make your muscles spasm infection – some types of bacterial infection, like tetanus, can cause muscle cramps and spasm toxins – in some people, high levels of toxic (poisonous) substances in the blood, like lead or mercury, can cause leg cramps dehydration– in some people, low levels of water in the body can lead to a drop in your salt levels, which can trigger muscle crampsmedication is usually only needed in persistent cases where cramping does not respond to exercise.if you have secondary leg cramps, treating the underlying cause may help relieve your symptoms.leg cramps that occur during pregnancy should pass after the baby is born.treating cramps that occur as a result of serious liver disease can be more difficult. your treatment plan may include using medications like muscle relaxants.certain medications have been known to cause leg cramps in a small number of people. if you develop leg cramps after starting a new medication, speak to your pharmacist.never stop taking a prescribed medication unless your gp or healthcare professional advises you to do so.most cases of leg cramps can be relieved by exercising the affected muscles. exercising your legs during the day will often help reduce how often you get cramping episodes.to stretch your calf muscles:if you often get leg cramps, regularly stretching the muscles in your lower legs may help prevent the cramps or reduce their frequency.you might find it useful to stretch your calves before you go to bed each night.if you lie on your back, make sure that your toes point upwards. placing a pillow on its side at the end of your bed, with the soles of your feet propped up against it may help keep your feet in the right position.if you lie on your front, hang your feet over the end of the bed. this will keep your feet in a relaxed position. it’ll help stop the muscles in your calves from contracting and tensing.keep your sheets and blankets loose.',\n",
       " 'Lichen planus': 'lichen planus is a non-infectious, itchy rash that can affect many areas of the body.affected areas can include the: arms, legs and trunk mouth (oral lichen planus) nails and scalp vulva, vagina and penisthe exact cause of lichen planus is unknown. however, the condition isn’t infectious and doesn’t usually run in families. it can’t be passed on to other people, including sexual partners.a gp can usually diagnose lichen planus by examining the rash and asking about your symptoms. oral lichen planus is often diagnosed by a dentist during routine dental check-ups.lichen planus is thought to affect 1-2% of the worldwide population. it’s more common in adults over the age of 40.lichen planus of the skin affects men and women equally. however, oral lichen planus is more common in women. the mouth is affected in around 50% of all cases of lichen planus (oral lichen planus).there’s no single treatment that can cure lichen planus completely. however, treatments are available to help manage the symptoms and make living with it easier. for example,steroid creamsor ointments are often used to help relieve the itch and control the rash.most cases of lichen planus of the skin clear up on their own within 6 to 9 months. the rash rarely lasts longer than 18 months. however, oral lichen planus and lichen planus that affects the genital area may be more persistent.read more abouthow lichen planus is treated.erosive lichen planus is a rare form of lichen planus that can last a long time. it causes painful ulcers to develop in the mouth and in the genital areas of both males and females.in some cases, long-term erosive lichen planus can increase the chance of some types ofcancerdeveloping.read our page oncomplications of lichen planusfor more information about erosive lichen planus.the symptoms of lichen planus vary, depending on which area of the body is affected.areas of the body most commonly affected by the condition include the: skin mouth penis vulva (external female sex organs) and vaginathe symptoms of lichen planus of the skin are: purple-red coloured bumps (papules) that are slightly raised, shiny and have a flat top. the papules usually measure 3-5mm in diameter and may also have irregular white streaks (wickham’s striae) thicker scaly patches can appear, usually around the ankles – this is known as hypertrophic lichen planus itchy skinlichen planus of the skin often affects the wrists, ankles and lower back, although other parts of the body can also be affected.thickened (hypertrophic) lichen planus affects the shins, and ring-shaped lichen planus affects creases in the skin, such as the armpits.after the papules have cleared, the affected area of skin can sometimes become discoloured.the symptoms of oral lichen planus are: a white pattern on the tongue and inner cheeks red and white patches in the mouth burning and discomfort in the mouth while eating or drinking painful red gumsmild cases of oral lichen planus don’t usually cause any pain or discomfort.the symptoms of lichen planus of the penis are: purple or white ring-shaped patches on the tip of the penis (glans) bumps (papules) that are flat-topped and shiny a non-itchy rashthe symptoms of lichen planus of the vulva and vagina include: soreness, burning and rawness around the vulva the vulva may be covered in white streaks and be a red, pink or pale white colour if the vagina is affected, sexual intercourse can be painful if the outer layers of skin break down, moist, red patches can form scar tissue can form, which distorts the shape of the vagina a sticky yellow or green discharge, which may be bloodstained the opening of the vagina can become narrowedlichen planus can sometimes affect other areas, including: the nails – which can become thinner, ridged and grooved, or they may become darker, thicker or raised; they may sometimes shed or stop growing the scalp – red patches can appear around clusters of hair; in some cases, permanent hair loss can occurthe cause of lichen planus is unknown.it’s thought to be related to the immune system, or an abnormal response of the immune system to certain medicines.lichen planus isn’t infectious, doesn’t usually run in families and can’t be passed on to others.the immune system protects your body against illness and infection by producing antibodies (proteins) that attack bacteria and viruses.in people with lichen planus, it’s thought that the immune system becomes overactive, causing an excess amount of proteins to be produced, which inflame the skin. this is known as an autoimmune reaction and causes thesymptoms of lichen planus.a reaction to certain medications is another possible cause of lichen planus. for example: gold injections – these are disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) that are sometimes injected into the muscles of people witharthritisto help reduce inflammation and painful joints antimalarial tablets – these help treat and preventmalaria(a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes)lichen planus is often diagnosed by a gp or dentist examining the affected area.your gp may be able to make a diagnosis based on the characteristic rash. however, lichen planus can be mistaken for other skin conditions, such aseczema, which also causes the skin to become red, flaky and itchy.if your doctor is unable to make a confident diagnosis by examining your skin, they may want to take a small skin sample (biopsy), which will be examined under a microscope.if a skin biopsy is required, you’ll be given alocal anaestheticto numb the affected area so you don’t feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure.a dentist or doctor can diagnose oral lichen planus by looking at the inside of your mouth.a biopsy may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis. a sample of mouth tissue will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope. as with lichen planus of the skin, you’ll be given a local anaesthetic to numb the pain.there’s no cure for lichen planus, so treatments aim to ease the symptoms and clear the rash. mild lichen planus doesn’t require treatment.below is some general self-help advice that can help ease your symptoms and prevent them getting worse. avoid washing with soap or bubble bath – use plain warm water instead wash your hair over a basin to stop affected areas of skin coming into contact with shampoo use an emollient to moisturise your skin avoid eating spicy foods and anything acidic, such as fruit juice, because they can irritate oral lichen planus avoid eating sharp food, such as crusty bread avoid drinking alcohol, particularly spirits if areas of your mouth are painful, stick to soft, bland foods, such as mashed potatoes and porridge if possible, continue to use your usual toothpaste avoid using mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they may be too strong, and keep your mouth as clean as possible visit your dentist regularly to help keep your teeth and gums healthy avoid washing with soap or bubble bath – use plain warm water or a soap substitute instead, such as aqueous cream use an emollient, such as petroleum jelly, before and after urinating applying ice packs to the affected areas may soothe itching and swelling (never apply an ice pack directly to your skin – wrap it in a clean tea towel before placing it on your body) women should avoid wearing tightsthere are a number of medications and treatments that may be recommended for lichen planus of the skin, hair and nails. these are outlined below.corticosteroid creams and ointments contain corticosteroids (artificial hormones) and are used to treat inflammatory skin conditions. they are often referred to astopical corticosteroids.topical corticosteroids help treat the swelling (inflammation) and redness caused by lichen planus. strong topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are also effective in reducing any itchiness you may have.treatment is applied to the red or purple itchy spots, but should be stopped when the colour of the rash changes to brown or grey. this pigment change occurs when the inflammation has settled. continuing to apply the corticosteroid cream to the brown areas of skin will gradually cause the skin to thin. the side effects of corticosteroids can vary, depending on the: type and severity of treatment being used how long the treatment is used for nature of the condition being treatedpotential side effects of topical corticosteroids can include: redness or burning and stinging of the skin skin rash thinning of the skin (atrophy) stretch marks (striae) contact dermatitis – a condition that causes skin inflammation excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) lightening of the skinalways check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.corticosteroid tabletsare sometimes used to treat severe cases of lichen planus, when the symptoms aren’t being effectively controlled with creams or ointments.possible side effects of corticosteroid tablets used on a short-term basis can include: increased appetite weight gain insomnia fluid retention (inability to pass urine) mood changes, such as feeling irritable or anxiousother treatments recommended for lichen planus of the skin are outlined below. antihistamines – these are often used to treat symptoms ofallergies, such as itchy skin. if you have lichen planus of the skin that’s causing itchiness, antihistamines may be prescribed to help reduce this. light treatment – there are 2 types of light treatment: ultraviolet b (uvb) and psoralen plus ultraviolet a (puva). uvb is the most commonly used light treatment, but puva may be recommended in severe or widespread cases of lichen planus that don’t respond to other types of treatment. acitretin – this medication is only prescribed by a specialist and is used to treat severe cases of lichen planus. the tablets have some associated side effects and may not mix well with other medicines. your specialist can offer advice.mild cases of oral lichen planus won’t need any treatment. in more severe cases, treatment includes: a mouthwash that contains an anaesthetic to temporarily numb the mouth, which makes eating easier corticosteroid sprays, mouthwashes, pastes and dissolvable lozenges a mouthwash or gel that contains an antiseptic to help prevent the build-up of plaque in your mouthin more severe cases of oral lichen planus, corticosteroid tablets may also be used on a short-term basis.it can be difficult to prevent oral lichen planus, but to keep the lining of your mouth healthy it’s recommended that you: stop smoking(if you smoke) avoid drinking large amounts ofalcohol have ahealthy, balanced diet, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetablesyou should also maintaingood oral hygieneby cleaning your teeth at least twice a day, and having regulardental check-ups, so that any problems with your teeth or mouth can be identified and treated early.if corticosteroids are not effective in treating your symptoms, you may be prescribed a medication that suppresses your immune system to try to limit the autoimmune reaction that’s thought to cause lichen planus.these types of treatments are known as immunomodulating agents. depending on which area of your body is affected by lichen planus, treatments that may be recommended for you can include: treatments such as tacrolimus topical immunomodulating agents (used to treat lichen planus of the skin) – treatments such as tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream are rubbed directly onto the skin immunomodulating agents (used to treat lichen planus of the mouth) – these are usually available in the form of tablets or capsules, and can be used to treat severe cases of oral lichen planusthese treatments can cause a number of different side effects, which your specialist can discuss with you.you’ll also need to have regularblood testswhile taking immunomodulating agents, particularly in the early stages of treatment.you can find support and information from organisations like: changing faces– a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advicecomplications of lichen planus may include discoloured skin and, in some cases, erosive lichen planus may develop into certain types of cancer.after the lichen planus rash has cleared up, the affected area of skin may be a different colour to what it was originally. there may be a brown or grey mark, which can sometimes last for months. this is known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and tends to be more noticeable in people with darker skin.erosive lichen planus is a long-lasting (chronic) form of lichen planus that causes painful ulcers to develop, as well as burning and discomfort in the genital areas of both male and females.occasionally, in around 2% of cases, long-term cases of erosive lichen planus can develop into certain types ofcancer, such as: mouth cancer vulval cancer penile cancerregularly examining yourself and being aware of any changes that occur will help you to identify any problems at an early stage. pay close attention to ulcerated areas in your mouth or genitals that don’t heal and persist for a long time. visit your gp immediately if you notice any changes that you’re concerned about.you should also visit your dentist regularly to ensure that your teeth and gums remain healthy, and that any ulcers or patches that form in your mouth are examined and treated promptly. depending on individual circumstances, dental check-ups for adults are recommended anywhere between every 3 to 24 months.read more abouttreating lichen planus, including self-help tips for managing

       " 'Liver cancer': 'primary liver cancer is an uncommon but serious type of cancer that begins in the liver.this is a separate condition from secondary liver cancer, which occurs when cancer that first develops in another part of the body spreads to the liver.the rest of this article refers to primary liver cancer only. the macmillan cancer support website has more information aboutsecondary liver cancer.symptoms of liver cancer are often vague and don’t appear until the cancer is at an advanced stage. they can include: unexplained weight loss loss of appetite feeling very full after eating, even if the meal was small feeling sick and vomiting pain or swelling in your abdomen (tummy) jaundice (yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes) itchy skin feeling very tired and weakspeak to your gp if you notice any of these symptoms. although they are more likely to be the result of a more common condition, such as an infection, it’s best to have them checked.you should also contact your gp if you have previously been diagnosed with a condition known to affect the liver, such ascirrhosisor ahepatitis cinfection, and your health suddenly deteriorates.the exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but most cases are associated with damage and scarring of the liver known as cirrhosis.cirrhosis can have a number of different causes, including drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years and having a long-termhepatitis borhepatitis cviral infection.it is also believed obesity and an unhealthy diet can increase the risk of liver cancer because this can lead tonon-alcoholic fatty liver disease.by avoiding or cutting down on alcohol,eating healthilyandexercising regularly, and taking steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected with hepatitis b and c, you may be able to significantly reduce your chances of developing liver cancer.read more about thecauses of liver cancer.despite being a common type of cancer worldwide, liver cancer is relatively uncommon in the uk. however, the chances of developing the condition are high for people with risk factors for the condition.the number of people affected by liver cancer rises sharply with age, with around 8 in every 10 cases diagnosed in people aged 60 or older, although it also affects many people younger than this. around 2 in every 3 cases affect men.over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the uk have risen considerably, possibly as a result of increased levels of alcohol intake and obesity.liver cancer is usually diagnosed after a consultation with a gp and a referral to a hospital specialist for further tests, such as scans of your liver.however, regular check-ups for liver cancer (known as surveillance) are often recommended for people known to have a high risk of developing the condition, such as those with cirrhosis.having regular check-ups helps ensure the condition is diagnosed early. the earlier liver cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment is likely to be.read more aboutdiagnosing liver cancer.treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage the condition is at. if diagnosed early, it may be possible to remove the cancer completely.treatment options in the early stages of liver cancer include: surgical resection – surgery to remove a section of liver liver transplant– where the liver is replaced with a donor’s liver microwave or radiofrequency ablation – where microwaves or radio waves are used to destroy the cancerous cellshowever, only a small proportion of liver cancers are diagnosed at a stage where these treatments are suitable. most people are diagnosed when the cancer has spread too far to be removed or completely destroyed.in these cases, treatments such aschemotherapywill be used to slow down the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms such as pain and discomfort.read more abouttreating liver cancer.the exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but many cases are linked to a problem with the liver calledcirrhosis. this is where the tissue of the liver has become scarred and cannot perform many of its usual functions.cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue known as a tumour.in cases of liver cancer, it is uncertain why and how the cells of the liver are affected, but it appears that cirrhosis can increase a person’s chances of developing the condition.however, most cases of cirrhosis do not lead to liver cancer, and people without cirrhosis can also develop liver cancer.the liver is a tough and resilient organ. it can endure a high level of damage that would destroy other organs and is capable of regenerating itself. but despite the liver’s resilience, excessive alcohol intake over many years can damage it.every time you drink alcohol, your liver filters out the poisonous alcohol from your blood and some of the liver cells die. the liver can regenerate new cells, but if you drink heavily for many years, your liver will lose the ability to do this and it can become damaged and scarred over time.non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseoccurs when small deposits of fat build up inside the tissue of the liver. it’s a common condition and causes no noticeable symptoms in most people.however, in some people, high levels of fat can make the liver inflamed. over time, the inflammation can scar the liver.the exact cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unclear, but it is associated withobesityandtype 2 diabetes.a long-term infection ofhepatitis ccan cause inflammation and scarring of the liver.hepatitis c is spread by blood contact. the most common ways this happens worldwide include poor medical practice with the use of contaminated needles, or injected drug use, where any item of injecting equipment (not just needles) is shared.if you smoke or regularly drink alcohol and have hepatitis c, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.early treatment of long-term hepatitis c with antiviral medication can prevent the liver from becoming scarred.hepatitis bis a virus that can be spread through contaminated blood and other types of bodily fluids, such as saliva, semen and vaginal fluids.like hepatitis c, hepatitis b is spread through blood contact. it is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth or from child to child in early life (usually in areas outside the uk where the infection is very common), and very rarely sexually or through injecting drugs.it affects about 1 in every 200 people in the uk. most of those infected were born in parts of the world where the hepatitis b virus is very common.as with hepatitis c, hepatitis b can also cause inflammation and scarring of the liver over time.if you smoke or drink and have hepatitis b, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.early treatment of long-term hepatitis b with antiviral medication is not always needed, but can substantially reduce the risk of the liver becoming scarred.haemochromatosis is a genetic condition where the body stores too much iron from food.the excess levels of iron have a poisonous effect on the liver and cause scarring over time, although treatment can reduce the risk of the condition leading to liver cancer.primary biliary cirrhosis is a rare and poorly understood liver condition.one of the main functions of the liver is to create a fluid called bile, used by the body to help break down fat. the bile is transported to the digestive system via a series of tubes called bile ducts.for reasons that are unclear, in cases of primary biliary cirrhosis, the bile ducts gradually become damaged. this eventually leads to a build-up of bile inside the liver, which damages the liver and causes cirrhosis.for many people, the first stage of diagnosing liver cancer is a consultation with a gp, although people at risk are usually tested regularly for the condition.if you visit your gp, they will ask about your symptoms, when they started, and when they are noticeable. they will also examine you.if they feel you need further tests, they will refer you to a hospital specialist.if you are in a high-risk group for developing liver cancer, regular screening – known as surveillance – is often recommended. this is because the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chance there is of curing it.surveillance is usually carried out every 6 months and often involves: ultrasound scans– high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of your liver, which can highlight any abnormalities blood tests– your blood is tested for a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (afp), which is found in some people with liver cancersurveillance is usually recommended if you havecirrhosis(scarring of the liver), although there are other factors that can also affect your risk of liver cancer.the potential benefits of surveillance should be discussed with you before you enter any screening programme.the tests above can also be used to look for liver cancer in people who are not being routinely screened.if these initial tests suggest there is a chance you could have liver cancer, one or multiple tests will usually be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.the further tests include: computerised tomography (ct) scans– a series of x-rays of your liver are taken to give a more detailed three-dimensional image magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans– uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to build up a picture of the inside of your liver biopsy– a needle is inserted into your abdomen (tummy) to remove a small sample of liver tissue, which is then tested in a laboratory for cancerous cells laparoscopy – a small incision is made in your abdomen undergeneral anaesthetic(where you are asleep) and a flexible camera called an endoscope is used to examine your liverafter these tests have been carried out, it will usually be possible to confirm a diagnosis of liver cancer and determine the condition’s stage.staging is a term used to describe how far a particular cancer has spread. there are a number of different systems used to stage liver cancer.many liver cancer specialists use combination staging systems that include features of both the cancer and the underlying liver function to stage a person’s condition.this is because the length of time a person lives and how well they tolerate potential treatments will be determined not only by how advanced their cancer is, but also by their level of health and how good their underlying liver function is.one combination system for staging liver cancer is known as the barcelona clinic liver cancer (bclc) staging system. the bclc staging system consists of 5 stages. these are: stage 0 – the tumour is less than 2cm (20mm) in diameter and the person is very well and has normal liver function stage a – a single tumour has grown but is less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter, or there are 3 or fewer smaller tumours less than 3cm (30mm) in diameter and the person is very well with normal liver function stage b – there are multiple tumours in the liver, but the person is well and their liver function is unaffected stage c – any of the above circumstances, but the person is not so well and their liver function is not so good, or where the cancer has started to spread into the main blood vessel of the liver, nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body stage d – where the liver has lost most of its functioning abilities and the person begins to have symptoms of end-stage liver disease, such as a build-up of fluid inside their abdomenthe treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage of the condition. treatment can include surgery and medication.most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (mdts) to treat liver cancer. these are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.your recommended treatment plan will depend on thestageyour liver cancer is at.if your cancer is at stage a when diagnosed, a complete cure may be possible. the 3 main ways this can be achieved are: removing the affected section of liver – known as a resection having a liver transplant – an operation to remove the liver and replace it with a healthy one using heat to kill cancerous cells – known as microwave or radiofrequency ablation (rfa)if your cancer is at stage b or c, a cure is not usually possible. however, chemotherapy can slow the progression of the cancer, relieve symptoms, and prolong life for months or, in some cases, years. there is also a medication called sorafenib that can help prolong life.if your cancer is at stage d when diagnosed, it is usually too late to slow down the spread of the cancer. instead, treatment focuses on relieving any symptoms of pain and discomfort you may have.if damage to your liver is minimal and the cancer is contained in a small part of your liver, it may be possible to remove the cancerous cells during surgery. this procedure is known as surgical resection.as the liver can regenerate itself, it may be possible to remove a large section of it without seriously affecting your health. however, in the majority of people with liver cancer, their liver’s regenerative ability may be significantly impaired and resection may be unsafe.whether or not a resection can be performed is often determined by assessing the severity of yourcirrhosis(scarring of the liver).if a liver resection is recommended, it will be carried out under ageneral anaesthetic, which means you will be asleep during the procedure and won’t feel any pain as it is carried out.most people are well enough to leave hospital within a week or two of having surgery. however, depending on how much of your liver was removed, it may take several months for you to fully recover.liver resection is a complicated surgery and can have a considerable impact on your body. there is a significant risk of complications occurring during and after surgery.possible complications of liver resection include: infection at the site of the surgery bleeding after the surgery blood clots that develop in your legs – the medical term for this isdeep vein thrombosis (dvt) bile leaking from the liver – further surgery may be required to stop the leak jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) liver failure (where your liver is no longer able to function properly)liver resection can also sometimes cause fatal complications, such as a heart attack.a liver transplant involves removing a cancerous liver and replacing it with a healthy liver from a donor.this is a major operation and there is a risk of potentially life-threatening complications.a liver transplant may be suitable for you if you: only have a single tumour less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter have 3 or fewer small tumours, each less than 3cm (30mm) have responded exceptionally well to other treatments, with no evidence of tumour growth for 6 monthsif you have multiple tumours or a tumour larger than 5cm, the risk of the cancer returning is usually so high that a liver transplant will be of no benefit.if you are suitable for a liver transplant, you will normally need to be placed on a waiting list until a donor liver becomes available. the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 142 days for adults.in some cases, a small part of the liver of a living relative can be used. this is known as a living donor liver transplant.the advantage of using a living donor liver transplant is that the person receiving the transplant can plan the procedure with their medical team and relative, and will not usually have to wait very long.read more aboutliver transplants.microwave or radiofrequency ablation (rfa) may be recommended as an alternative to surgery to treat liver cancer at an early stage, ideally when the tumour or tumours are smaller than 5cm (50mm) in diameter.they can also be used to treat tumours larger than this, but the treatment may need to be repeated in such cases.these treatments involve heating the tumours with microwaves or radio waves produced by small, needle-like electrodes. this heat kills the cancer cells and causes the tumours to shrink.similar procedures using lasers or freezing can also achieve the same result.there are 3 main ways microwave ablation or rfa can be carried out: where the needles are passed through the skin (percutaneously) where the needles are inserted through small incisions in your abdomen – ‘keyhole’ surgery (laparoscopy) where the needles are inserted through a single large incision made in your abdomen – ‘open’ surgerycontinuousultrasoundorcomputerised tomography (ct) scansare used to make sure the needles are guided into the correct position.microwave ablation or rfa can be carried out under general anaesthetic orlocal anaesthetic(where you are awake but the area being treated is numbed), depending on the technique used and the size of the area being treated.how long it takes to carry out the treatment depends on the size and number of tumours being treated, but it usually takes between 1 and 3 hours in total. most people need to stay overnight in hospital.you may experience some minor discomfort andflu-like symptoms, such as chills and muscle pains, for a few days after the procedure.the risk of complications occurring with microwave ablation or rfa is low, but possible problems can include bleeding, infection, minor burns and damage to nearby organs.chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medications to slow the spread of liver cancer.a type of chemotherapy called transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (tace) is usually recommended to treat cases of stage b and c liver cancer. in these cases, the treatment can prolong life, but cannot cure the cancer.tace may also be used to help prevent cancer spreading out of the liver in people waiting for a liver transplant.it is not recommended for stage d liver cancer because it can make the symptoms of liver disease worse.during tace a fine tube called a catheter is inserted into the main blood vessel in your groin (femoral artery) and passed along the artery to the main blood vessel that carries blood to the liver (hepatic artery).chemotherapy medication is injected directly into the liver through the catheter and either a gel or small plastic beads are injected into the blood vessels supplying the tumours to help slow down the speed they grow.tace usually takes one to 2 hours to complete. after the procedure, you will stay in hospital overnight before returning home.this procedure can be completed several times if necessary.injecting chemotherapy medications directly into the liver, rather than into the blood, has the advantage of avoiding the wide range of side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, such as hair loss and tiredness.however, the procedure is not free of side effects and complications. the most common side effect is post-chemoembolisation syndrome, which can cause abdominal (tummy) pain and a high temperature (fever), as well as making you vomit or feel sick.these symptoms may last for a few weeks after a tace session.read more aboutchemotherapy.if you only have a few small tumours, alcohol (ethanol) injections may be used as a treatment. a needle passes through the skin to inject alcohol into the cancerous cells. this dehydrates the cells and stops their blood supply.in most cases, this is carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area is numbed so you won’t feel any pain.sorafenib is a medication given in tablet form that can disrupt the blood supply to liver tumours and slow down their growth.it is sometimes used as a treatment for advanced cases of liver cancer, although it is not routinely available on the nhs because the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has said the cost of the medication is high for the limited benefit it offers.whether or not you are eligible for sorafenib will be decided by your medical team, and will depend on the likelihood of whether you will significantly benefit from the medication.for more information, see thenice guidelines on sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.treatment for advanced liver cancer focuses on relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort, rather than attempting to slow down the progression of the cancer.some people with advanced liver cancer require strong painkillers, such as codeine or possibly morphine. nausea and constipation are common side effects of these types of painkillers, so you may also be given an anti-sickness tablet and a laxative.read more aboutend of life care. cirrhosis cancer research uk: liver cancer macmillan

       " 'Liver tumours': 'liver tumours can be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). boys are affected more commonly than girls.there are 2 main types of primary liver cancer.this usually occurs in children under 5 years old.this is rarer and usually occurs in older children.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.the liver is the largest organ in the body. it’s surrounded by a fibrous capsule and is divided into sections called lobes. it lies across the upper part of the abdomen and is larger on the right-hand side of the body than on the left. it’s surrounded, and protected from injury, by the lower ribs.the liver is an extremely important organ that has many functions. one of these functions is to produce proteins that circulate in the blood. some of the proteins help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding. others are essential for maintaining the balance of fluid in the body. the liver also destroys harmful substances. it breaks down waste products not used by the body so that they can be passed out in the urine or stools (bowel motions).the liver is responsible for breaking down food containing carbohydrates (sugars) and fats, so they can be used by the body for energy. it stores substances such as glucose and vitamins so that they can be used by the body when needed.the liver also produces bile, a substance that breaks down the fats in food so that they can be absorbed from the bowel (intestine).the liver is connected to the small intestine (duodenum) by a tube called the bile duct. this duct takes the bile produced by the liver to the intestine.the liver has an amazing ability to repair itself. it can function normally even if only a small part of it is working.the cause of most primary liver tumours in the western world is unknown. however, in other parts of the world, hepatocellular cancer (hcc) is commonly related to the presence of liver infection. this happens in countries where mothers commonly have hepatitis b and vaccination is not readily available at birth for their children.children who are infected with hepatitis b have a higher risk of developing hcc in late childhood than uninfected children.the most common symptom is a lump or swelling in the abdomen, which can be painful. other possible symptoms include weight loss, a loss of appetite, feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting).a variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a liver tumour.anultrasound scanandx-rayswill be taken, which can show if there is a tumour in the liver. further tests, includingct (computerised tomography) scansormri (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, will be done to find out the extent of the disease, both inside and outside the liver.blood testswill also be carried out.most hepatoblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas produce a protein that is released into the bloodstream. this protein is known as alpha-fetoprotein (afp). it’s possible to measure levels of afp in the blood, which can be a useful indicator of whether the liver tumour is responding to treatment or whether it may have come back after treatment. afp is also known as a tumour marker.any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.to assess the extent of the cancer, a grouping system called pretext (pre-treatment extent of disease) is used. it uses an mri scan to measure the amount of cancer in the liver at diagnosis. it’s also used to help establish the best treatment for each child.this grouping system is unique to liver tumours and is increasingly used all over the world.this grouping process is essential because liver tumours need to be removed surgically. grouping divides the liver into four surgical areas (sectors) and gives an indication of the kind of surgery that is needed to remove the tumour. grouping also helps doctors decide whether a liver transplant surgeon needs to be involved from the start or not.doctors also look at the extent of the spread of cancer beyond the liver.sometimes the tumour gets into the blood vessels that are entering or leaving the liver. this may affect the type of surgery needed to remove the tumour.sometimes the tumour spreads outside the liver and into the abdomen (tummy). the tumour cannot be removed completely.if the tumour spreads outside the liver through the bloodstream (metastatic disease), it usually goes to the lungs. about 1 in 5 children are found to have affected lungs when they are diagnosed. doctors use x-rays and ct or mri scans to assess whether the lungs are affected.the diagnosis is made by taking a sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy). this is done under a general anaesthetic. once the diagnosis and staging have been confirmed, plans for treatment will be made.for hepatoblastoma, the type of treatment will depend on the pretext staging and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease).pretext 1, 2 and 3 tumours are called ‘standard risk’. pretext 4 is called ‘high risk’ and includes tumours that have spread to other parts of the body.treatment is broadly similar for all pretext stages. chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) is given first. the aim of chemotherapy is to shrink the tumour in the liver and hopefully get rid of any metastatic tumours. surgery to remove any of the remaining tumour will take place after a few weeks of chemotherapy. further chemotherapy is usually given after surgery. your child’s doctor will give you more detailed information about the chemotherapy drugs and their side effects.for hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment is a little different.the role of chemotherapy is less certain and surgery is the main treatment. doctors usually recommend removing the tumour (if it’s small enough) at diagnosis. chemotherapy may be given afterwards. however in many situations the tumour is too large to remove at first, and so chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumour so that surgery can be done later.hepatocellular tumours don’t always respond to chemotherapy as well as hepatoblastomas. for this reason, other treatments, such as chemoembolisation and targeted treatments, may be used.this refers to the giving of drugs directly into the artery going into the liver. very occasionally, this may be used for hepatocellular cancer.targeted drugs are a group of treatments that work in a different way to conventional chemotherapy. some drugs may cause cancer cells to die directly. others act to cut off the blood supply to the tumour cells (antiangiogenesis drugs). some drugs, called multi-targeted agents, work in both ways.research is looking into how useful targeted treatments are on their own and in combination with chemotherapy. your child’s doctor may talk to you more about this research.all children, if they are able to, will have surgery following chemotherapy. if there’s cancer in the lungs, which hasn’t completely disappeared with the chemotherapy, the lungs will be operated on first. if the liver tumour can be surgically removed, the operation to do so will follow, usually a week or two later.if the tumour involves all 4 sectors of the liver (pretext 4), a liver transplant will be necessary. this is recommended for hepatoblastoma but only in particular circumstances for hepatocellular carcinoma. in a transplant, the whole liver is removed and replaced with a liver from another person.this will be discussed with you from the beginning, and you will be given the opportunity to think about donating half of your liver, or for your child to have a liver from a donor. the transplant team will be there to answer all of your questions. a liver transplant is only possible if all the cancer outside the liver has gone.treatment often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. side effects can include: feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss an increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness diarrhoeathe chemotherapy used to treat liver cancer can cause late side effects. these may include hearing problems, kidney problems and possibly heart problems. there will be a slightly increased risk of your child developing another type of cancer later in life. most children will develop some late effects and need to have some follow-up tests. your child’s doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects.if the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as a recurrence. it can come back in the liver or in other parts of the body. if the cancer comes back, often (before anything is seen on scans) the levels of alpha-fetoprotein (afp) in the child’s blood will start to rise again and reaches levels of over 100. small rises in afp can occur in the weeks after surgery, as the liver regenerates as much as it can.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancer. if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. written information is often provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.when the treatment ends, your child will have regular blood tests to measure the level of afp in the blood (if appropriate), as well as scans and chest x-rays. more than three quarters of children with hepatoblastoma are cured, and for children with small tumours that are confined to the liver, the outlook is even better. the outcome for hepatocellular carcinoma is not quite as good. the staff at the hospital can give you information about the likely outcome for your child.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",
       " 'Loss of libido': 'loss of libido (sex drive) is a common problem affecting up to 1 in 5 men – and even more women – at some point in their life.it’s often linked to professional and personal stress, or important life-changing events such as pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.however, an unexpected loss of libido – especially when it lasts for a long time or keeps returning – can also indicate an underlying personal, medical or lifestyle problem, which can be upsetting to both partners in a relationship.if you’re concerned about your libido, especially if your diminished sex drive distresses you or affects your relationship, make an appointment to see your gp to discuss any underlying causes and possible medical or psychological treatments.doctors at yournearest family planning clinic, integrated sexual health clinic, or contraceptive and sexual health (cash) clinic may also be able to help.in the meantime, you may find the following information useful. it explains some of the most common reasons for loss of libido.the first thing you should consider is whether you’re happy in your relationship. do you have any doubts or worries that may be the real reason for your loss of sexual desire?if you’ve been in a relationship for a long time, you may have become overfamiliar with your partner and feel a degree of erotic dissatisfaction. this is quite common and can have a negative effect on your sex drive.relationship problems are among the most common causes of loss of libido. for help and advice, you may find it useful to contact the relationship support charityrelationships scotland.another thing to consider is whether the problem is a performance issue that makes sex difficult or unfulfilling. for example, many men experience ejaculation problems orerectile dysfunction, and women can experience painful sex orvaginismus(when the muscles around the vagina tighten involuntarily before penetration). see your gp if these problems are an issue, as they’re often treatable.your gp may feel you will benefit from psychosexual counselling. this is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your loss of libido.stress, anxiety and exhaustion can be all-consuming and have a major impact on your happiness. if you feel you’re constantly tired, stressed or anxious, you may need to make some lifestyle changes or speak to your gp for advice.for more information and advice read aboutbeating stress at workand10 stress bustersdepressionis very different from simply feeling unhappy, miserable or fed up for a short while. it’s a serious illness where you may have feelings of extreme sadness that can last for a long time. these feelings are severe enough to interfere with your daily life, including your sex life.you’re probably depressed if you’re feeling low or hopeless, or you’ve lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy. in this case it’s really important to see your gp. they may feel you’ll benefit fromantidepressants.however, low sex drive can also be a side effect of many antidepressants. speak to your gp if you’re already taking antidepressants and think they may be causing your problems, as you may be able to switch to a different medication.drinking excess amounts of alcohol can reduce your sex drive, so it’s a good idea to moderate your intake to no more than three to four units a day if you’re a man, and no more than two to three units a day if you’re a woman.read more aboutalcohol misuseand find out how to getsupport for a drinking problem.drug misuse is also linked to a loss of sex drive. read more aboutdrugsfor information and advice.many people lose some interest in sex as they get older, mainly as a result of falling levels of sex hormones, age-related health problems, or the side effects of medication.older men especially can develop low testosterone levels, which can cause fatigue, depression and a reduced sex drive.speak to your gp if you’re concerned about this. they may carry out ablood testto check your testosterone level and can tell you about treatments if your level is low.as women start to approach themenopause, levels of the female hormone oestrogen begin to fall, which can affect libido. women can also suffer from low testosterone levels, especially after ahysterectomy. testosterone is another hormone that can affect sex drive.speak to your gp if you’re concerned the menopause may be having an effect on your libido. they may be able to offer you a trial ofhormone replacement therapy (hrt)if it’s suitable for you.less commonly, low libido may be caused by anunderactive thyroid. this is where your thyroid gland (located in the neck) doesn’t produce enough hormones. common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed.an underactive thyroid is easily treated by taking hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn’t making. learn more abouttreating underactive thyroid.a hormonal problem called hyperprolactinaemia can also have a negative effect on your sex drive. this is where you have a raised level of a substance called prolactin in your blood.some women have reported a decreased sex drive while using some types of hormonal contraception, such as:however, side effects of these contraceptives tend to improve within a few months and they’re generally well tolerated.speak to your gp orlocal contraceptive (or family planning) clinicif you’re worried your contraception is causing a loss of libido. they may suggest trying an alternative method.read more aboutchoosing a method of contraceptionlong-term (chronic) medical conditions such ascardiovascular disease,diabetesandobesitycan also have a negative effect on your libido.certain medications can sometimes reduce libido, such as: medication for high blood pressure, including diuretics medications for depression, includingssri antidepressants medications for seizures (fits) medications commonly used to treatpsychosis(a mental condition where a person can’t distinguish between reality and their imagination), such as haloperidol, as well as many other conditions medicines such as cimetidine, finasteride and cyproterone, which block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone',\n",
       " 'Lung cancer': 'lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer.there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition eventually develop symptoms including: a persistent cough coughing up blood persistent breathlessness unexplained tiredness and weight loss an ache or pain when breathing or coughingyou should speak to your gp if you have these symptoms.read more about thesymptoms of lung cancercancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. this page is about primary lung cancer.there are 2 main types of primary lung cancer. these are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts. they are: non-small-cell lung cancer – the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases; can be either squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma small-cell lung cancer – a less common type that usually spreads faster than non-small-cell lung cancerthe type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended.read more aboutdiagnosing lung cancerlung cancer mainly affects older people. it’s rare in people younger than 40, and the rates of lung cancer rise sharply with age. lung cancer is most commonly diagnosed in people aged 70 to 74.although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the main cause (accounting for over 85% of cases). this is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances.read more about: causes of lung cancer preventing lung cancertreatment depends on the type of cancer, how far it’s spread and how good your general health is.if the condition is diagnosed

cancermost cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking, although people who have never smoked can also develop the condition.smoking cigarettes is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer. it’s responsible for more than 85% of all cases.tobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which can lead to the development of cancer. these substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing).if you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker.while smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such asoesophageal cancerandmouth cancer. these products include: cigars pipe tobacco snuff (a powdered form of tobacco) chewing tobaccosmoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco. while they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer.it’s been estimated that smoking 4 joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes.even smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. this is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer.if you don’t smoke, frequent exposure to other people’s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer.for example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner.radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. it can sometimes be found in buildings.if radon is breathed in, it can damage your lungs, particularly if you’re a smoker.exposure to certain chemicals and substances used in several occupations and industries has been linked to a slightly higher risk of developing lung cancer. these chemicals and substances include: arsenic asbestos beryllium cadmium coal and coke fumes silica nickelread more information aboutasbestosisand silicosis.research also suggests that being exposed to large amounts of diesel fumes for many years may increase your risk of developing lung cancer by up to 50%. one study has shown that your risk of developing lung cancer increases by about a third if you live in an area with high levels of nitrogen oxide gases (mostly produced by cars and other vehicles).read further information about thecauses and risk factors for lung cancerspeak to your gp if you havesymptoms of lung cancer, such as breathlessness or a persistent cough.your gp will ask about your general health and what symptoms you’ve been experiencing. they may examine you and ask you to breathe into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air you breathe in and out.you may be asked to have ablood testto rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms, such as achest infection.in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) publishedguidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of lung cancerand refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected lung cancer.a chestx-rayis usually the first test used to diagnose lung cancer. most lung tumours show up on x-rays as a white-grey mass.however, chest x-rays can’t give a definitive diagnosis because they often can’t distinguish between cancer and other conditions, such as a lung abscess (a collection of pus that forms in the lungs).if your chest x-ray suggests you may have lung cancer, you should be referred to a specialist (if you haven’t already) in chest conditions such as lung cancer. a specialist can carry out more tests to investigate whether you have lung cancer and, if you do, what type it is and how much it’s spread.acomputerised tomography (ct) scanis usually carried out after a chest x-ray. a ct scan uses x-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of your body.before having a ct scan, you’ll be given an injection of a contrast medium. this is a liquid containing a dye that makes the lungs show up more clearly on the scan. the scan is painless and takes 10 to 30 minutes to complete.a pet-ct scan (which stands for positron emission tomography-computerised tomography) may be carried out if the results of the ct scan show you have cancer at an early stage.the pet-ct scan can show where there are active cancer cells. this can help with diagnosis and treatment.before having a pet-ct scan, you’ll be injected with a slightly radioactive material. you’ll be asked to lie down on a table, which slides into the pet scanner. the scan is painless and takes around 30 to 60 minutes.if the ct scan shows there might be cancer in the central part of your chest, you’ll have a bronchoscopy. a bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor or nurse to remove a small sample of cells from inside your lungs.during a bronchoscopy, a thin tube called a bronchoscope is used to examine your lungs and take a sample of cells (biopsy). the bronchoscope is passed through your mouth or nose, down your throat and into the airways of your lungs.the procedure may be uncomfortable, but you’ll be given a mild sedative beforehand to help you relax and alocal anaestheticto make your throat numb. the procedure is very quick and only takes a few minutes.if you’re not able to have one of the biopsies described above, or you’ve had one and the results weren’t clear, you may be offered a different type of biopsy. this may be a type of surgical biopsy such as a thoracoscopy or a mediastinoscopy, or a biopsy carried out using a needle inserted through your skin.a percutaneous needle biopsy involves removing a sample from a suspected tumour to test it at a laboratory for cancerous cells.the doctor carrying out the biopsy will use a ct scanner to guide a needle to the site of a suspected tumour through the skin. a local anaesthetic is used to numb the surrounding skin, and the needle is passed through your skin and into your lungs. the needle will then be used to remove a sample of tissue for testing.a thoracoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to examine a particular area of your chest and take tissue and fluid samples.you’re likely to need ageneral anaestheticbefore having a thoracoscopy. two or three small cuts will be made in your chest to pass a tube (similar to a bronchoscope) into your chest. the doctor will use the tube to look inside your chest and take samples. the samples will then be sent away for tests.after a thoracoscopy, you may need to stay in hospital overnight while any further fluid in your lungs is drained out.a mediastinoscopy allows the doctor to examine the area between your lungs at the centre of your chest (mediastinum).for this test, you’ll need to have a general anaesthetic and stay in hospital for a couple of days. the doctor will make a small cut at the bottom of your neck so they can pass a thin tube into your chest.the tube has a camera at the end, which enables the doctor to see inside your chest. they’ll also be able to take samples of your cells and lymph nodes at the same time. the lymph nodes are tested because they’re usually the first place that lung cancer spreads to.once tests have been completed, it should be possible to work out what stage your cancer is, what this means for your treatment and whether it’s possible to completely cure the cancer.non-small-cell lung cancer (the most common type) usually spreads more slowly than small-cell lung cancer and responds differently to treatment.the cancer is contained within the lung and hasn’t spread to nearby lymph nodes. stage 1 can also be divided into two sub-stages: stage 1a – the tumour is less than 3cm in size (1.2 inches) stage 1b – the tumour is 3-5cm (1.2-2 inches)stage 2 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 2a and 2b.in stage 2a lung cancer, either: the tumour is 5 to 7cm the tumour is less than 5cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodesin stage 2b lung cancer, either: the tumour is larger than 7cm the tumour is 5 to 7cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes the cancer hasn’t spread to lymph nodes, but has spread to surrounding muscles or tissue the cancer has spread to one of the main airways (bronchus) the cancer has caused the lung to collapse there are multiple small tumours in the lungstage 3 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 3a and 3b.in stage 3a lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or into the surrounding tissue. this can be: the covering of the lung (the pleura) the chest wall the middle of the chest other lymph nodes near the affected lungin stage 3b lung cancer, the cancer has spread to either of the following: lymph nodes on either side of the chest, above the collarbones another important part of the body, such as the gullet (oesophagus), windpipe (trachea), heart or into a main blood vesselin stage 4 lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to both lungs or to another part of the body (such as the bones, liver or brain), or the cancer has caused fluid-containing cancer cells to build up around your heart or lungs.small-cell lung cancer is less common than non-small-cell lung cancer. the cancerous cells responsible for the condition are smaller in size when examined under a microscope than the cells that cause non-small-cell lung cancer.small-cell lung cancer only has 2 possible stages: limited disease – the cancer has not spread beyond the lung extensive disease – the cancer has spread beyond the lungcancer research uk has further information ontypes of lung cancer.treatment for lung cancer is carried out by a team of specialists who will work together to provide the best possible treatment.this team contains all the specialists required to make a proper diagnosis, to stage your cancer and to plan the best treatment. if you want to know more, ask your specialist about this.the type of treatment you’ll receive for lung cancer depends on several factors, including: the type of lung cancer you have (non-small-cell or small-cell cancer) the size and position of the cancer how far advanced your cancer is (the stage) your overall healthdeciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.the main treatment options include surgery,radiotherapyandchemotherapy. depending on your type of cancer and how advanced it is, you may receive a combination of these treatments.your treatment plan depends on whether you have non-small-cell lung cancer or small-cell lung cancer.if you have non-small-cell lung cancer that’s confined to one lung and you’re in good general health, you’ll probably have surgery to remove the cancerous cells. this may be followed by a course of chemotherapy to destroy any cancer cells that may have remained in the body.if the cancer hasn’t spread too far but surgery isn’t possible (for example, if your general health means you have an increased risk of developing complications), radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells will usually be recommended. in some cases, this may be combined with chemotherapy (known as chemoradiotherapy).if the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually recommended. if the cancer starts to grow again after initial chemotherapy treatment, another course of treatment may be recommended.in some cases, a treatment called biological or targeted therapy may be recommended as an alternative to chemotherapy, or after chemotherapy. biological therapies are medications that can control or stop the growth of cancer cells.small-cell lung cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy, either on its own or in combination with radiotherapy. this can help to prolong life and relieve symptoms.surgery isn’t usually used to treat this type of lung cancer. this is because the cancer has often already spread to other areas of the body by the time it’s diagnosed. however, if the cancer is found very early, surgery may be used. in these cases, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.there are 3  types of lung cancer surgery: lobectomy – where one or more large parts of the lung (called lobes) are removed – your doctors will suggest this operation if the cancer is just in 1 section of 1 lung pneumonectomy – where the entire lung is removed – this is used when the cancer is located in the middle of the lung or has spread throughout the lung wedge resection or segmentectomy – where a small piece of the lung is removed (this procedure is only suitable for a small number of patients, as it is only used if your doctors think your cancer is small and limited to one area of the lung – this is usually very early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer)people are naturally concerned that they won’t be able to breathe if some or all of a lung is removed, but it’s possible to breathe normally with 1 lung. however, if you have breathing problems before the operation, such as breathlessness, it’s likely that these symptoms will continue after surgery.before surgery can take place, you’ll need to have a number of tests to check your general state of health and your lung function. these may include: anelectrocardiogram (ecg)– electrodes are used to monitor the electrical activity of your heart spirometry – you’ll breathe into a machine called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can breathe in and outsurgery is usually performed by making a cut (incision) in your chest or side, and removing a section or all of the affected lung. nearby lymph nodes may also be removed if it’s thought that the cancer may have spread to them.in some cases, an alternative to this approach, called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (vats), may be suitable. vats is a type of keyhole surgery, where small incisions are made in the chest. a small fibre-optic camera is inserted into one of the incisions, so the surgeon can see images of the inside of your chest on a monitor.you’ll probably be able to go home 5 to 10 days after your operation. however, it can take many weeks to recover fully from a lung operation.after your operation, you’ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. even if you have to stay in bed, you’ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots from forming. a physiotherapist will show you breathing exercises to help prevent complications.when you go home, you’ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. walking and swimming are good forms of exercise that are suitable for most people after treatment for lung cancer. talk to your care team about which types of exercise are suitable for you.as with all surgery, lung surgery carries a risk of complications. these are estimated to occur in 1 out in 5 cases. these complications can usually be treated using medication or additional surgery, which may mean you need to stay in hospital for longer.complications of lung surgery can include: inflammation or infection of the lung (pneumonia) excessive bleeding a blood clot in the leg (deep vein thrombosis), which could potentially travel up to the lung (pulmonary embolism)radiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses pulses of radiation to destroy cancer cells. there are a number of ways it can be used to treat people with lung cancer.an intensive course of radiotherapy, known as radical radiotherapy, can be used to try to cure non-small-cell lung cancer if the person isn’t healthy enough for surgery. for very small tumours, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery.radiotherapy can also be used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn’t possible (this is known as palliative radiotherapy).a type of radiotherapy known as prophylactic cranial irradiation (pci) is also sometimes used during the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. pci involves treating the whole brain with a low dose of radiation. it’s used as a preventative measure because there’s a risk that small-cell lung cancer will spread to your brain.the 3 main ways that radiotherapy can be given are described below: conventional external beam radiotherapy – a machine is used to direct beams of radiation at affected parts of your body stereotactic radiotherapy – a more accurate type of external beam radiotherapy where several high-energy beams are used to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumour, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue as much as possible internal radiotherapy – a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into your lung – a small piece of radioactive material is placed inside the catheter and positioned against the site of the tumour before being removed after a few minutesfor lung cancer, external beam radiotherapy is used more often than internal radiotherapy, particularly if it’s thought that a cure is possible. stereotactic radiotherapy may be used to treat tumours that are very small, as it’s more effective than standard radiotherapy alone in these circumstances.internal radiotherapy only tends to be used as a palliative treatment when the cancer is blocking or partly blocking your airway.a course of radiotherapy treatment can be planned in several different ways.radical radiotherapy is usually given 5 days a week, with a break at weekends. each session of radiotherapy lasts 10 to 15 minutes and the course usually lasts 4 to 7 weeks.continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (chart) is an alternative method of delivering radical radiotherapy. chart is given 3 times a day for 12 days in a row.for stereotactic radiotherapy, fewer treatment sessions are needed because a higher dose of radiation is delivered with each treatment. people having conventional radical radiotherapy are likely to have around 20 to 32 treatment sessions, whereas stereotactic radiotherapy typically only requires anything from 3 to 10 sessions.palliative radiotherapy usually only requires 1 to 5 sessions to control your symptoms.side effects of radiotherapy to the chest include: chest pain fatigue persistentcoughthat may bring up blood-stained phlegm (this is normal and nothing to worry about) difficulties swallowing (dysphagia) redness and soreness of the skin, which looks and feels like sunburn hair loss on your chestside effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has been completed.chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medication to treat cancer. there are several different ways that chemotherapy can be used to treat lung cancer. for example, it can be: given before surgery to shrink a tumour, which can increase the chance of successful surgery (this is usually only done as part of a clinical trial) given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning used to relieve symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn’t possible combined with radiotherapychemotherapy treatments are usually given in cycles. a cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to let your body recover from the effects of the treatment.the number of cycles of chemotherapy you need will depend on the type and the grade of your lung cancer. most people require four to 6 courses of treatment over 3 to 6 months.chemotherapy for lung cancer involves taking a combination of different medications. the medications are usually delivered through a drip into a vein (intravenously), or into a tube connected to one of the blood vessels in your chest. some people may be given capsules or tablets to swallow instead.side effects of chemotherapy can include: fatigue nausea vomiting mouth ulcers hair lossthese side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished, or you may be able to take other medicines to make you feel better during your chemotherapy.chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. tell your care team or gp as soon as possible if you have possible signs of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) of 38c (100.4f) or more, or you suddenly feel generally unwell.as well as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there are a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to treat lung cancer.biological therapies are newer medications. they’re sometimes recommended as an alternative treatment to chemotherapy for non-small-cell cancer that has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective.examples of biological therapies include erlotinib and gefitinib. these are also called growth factor inhibitors because they work by disrupting the growth of the cancer cells.biological therapies are only suitable for people who have certain proteins in their cancerous cells. your doctor may be able to request tests on a small sample of cells removed from your lung (biopsy) to determine whether these treatments are likely to be suitable for you.radiofrequency ablation is a new type of treatment that can treat non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed at an early stage.the doctor carrying out the treatment uses acomputerised tomography (ct) scannerto guide a needle to the site of the tumour. the needle will be pressed into the tumour and radio waves will be sent through the needle. these waves generate heat, which kills the cancer cells.the most common complication of radiofrequency ablation is that a pocket of air gets trapped between the inner and outer layer of your lungs (pneumothorax). this can be treated by placing a tube into the lungs to drain away the trapped air.cryotherapy is a treatment that can be used if the cancer starts to block your airways. this is known as endobronchial obstruction, and it can cause symptoms such as: breathing problems a cough coughing up bloodcryotherapy is performed in a similar way to internal radiotherapy, except that instead of using a radioactive source, a device known as a cryoprobe is placed against the tumour. the cryoprobe can generate very cold temperatures, which help to shrink the tumour.photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a treatment that can be used to treat early-stage lung cancer when a person is unable or unwilling to have surgery. it can also be used to remove a tumour that’s blocking the airways.photodynamic therapy is carried out in 2 stages. firstly, you’ll be given an injection of a medication that makes the cells in your body very sensitive to light.the next stage is carried out 24 to 72 hours later. a thin tube will be guided to the site of the tumour, and a laser will be beamed through it. the cancerous cells, which are now more sensitive to light, will be destroyed by the laser beam.side effects of photodynamic therapy can include inflammation of the airways and a build-up of fluid in the lungs. both these side effects can cause symptoms of breathlessness and lung and throat pain. however, these symptoms should gradually pass as your lungs recover from the effects of the treatment.breathlessness is common in people who have lung cancer, whether it is a symptom of the condition or a side effect of treatment.in many cases, breathlessness can be improved with some simple measures such as: breathing in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth (after treatment for lung cancer, you may see a physiotherapist, who can teach you some simple breathing exercises) making daily activities easier – for example, using a trolley when you go shopping or keeping things you often need downstairs so you don’t need to regularly walk up and down the stairs using a fan to direct cool air towards your face eating smaller and more frequent meals, and taking smaller mouthfulsif measures like these aren’t enough to control your breathlessness, you may need further treatment. there are a number of medications that can help improve breathlessness. home oxygen treatment may be an option in more severe cases.if your breathlessness is caused by another condition, such as a chest infection or a fluid build-up around the lungs (a pleural effusion), treating this underlying cause may help your breathing.read further information: macmillan cancer support: managing breathlessness cancer research uk: coping with

       " 'Lupus': \"lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening.there are some types of lupus that just affect the skin – such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects.however, the term “lupus” is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs.symptoms range from mild to severe, and many people will have long periods with few or no symptoms before experiencing a sudden flare-up, where their symptoms are particularly severe.even mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person’s quality of life.the rest of this article will focus on sle.sle can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. the most common symptoms are: fatigue (extreme tiredness) rashes – particularly on the face, wrists and hands joint pain and swellingas the symptoms of sle can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose.if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by sle, you should see your gp so they can try to determine the cause.read more about thesymptoms of lupusanddiagnosing lupus.sle is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. for reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with sle starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs.as with other more common autoimmune conditions, such asrheumatoid arthritis, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors may be responsible for triggering sle in certain people.read more about thecauses of lupus.sle is an uncommon condition where around 90% of cases occur in women. the condition is most common in women of childbearing age (between the ages of 15 and 50), but it can also affect people of other ages.the condition tends to be less common in people of white european origin and more common in those of african, caribbean or asian origin.there is currently no cure for sle, but there are different medications that can help relieve many of the symptoms and reduce the chances of organ damage.these medications include: hydroxychloroquine – a medicine that has historically been used to treatmalaria, but can also help treat some symptoms of sle corticosteroids– anti-inflammatory medications immunosuppressants – a group of medicines that suppress your immune systemwith good levels of support from friends, family and healthcare professionals, many people with sle are able to manage their condition effectively.read more abouttreating lupus.a few decades ago sle was regarded as a terminal condition, as many people would die of an associated complication within a few years of being diagnosed.as a result of early diagnosis and advances in treatment, however, the outlook for sle is now much better. the vast majority of people diagnosed with the condition will have a normal or near-normal life expectancy.however, some people with sle are still at risk of life-threatening complications as a result of damage to internal organs and tissues, such asheart attackorstroke. sle, and some of the treatments for it, can also increase your risk of developing potentially serious infections.read more about thecomplications of lupus.symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) can vary widely from person to person. some people may only experience a few mild symptoms, whereas others may be more severely affected.even if you usually have mild symptoms, sle can “flare-up”, with symptoms becoming more severe or new symptoms developing.the 3 main symptoms of sle are fatigue, joint pain and rashes.fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of sle. you may feel very tired even though you get plenty of sleep. carrying out everyday tasks, such as housework or office work, can leave you feeling exhausted.many people with sle find that fatigue is the most distressing and disruptive aspect of sle because it has a negative impact on their work and social life.if you have sle, you are likely to experience joint pain in your hands and feet. you may find the pain changes from one set of joints to another quite quickly, and is usually worse in the morning.unlike some other conditions that affect the joints, sle is unlikely to cause your joints to become permanently damaged or deformed.many people with sle develop rashes on their skin – most commonly on the face, wrists and hands. a rash over the cheeks and the bridge of the nose is particularly common and is known as a “butterfly rash” or “malar rash”.rashes caused by sle may get better after a few days or weeks, but can last longer or even be permanent.rashes caused by sle can sometimes be itchy or painful, and they may get worse if they are exposed to sunlight. this is known as “photosensitivity”.sle can also cause a wide range of symptoms. however, you’re unlikely to have all of the symptoms listed below, and many people with the condition will only experience the main symptoms.other features of sle may include: a fever (high temperature) swollen lymph glands(small glands found throughout your body, including in your neck, armpits and groin) recurringmouth ulcers hair loss (alopecia) high blood pressure(hypertension) headachesandmigraines stomach (abdominal) pain chest pain depression dry eyes memory loss seizures (fits) problems thinking clearly and difficulty telling the difference between reality and imagination (psychosis) shortness of breath raynaud’s phenomenon a condition that limits the blood supply to your hands and feet when it is cold ankle swelling and fluid retention (oedema)you should see your gp if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by sle.while it is likely that your symptoms are being caused by a more common condition, it is important to see a doctor for a diagnosis.read more aboutdiagnosing lupus.systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system.the immune system is the body’s natural defence against illness and infection. when the immune system detects the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria or a virus, it sends white blood cells and antibodies to attack it.in cases of sle, antibodies released by the immune system can attack healthy tissue, cells and organs.it’s not clear exactly why this happens, although most experts think sle has more than one cause. it has been suggested that there may be a number of genetic factors that make people more susceptible to the condition, and that it also takes one or more environmental factors to trigger sle in those who are susceptible.possible genetic and environmental factors are discussed in more detail below.brothers and sisters of people with sle are much more likely to develop the condition than the population at large.researchers have identified a number of different genetic mutations that seem to make people more susceptible to developing sle. a genetic mutation occurs when normal instructions carried in certain genes become “scrambled”, resulting in the body’s processes not working normally.most faulty genes are associated with regulating certain functions of the immune system, which may explain why the immune system in people with sle starts to malfunction.a number of environmental factors may be responsible for triggering sle in vulnerable individuals, although the evidence for many of these is limited.possible environmental factors that have been suggested include: exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet light) hormonal changes that occur during a woman’s lifetime, such as during puberty or pregnancy certain infections, such as by the epstein-barr virus (ebv) – a common viral infection that doesn’t usually cause any symptoms smokingsystemic lupus erythematosus (sle) can be difficult to diagnose, as it has similar symptoms to several other, far more common, conditions.diagnosis may also be difficult because symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and they may change over time. for example, there may be periods where your symptoms are not very noticeable, or times when they flare up and become more severe.for a confident diagnosis of sle to be made, you will need to have severalsymptoms of lupusand a number ofblood testsmay need to be carried out.some of the blood tests that may be carried out are described below.a blood test called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) test can be used to determine whether there is any inflammation in your body.this can be useful in diagnosing sle because the condition can cause many areas of the body to become inflamed (swell), including the joints and internal organs.the test works by measuring how long it takes for red blood cells to fall to the bottom of a test tube. the quicker they fall, the more likely it is that there are high levels of inflammation.an anti-nuclear antibody test checks whether there is a certain type of antibody cell in your blood, known as the anti-nuclear antibody. approximately 95% of people with sle have this antibody.however, it is possible to have the anti-nuclear antibody without having sle, so the anti-nuclear antibody test is not a definitive way of testing for the condition. other blood tests will also be needed to confirm the diagnosis.an anti-dna test also checks for a certain type of antibody in your blood, known as the anti-dna antibody. if you have the anti-dna antibody, it is highly likely that you have sle. however, the antibody is only found in around 70% of people with the condition.the level of anti-dna antibodies increases when sle is more active, so during a flare-up of symptoms your reading from this test may be greater than normal.complement is a chemical in the blood that forms part of your immune system. the level of this chemical may be tested to check how active your sle is. the level of complement in your blood decreases when sle is more active.once you have been diagnosed with sle, you will normally need regular monitoring to see how the condition is affecting your body.if you have sle it is possible you may develop other conditions, such as kidney problems. monitoring your condition will allow your doctor to check for these complications and, if necessary, treat them as soon as possible.you may need to have scans, such as anx-ray,ultrasound scan,magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanor acomputerised tomography (ct) scanto check whether sle is affecting your internal organs.read more about thecomplications of lupus.there is currently no cure for systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), but treatments that can ease the symptoms and make it easier to live with are available.in most cases, treatment will involve a combination of self-care measures and medication.exposure to sunlight can sometimes make symptoms such as rashes worse, and it’s important to protect your skin when in the sun.this means wearing clothing that covers your skin, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. you will also need to apply sunscreen with a high spf to prevent sunburn. however, some people with lupus are not sun-sensitive and do not need to take extra precautions.as people get most of their vitamin d as a result of direct sunlight on the skin, there is a risk you may not get enough of this vitamin if you need to avoid sun exposure. this means you may need to make an extra effort to include good sources of vitamin d in your diet to avoid problems such asosteoporosis(weakened bones), and you may be advised to take vitamin d supplements.non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)are a common painkilling medication that reduces inflammation in the body. if you experience joint or muscle pain as a result of sle, you may be prescribed a nsaid to help ease your symptoms.commonly prescribed nsaids for sle includeibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac.you can buy some nsaids, such as ibuprofen, over the counter. these nsaids may be suitable if your joint or muscle pain is mild. for more severe pain, you will need stronger medication prescribed by your gp.nsaids may not be suitable for people who have stomach, kidney or liver problems, or have had these problems in the past. they may also be unsuitable for people with asthma. your gp will advise about which nsaid is right for you.if taken in high doses or over long periods of time, nsaids can damage your stomach lining, which may cause internal bleeding.if you need to take nsaids on a long-term basis, your gp will carefully monitor you to check for any problems, and you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) to protect your stomach.hydroxychloroquine is a medicine that has been used to treatmalaria, but is also effective in treating some of the symptoms of sle, such as rashes, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue.you will usually have to take hydroxychloroquine for 6 to 12 weeks before you notice any benefit.most expert doctors recommend people with sle take hydroxychloroquine on a long-term basis as a way of controlling their symptoms, helping to prevent flare-ups and to prevent development of more serious problems from lupus.side effects of hydroxychloroquine are uncommon, but may includeindigestion,diarrhoea,headachesand rashes.hydroxychloroquine may also cause more serious side effects in a small number of people. for example, in rare cases, this medicine can cause eye damage. contact your gp or specialist immediately if you experience vision problems while taking hydroxychloroquine.if your gp or specialist feels it is necessary, you may need regular eye examinations.corticosteroidsare a type of medicine that help reduce inflammation quickly. they can be very effective in treating symptoms of sle, but are usually only prescribed if the condition is severe.if you have severe symptoms of sle, or if you are experiencing a flare-up, you may be given a large dose of corticosteroids to help bring your symptoms under control. as your symptoms ease, your dosage can gradually be reduced.when prescribing corticosteroids, the lowest effective dosage is always given. this is because high doses or long-term use of corticosteroids can cause side effects. these may include: thinning of your bones thinning of your skin weight gain high blood pressure(hypertension)corticosteroids are a safe and effective form of treatment, provided they are taken correctly and under the supervision of your gp or specialist. they will tailor the steroid dose to your disease activity, to minimise side effects while effectively controlling the condition.immunosuppressants are a type of medicine that suppress your immune system. they can help improve your symptoms of sle by limiting the damage your immune system causes when it attacks healthy parts of your body.commonly prescribed immunosuppressant medicines include azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide.immunosuppressants are sometimes used in conjunction with corticosteroids (see above) because these medicines may ease your symptoms more effectively when used together. alternatively, the use of immunosuppressant medication may allow your corticosteroid dose to be reduced.immunosuppressant medication is usually only prescribed if you have severe sle. this is because this type of medication is powerful and can cause side effects such as: loss of appetite vomiting diarrhoea swollen gums bruising or bleeding more easily headache acne extra hair growth weight gain liver damage an increased risk of infection (see below)methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide can also cause birth defects if they are taken during pregnancy, so you should use a reliable form of contraception if you are taking these medications and are sexually active. if you are trying to become pregnant, an alternative medication such as azathioprine can be used.tell your gp if a side effect becomes particularly troublesome, as it may mean your dose needs to be adjusted.taking immunosuppressant medication can increase your risk of developing an infection. this is a particularly serious concern for people with sle, because the organ damage that can occur as a result of the condition means infections are more likely to be life-threatening.it is therefore very important to report any symptoms of a possible infection to your gp immediately.symptoms of infection may sometimes be similar to a flare up of sle and include: a fever (high temperature) acoughorbreathlessness burning when passing urine or passing blood in your urine diarrhoeayou should also try to avoid contact with anyone known to have an infection – even if it is an infection you were previously immune to, such aschickenpoxormeasles. this is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered).rituximab is a new type of medication used in people with severe sle that doesn’t respond to other treatments.rituximab was originally designed to treat certain types of cancer, such aslymphoma, but it has since proved effective in treating a number of autoimmune conditions, such as sle andrheumatoid arthritis.rituximab works by locking on to and killing cells called “b-cells”, which produce antibodies responsible for the symptoms of sle. it is administered directly into your vein over the course of several hours, known as an infusion.rituximab is not currently licensed for treating sle in the uk, but your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. if your doctor suggests using rituximab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe it is in treating sle.common side effects of rituximab include: flu-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature dizziness vomitingin rare cases, rituximab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.belimumab is a new medication given to people with active sle who don’t respond to other treatments.it works by binding to growth factors that are needed for the survival of b-cells. it is given directly into your vein over several hours, known as an infusion. the first 3 doses are given 14 days apart, and the medication is usually given once a month thereafter.belimumab is licensed for treating sle in the uk, and there may be instances where your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. if your doctor suggests using belimumab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe it is in treating sle.common side effects of belimumab include: flu-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature nausea and diarrhoea headache difficulty sleeping (insomnia) a cough,sore throatand blocked or runny nose joint pain increased risk of infections changes in blood pressurein rare cases, belimumab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.if your symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) are mild or well-controlled, you may find it barely affects your day-to-day life and that you do not have any complications.however, for some people, sle can be a more serious condition that can cause life-threatening complications. some of these complications are outlined below.around 1 in every 3 people with sle will develop a potentially serious kidney disease called lupus nephritis, which is caused by prolonged inflammation of the kidneys.lupus nephritis tends to develop relatively early in the course of sle, usually within five years of diagnosis.symptoms of lupus nephritis can include: swelling of your feet (oedema) headaches dizziness blood in your urine a frequent need to urinatelupus nephritis can also causehigh blood pressure(hypertension). if left untreated, it can put you at risk of developing life-threatening problems such as aheart attackorstroke.in many cases, lupus nephritis does not cause any noticeable symptoms. however, this does not mean the condition is not dangerous, as the kidneys could still be being damaged.if you have sle, it is likely you will need to have regularblood testsso the condition of your kidneys can be carefully monitored. if you develop lupus nephritis, it can usually be successfully controlled using immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide.in a small number of cases, the kidney damage can become severe enough to require treatment withdialysis(where a machine is used to replicates many of the kidneys’ functions) or a kidney transplant.cardiovascular disease (cvd)is a general term for any type of health condition that affects the heart and arteries. it is often associated with blood clots and atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries).examples of cvd includecoronary heart disease,angina(chest pain caused by the heart not receiving enough blood), heart attack and stroke.people with sle are more likely to develop cvd than the general population, because sle can cause your heart and arteries to become inflamed and damaged.if you have sle, you can reduce your risk of cvd by making health lifestyle chances, such as: stopping smokingif you smoke eating a healthy, balanced dietlow in saturated fat, sugar and salt, and containing at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day maintaining a healthy weight exercising regularly– at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) a week of exercise strenuous enough to leave you slightly out of breath is recommended cutting down on your alcohol consumptionsle does not usually affect fertility, but it can increase your risk of experiencing pregnancy complications, such as: pre-eclampsia(a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy) premature delivery miscarriage stillbirthsome children of women with sle can also be born withheart block(where electrical pulses that control the beating of the heart are disrupted) and rashes. this is known as “neonatal lupus syndrome”.if you have sle and are thinking of having a baby, it is best to plan this carefully with your doctors if possible. the risk of complications is higher if you become pregnant during periods where your symptoms are particularly severe, so you will usually be advised to try to avoid getting pregnant until your symptoms are better controlled.if you do become pregnant, you will need to be monitored closely by your specialist and by an obstetrician, so they can check for any problems. arthritis sjogren's syndrome lupus uk\",\n",
       " 'Lyme disease': 'learn about the symptoms, causes, treatment, and when to speak to your gp.lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. it’s also known as lyme borreliosis.ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and moorland areas. they feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans.lyme disease is usually easier to treat the earlier it’s diagnosed.many people with early symptoms of lyme disease develop a circular rash around thetick bite. the rash:some people may develop several rashes in different parts of their body.around 1 in 3 people with lyme disease won’t develop a rash.some people with lyme disease also haveflu-like symptomsin the early stages, like: tiredness (fatigue) muscle pain joint pain headaches a high temperature (fever) chills neck stiffnessyou’ve been bitten by a tick and you: develop a rash have flu-like symptomsremember to tell them you’ve been bitten by a tick.more serious symptoms may develop if lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early. these can include: pain and swelling in the joints nerve problems – such as numbness or pain in your limbs memory problems difficulty concentrating heart problemssome of these problems will get better slowly with treatment. but they can persist if treatment is started late.a few people with lyme disease go on to develop long-term symptoms similar to those offibromyalgiaor chronic fatigue syndrome. this is known as post-infectious lyme disease. it’s not clear exactly why this happens. it’s likely to be related to overactivity of your immune system rather than continued infection.if a tick bites an animal carrying the bacteria that cause lyme disease, the tick can become infected. the tick can then transfer the bacteria to a human by biting them.ticks don’t jump or fly. they climb on to your clothes or skin if you brush against something they’re on. they then bite into the skin and start to feed on your blood.generally, you’re more likely to become infected if the tick is attached to your skin for more than 24 hours. ticks are very small and their bites are not painful, so you may not realise you have one attached to your skin.ticks are found throughout the uk and in other parts of europe and north america. there are a high number of ticks in the scottish highlands.they can be found in any areas with deep or overgrown plants where they have access to animals to feed on.they’re common in woodland and moorland areas, but can also be found in gardens or parks.the risk of getting lyme disease is higher: for people who spend time in woodland or moorland areas from march to october because more people take part in outdoor activitiesit’s thought only a small proportion of ticks carry the bacteria that cause lyme disease. being bitten doesn’t mean you’ll definitely be infected. however, it’s important to be aware of the risk and speak to a gp if you start to feel unwell.diagnosing lyme disease is often difficult as many of the symptoms are similar to other conditions.there are 2 kinds ofblood testuse to diagnose lyme disease. the tests are not always accurate in the early stages of lyme disease. so you may need tested more than once if you still have symptoms after a negative result.if you have symptoms of lyme disease, you’ll normally be givenantibiotics.if you’re prescribed antibiotics, it’s important you finish the course even if you’re feeling better. this’ll help ensure all the bacteria are killed. try to stick to hard paths wear long trousers in overgrown areas tuck your trousers into your socks wear insect repellent check for ticks on your body after walking or camping',\n",
       " 'Lymphoedema': 'lymphoedema is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes swelling in the body’s tissues. it can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs.other symptoms of lymphoedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them.lymphoedema can get worse if it’s not treated, so you should speak to a doctor if you think you may have the condition.read more about thesymptoms of lymphoedemaanddiagnosing lymphoedemalymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. this is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues.abnormal development of the lymphatic system, damage to it, and/or an increase in fluid in the body tissues can all lead to lymphoedema.there are two main types of lymphoedema: primary lymphoedema – caused by faulty genes affecting the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually occurs in early adulthood secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system, often due to an infection, injury,cancertreatment, inflammation of the limb or a lack of limb movementread more about thecauses of lymphoedemaa recent study has suggested that over 200,000 people in the uk may be living with lymphoedema.secondary lymphoedema has been shown to affect approximately one in five women afterbreast cancertreatment.primary lymphoedema is less common than secondary lymphoedema, and is estimated to affect around one in every 6,000 people.there is no cure for lymphoedema, but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system.these include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques.read more abouttreating lymphoedemaandpreventing lymphoedemathe build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection.in particular, a bacterial infection of the skin calledcellulitisis commonly reported in people with the condition.read more about thecomplications of lymphoedemathe main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, which can cause problems fitting into clothes, or jewellery and watches starting to feel tight.at first, the swelling may come and go. it may get worse during the day and then go down overnight. without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent.other symptoms in an affected body part can include: an aching, heavy feeling difficulty with movement repeated skin infections the skin becoming hard and tight folds developing in the skin wart-like growths developing on the skin a leakage of fluid through the skinwhen these symptoms start depends on what is causing the condition.if lymphoedema is caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body), the symptoms can develop at any age, but most commonly start during infancy, adolescence or early adulthood.in these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time – particularly the lower leg.if lymphoedema is caused by damage to the lymphatic system, the symptoms can develop at any time. for example, if your lymphatic system is damaged due to treatment forbreast cancer, lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years.read more about thecauses of lymphoedemaif you are at risk of developing lymphoedema because you have had treatment forcancer, you may be offered an assessment for the condition as part of your treatment aftercare plan. speak to your consultant or specialist nurse if you have any concerns.if you think you may have lymphoedema, but not as a result of treatment for cancer, see your gp.read more aboutdiagnosing lymphoedemathere are two types of lymphoedema, called primary and secondary lymphoedema, which have different causes.the main causes of primary and secondary lymphoedema are outlined below.primary lymphoedema is caused by alterations (known as mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that help fight infection and remove excess fluid from the body).these “faulty” genes result in the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining fluid not developing properly or not working as they should.primary lymphoedema usually runs in families, but not every child born to someone with the condition will develop it themselves.secondary lymphoedema develops in people who previously had a normal lymphatic system.it can have a number of different causes. some of the most common causes are explained below.cancercells can spread around the body through the lymphatic system, so part of the treatment for the condition can involve surgically removing sections of the lymphatic system potentially containing cancerous cells.although the surgeon will try to ensure limited damage to your lymphatic system, this isn’t always possible.there is a particular risk of lymphoedema occurring as a complication of treatment for: breast cancer melanoma skin cancer gynaecological cancers – such ascervical cancerandvulval cancer genitourinary cancers – such asprostate cancerorpenile cancerradiotherapyuses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous tissue, but it can also damage healthy tissue.if it’s necessary to use radiotherapy to destroy cancerous cells in your lymphatic system, there is a risk that the system could become permanently damaged and unable to drain fluid properly.in some cases, an infection can cause lymphoedema.cellulitisis a bacterial skin infection that can cause lymphoedema. severe cellulitis can damage the tissue around the lymphatic system, causing it to become scarred.another infectious cause of lymphoedema is a parasitic infection called filariasis. this is a common cause of lymphoedema worldwide, but is not a risk in the uk.conditions that cause tissue to become inflamed (red and swollen) can also permanently damage the lymphatic system. medical conditions that can cause lymphoedema include: rheumatoid arthritis– which causes pain and swelling in the joints eczema– which causes the skin to become itchy, reddened, dry and crackedvenous diseases, which affect the flow of blood through the veins, can cause lymphoedema in some people. the abnormal or damaged veins can result in excessive fluid leaking from the blood into the tissue spaces. this overwhelms and eventually exhausts the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining this fluid.some venous diseases that can lead to lymphoedema include: deep vein thrombosis (dvt)– a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body varicose veins(swollen and enlarged veins) – where poor drainage of blood in the veins causes higher vein pressure, and more fluid passes into the surrounding tissuespeople who are obese, particularly those who are severely obese, have an increased risk of developing lymphoedema. it’s not clear exactly why this is, but it has been suggested that the extra fatty tissue affects the lymphatic channels in some way, reducing the flow of fluid through them.in these cases, weight loss is an important part of treatment and even just starting to lose weight can make a big difference.in a small number of cases, lymphoedema can be caused by an accidental injury to the lymphatic system. for example, lymphoedema can sometimes occur after extensive soft tissue loss or bruising.movement and exercise helps lymph drainage, as muscle activity surrounding the lymphatic vessels massages fluid into and along them. therefore, reduced movement can lead to lymphoedema, because the fluid in the lymphatic system does not get moved on, causing swelling.for example, people who are unable to move fully for a long time due to an illness or surgery may be at risk of lymphoedema.if you’re being treated for cancer and are at risk of developing lymphoedema, you’ll be monitored for the condition afterwards. otherwise, see your gp if you experience symptoms of swelling.there are a number of specialist lymphoedema treatment centres in the uk. your doctor may refer you to one of these for further assessment. a list of treatment centres near you is available from the lymphoedema support network.in many cases, it’s possible to make a diagnosis of lymphoedema by: asking about your symptoms and medical history examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it’s enlargedalthough not necessary in most cases, further tests may occasionally be used to assess and monitor your condition. these tests are explained below.in some cases, tests to calculate the volume of an affected limb may be carried out. these may include: a tape measure to measure the circumference of the limb at certain intervals, to calculate its volume water displacement – where you place the affected limb in a tank of water and the amount of water that is displaced is measured to calculate the volume of the limb perometry – infrared light is used to measure the outline of an affected limb and calculate its volumeduring a bioimpedance test, electrodes (small metallic discs) are placed on different parts of your body. the electrodes release a small and painless electric charge that is measured using a handheld device. changes in the strength of the current can indicate the presence of fluid in your tissue.imaging tests may also be used to help diagnose and monitor lymphoedema. these include: a lymphoscintigraph – you are injected with a radioactive dye that can be tracked using a special scanner; this shows how the dye moves through your lymphatic system and can check for any blockages amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of your body anultrasound scan– which uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body acomputerised tomography (ct) scan– which usesx-raysand a computer to create detailed images of the lymph nodesthese scans can be used to create a clearer picture of the affected tissue.the recommended treatment for lymphoedema is decongestive lymphatic therapy (dlt).dlt is not a cure for lymphoedema, but it can help control the symptoms. although it takes time and effort, the treatment can be used to effectively control your lymphoedema.there are four components to dlt: compression bandages and garments – to move fluid out of the affected limb and minimise further build-up skin care – to keep the skin in good condition and reduce the chances of infection exercises – to use muscles in the affected limb to improve lymph drainage specialised massage techniques – known as manual lymphatic drainage (mld) – to stimulate the flow of fluid in the lymphatic system and reduce swellingeach of these components is described in more detail below.dlt usually begins with an intensive phase of therapy, during which you may receive daily treatment for several weeks to help reduce the volume of the affected body part.this is followed by the second phase, known as the maintenance phase. during this, you will be encouraged to take over your own care by carrying out simple self-massage techniques, wearing compression garments and continuing to exercise. this phase of treatment aims to maintain the reduced size of the affected body part.you may then have reviews every few months to check how your treatment is progressing.unlike the blood circulation system, there is no central pump, such as the heart, to move fluid around the lymphatic system. instead, the lymphatic system uses the massaging effect of surrounding muscles to move the fluid.if you have lymphoedema, you will have special bandages or garments (such as sleeves, gloves, stockings or tights) fitted over any affected limbs. these will support the affected muscles during exercise and encourage them to move fluid out of the affected limb.these may also be applied after a session of mld, to prevent fluid accumulating in the limb again. this use of compression bandages and garments is known as multilayer lymphoedema bandaging.velcro wraps may be used instead of bandages and have the advantage that the person with lymphoedema can apply them themselves.you will be taught how to correctly apply your own bandages and compression garments, so you can continue to use them during the maintenance period.taking good care of your skin is important, because it will reduce your risk of developing an infection, such ascellulitis.read our page onpreventing lymphoedemafor more skin care advice.your lymphoedema care team will help devise an exercise and movement plan designed to strengthen and stimulate the muscles involved in lymph drainage. they will also help you to lose weight, if you are overweight. this will be tailored to your requirements and ability.your plan may involve specific limb exercises, as well as gentle activities that involve the whole body, such as swimming, cycling and walking.to begin with, you may receive specialised massages called manual lymphatic drainage (mld) – usually carried out by a specialist therapist – to move fluid from the swollen areas into working lymph nodes, where it can be drained.your lymphoedema therapist will also teach you a range of simpler massage techniques that you or your carer can use during the maintenance phase of treatment, to help keep the swelling down. these self-massage techniques are known as simple lymphatic drainage (sld).in a small number of cases, surgery may be considered to treat lymphoedema. there are three main types of surgery that may be useful for the condition: the removal of sections of excess skin and underlying tissue (debulking) the removal of fat from the affected limb (liposuction) – see below the restoration of the flow of fluid around the affected section of the lymphatic system – for example, by connecting the lymphatic system to nearby blood vessels (lymphaticovenular anastomosis)these treatments may help to reduce the size of areas of the body affected by lymphoedema, but some are still experimental – particularly lymphaticovenular anastomosis – and are not in widespread use.liposuction is where a thin tube is inserted through small incisions in the skin to suck fat out of tissue. it can be used to remove excess fat from an affected limb to help reduce its size.once the surgery is complete, you will have to wear a compression garment on the affected limb day and night for at least a year to help keep the swelling down.thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)states that liposuction for chronic (long-term) lymphoedema appears to be safe, and may be effective in the short term. however, nice says there is not enough evidence of its long-term effectiveness and safety.access to liposuction for lymphoedema may be limited, depending on what is available from your local nhs clinical commissioning group (ccg).cellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema, but psychological issues can also occur as a result of the condition.these complications are explained below.many people with lymphoedema experience repeated episodes ofcellulitis(also known as erysipelas). cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) and the layer of fat and soft tissues (the subcutaneous tissues) that lie underneath the skin. cellulitis can occur as a result of lymphoedema and can also cause the condition.symptoms of cellulitis can include: redness and a feeling of heat in the skin pain in the affected area a high temperature (fever) chillscellulitis can usually be successfully treated withantibiotics, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital.in some cases, you may be provided with a short supply of antibiotic tablets to use as soon as you notice symptoms of cellulitis. alternatively, you may be given a long-term course of antibiotics to take to prevent infection.living with a chronic (long-term) condition that affects your appearance, such as lymphoedema, can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods ofdepression.if you have been feeling particularly down for the last few months and you no longer take pleasure in the things you usually enjoy, you may be depressed. if this is the case, talk to your gp or members of your lymphoedema treatment team, because there are effective treatments for depression.talking to other people who also have lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety. thelymphoedema support networkoffers information and advice, and can put you in touch with a support group in your area.remember: if you persevere with your treatment plan, your symptoms should eventually become less noticeable.read more abouttreating lymphoedemait’s not possible to completely prevent lymphoedema, but the following steps may help reduce your chances of developing the condition.if you already have lymphoedema, this advice may stop it getting worse.the part of your body affected by lymphoedema is more vulnerable to infection of the build-up of fluid within the tissues. any cuts in your skin can allow bacteria to enter your body and may quickly develop into an infection.skin infections can also damage your lymphatic system and cause lymphoedema to develop.you can reduce your chances of developing skin infections by: not having injections or blood pressure readings in the affected area whenever possible treating cuts and scratches immediately with an antiseptic cream using insect repellents to preventinsect bites moisturising the skin daily to keep it supple – your gp can prescribe a suitable cream avoiding very hot baths and showers – the heat from saunas, steam rooms and sun beds may also increase the swelling using sun cream with a high sun protection factor (spf) to preventsunburn wearing gloves for gardening and household tasks to avoid cuts, if your upper limbs are affected using anti-fungal powder to prevent fungal infections in your skin or feet, if your lower limbs are affected cutting your nails with nail clippers seeing a chiropodist for foot and nail care – but make sure you tell them you have lymphoedema wearing shoes that fit correctly and provide support on the top of your feet, if your lower limbs are affected using an electric razor if you need to shave to reduce the risk of cutting yourself not wearing tight-fitting clothes or jewellerycontact your gp as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of a possible skin infection, such as redness and a feeling of heat in the skin.adopting a healthy lifestyle may also help reduce your risk of developing lymphoedema, and may help control the condition if you already have it.this includes: eating a healthy diet maintaining a healthy weight exercising regularly breast cancer (female) radiotherapy lymphoedema support network cancer research

       " 'Malaria': 'malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes. if it isn’t diagnosed and treated quickly, it can be fatal.a single mosquito bite is all it takes for someone to become infected.it’s important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you’re travelling to areas where there’s a high risk of the disease. this means that you can get medical attention quickly.symptoms are similar to those of flu and usually appear 6 to 30 days after the mosquito bite, but it can sometimes take up to a year for symptoms to start.the initial symptoms of malaria include: a high temperature (fever) headache sweats chills muscle aches or pains vomiting and or diarrhoeathese symptoms can start mild and may be difficult to identify as malaria.malaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. it can be fatal if not treated quickly.the effects of malaria are usually more severe in: babies young children pregnant women older people you or your child develop symptoms of malaria during or after a visit to an area where the disease is found, even if it has been several weeks, months or a year after you return from travellingyou must tell the healthcare professional that you have been in a country with a risk of malaria, including any brief stopovers.malaria is caused by the plasmodium parasite. the parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.there are 5 different types of plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. they are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be.all malaria infections cause the same symptoms and require immediate medical attention. it’s not possible to find out which type of malaria you have from symptoms alone. plasmodium falciparum – mainly found in africa, it’s the most common type of malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria deaths worldwide, though treatment does cure the infection. plasmodium vivax – mainly found in asia and south america, this parasite causes milder symptoms but it can stay in the liver for years which can result in symptoms reoccurring if it isn’t treated properly. plasmodium ovale – fairly uncommon and usually found in west africa. plasmodium malariae – this is quite rare and usually only found in africa. plasmodium knowlesi – this is very rare and found in parts of southeast asia.the plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. these are known as ‘night-biting’ mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise.when a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it becomes infected and spreads the parasite to the next person it bites. malaria can’t be spread directly from person to person.when an infected mosquito bites, the parasite enters the blood and travels to the liver. in the liver, it develops for days to weeks before re-entering the blood. this is the point where symptoms develop and urgent treatment is required.although it is very rare, malaria can also be spread from a person with the infection throughblood transfusionsand sharing needles.malaria is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. it is not found in the uk or europe.thefitfortravelwebsite has more information about therisk of malaria in individual countries.malaria is a serious illness that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated quickly. severe complications of malaria can occur within hours or days of the first symptoms. this means it is important to seek urgent medical help as soon as possible.the destruction of red blood cells by the malaria parasite can cause severeanaemia.anaemia is a condition where the red blood cells are unable to carry enough oxygen to the body’s muscles and organs. this can leave you feeling drowsy, weak and faint.in rare cases, malaria can affect the brain. this is known as cerebral malaria which can cause your brain to swell, sometimes leading to permanent brain damage. it can also cause fits (seizures) or coma.other complications that can arise as a result of severe malaria include: liver failure and jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes shock – a sudden drop in blood pressure pulmonary oedema – a build-up of fluid in the lungs acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) abnormally low blood sugar –hypoglycaemia kidney failure swelling and rupturing of the spleen dehydrationif you get malaria while pregnant, you and your baby have an increased risk of developing serious complications like: premature birth– birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy low birth weight restricted growth of the baby in the womb stillbirth miscarriage death of the motherpregnant women are advised to avoid travelling to regions with a risk of malaria.visit your gp, midwife, obstetrician or travel health advisor for a full discussion if you’re pregnant and are thinking of travelling to a high-risk area. not all antimalarial tablets are safe in pregnancy and it’s important you get specific advice.if you travel to an area that has malaria, you are at risk of the infection. it’s very important that you take precautions to prevent the disease and get treatment immediately if symptoms do develop.malaria can often be avoided using the abcd approach to prevention, which stands for: awareness of risk – find out whether you’re at risk of getting malaria bite prevention – use insect repellent, cover your skin with clothing, and use a mosquito net to avoid mosquito bites check whether you need to take antimalarial prevention tablets by visiting a travel health clinic – if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose and finish the course diagnosis – seek immediate medical advice if you have malaria symptoms, including up to a year after you return from travellingcheck whether you’re travelling to a malaria risk area on the fitfortravel websitevisit your local travel clinic for malaria advice as soon as you know that you are travelling to a risk area.if you grew up in a country where malaria is common, any natural protection will be quickly lost when you move. this means you need to protect yourself from infection if you’re now travelling to a risk area, even if that’s where you grew up.further information abouttravel health and vaccinations.avoiding mosquito bites is one of the best ways to prevent malaria. this is particularly important during early evening and at night when mosquitoes bite.there are several steps you can take to avoid being bitten. mosquitoes can’t bite through clothing so wear light, loose-fitting clothing that will cover your arms and legs apply insect repellent to all areas of your skin that are not covered by clothing, including your face and neck remember to reapply insect repellent frequently sleep under a mosquito net that’s been treated with an insecticide, or in a room with effective air conditioningthe most effective repellents contain 50% diethyltoluamide (deet). these are available in: sprays roll-ons sticks creamsthere’s no evidence to suggest that other remedies protect against malaria, such as homeopathic remedies, electronic buzzers,vitamins b1 or b12, garlic, yeast extract spread (marmite), tea tree oils or bath oils.further information on mosquito bite prevention is available from thefitfortravelwebsite.antimalarial tablets can help prevent you from developing a malaria infection. for the best protection, you must also follow mosquito bite prevention advice.you must start taking antimalarial tablets before travel and continue taking them whilst travelling in the risk area. antimalarial tablets must also be taken for a period of time after you have left the risk area.how long antimalarial tablets should be taken will depend on which tablet is used.antimalarial tablets don’t stop malaria from entering your body. however, they do stop the infection from developing inside your body and prevent you from getting ill.if you stop taking your antimalarial tablets early (even when you are back in the uk) you could still become ill with malaria.you may need to take a short trial course of antimalarial tablets before travelling. this is to check that side effects do not occur and that you do not have an adverse reaction. if you do, alternative antimalarials can be prescribed before you leave. make sure you get the right antimalarial tablets before you go – visit a travel health clinic for advice on which is the best antimalarial for you follow the instructions included with your tablets carefully make sure you complete the full course of tabletsthere’s currently no vaccine available that offers protection against malaria.the type of antimalarial tablets that you will be recommended is based on the following information: where you’re going any relevant family medical history your medical history, including any allergies to medication any medication you’re currently taking any problems you’ve had with antimalarial medicines in the past your age whether you’re pregnantif you’ve taken antimalarial medication in the past, don’t assume it’s suitable for future trips.the type of antimalarial that you will need to take depends on which strain of malaria is carried by the mosquitoes in an area. it will also depend on whether they’re resistant to certain types of antimalarial medication.the main types of antimalarials used to prevent malaria are: atovaquone plus proguanil (also known as maloff protect or malarone) doxycycline (also known as vibramycin-d) mefloquine (also known as lariam)to find out what type of antimalarial medication is best for you, visit your local travel clinic.if malaria is diagnosed and treated quickly, you should fully recover. treatment should be started as soon as possible.treatment begins in a hospital to make sure complications don’t suddenly develop. treatment is with tablets or capsules. if someone is very ill, treatment will be given through a drip into a vein in the arm (intravenously).treatment for malaria can leave you feeling very tired and weak for several weeks.the type of medicine and how long you need to take it will depend on: the type of malaria you have the severity of your symptoms whether you took preventative antimalarial tablets your age whether you’re pregnant',\n",
       " 'Malignant brain tumour (cancerous)': 'a malignant brain tumour is a fast-growing cancer that spreads to other areas of the brain and spine.generally, brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4, according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. a malignant brain tumour is either grade 3 or 4, whereas grade 1 or 2 tumours are usually classed as benign or non-cancerous.most malignant tumours are secondary cancers, which means they started in another part of the body and spread to the brain. primary brain tumours are those that started in the brain.these pages focus on high-grade brain tumours. for information about grade 1 or 2 tumours, read our pages onlow-grade (benign) brain tumours.the symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain.common symptoms include: severe, persistentheadaches seizures (fits) persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problemsspeak to your gp if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. while it’s unlikely to be a tumour, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.read more about thesymptoms of malignant brain tumoursanddiagnosing malignant brain tumours.most malignant brain tumours develop from the glial tissue, which supports the brain’s nerve cells. these tumours are known as gliomas.gliomas can be separated further, depending on the cells they developed from. for example: an astrocytoma develops from cells thought to provide the brain’s framework an oligodendroglioma develops from the cells that produce the fatty covering of nerves an ependymoma develops from the cells that line the cavities in the brainit’s also possible to have a malignant tumour that’s a mixture of these types or developed in a different part of the brain.brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.the exact cause of primary malignant brain tumours is unknown, although it’s thought that certain genetic conditions and previousradiotherapytreatment to the head may increase the risk of one developing.read more about thecauses of malignant brain tumours.a primary malignant brain tumour needs to be treated as soon as possible, because it can spread and damage other parts of the brain and spinal cord.surgery will usually need to be carried out to remove as much of the tumour as possible. this may be followed by radiotherapy and/orchemotherapyto kill any cancerous cells left behind and reduce the chances of the tumour regrowing.however, malignant tumours will often eventually return after treatment. if this happens, or if you have a secondary tumour, a cure isn’t usually possible and treatment can instead be used to improve symptoms and prolong life.read more abouttreating malignant brain tumours.living with a brain tumour is not easy. you may feel worried and anxious about what’s going to happen to you and your family. this is perfectly normal.it can help to seek accurate medical information about your specific tumour and its treatment, make sure you’re closely involved in decisions about your care, and ask your care team about anything you’re not sure about.you can read more about living with a brain tumour onthe brain tumour charity’s website.your doctor may be able to refer you to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of diagnosis and treatment. there are also many organisations and helplines that can help, such asthe brain tumour charityandbrain tumour research.being a carer is not an easy role. when you are busy responding to the needs of others, it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy, and make it easy for you to forget your own health and mental wellbeing.research on carers’ health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. if you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress.however, neglecting your own health doesn’t work in the long term. if you’re caring for someone else, it’s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. it’s in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.for more information on the support available to you and benefits you may be entitled to, visitcare information scotland.the symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain.when symptoms do occur, it is because the brain tumour is either putting pressure on the brain or preventing an area of the brain from functioning properly.common symptoms of increased pressure within the skull include: severe, persistentheadaches– which are typically worse in the morning or when bending over or coughing persistent nausea and vomiting drowsiness vision problems – such as blurred vision, floaters and loss of vision that may come and go seizures (fits) – which may affect the whole body or just involve a twitch in one areadifferent areas of the brain control different functions, so the symptoms caused by a brain tumour will depend on where the tumour is located. for example, a tumour affecting: the frontal lobe may cause changes in personality, weakness in one side of the body and loss of smell the temporal lobe may cause forgetfulness, language problems (aphasia) and seizures the parietal lobe may cause aphasia and numbness or weakness in one side of the body the occipital lobe may cause loss of vision on one side the cerebellum may cause a loss of co-ordination, flickering of the eyes, vomiting and a stiff neck the brain stem may cause unsteadiness and difficulty walking, facial weakness, double vision, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria) and swallowing (dysphagia)it’s important to speak to a doctor if you develop persistent and worrying symptoms that may be caused by a brain tumour. while it’s unlikely that you have a tumour, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.if your gp is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.read more aboutdiagnosing malignant brain tumours.most malignant brain tumours are caused by a cancer that started somewhere else in the body and spread to the brain, through the bloodstream. these are known as secondary tumours.cancers that can spread to the brain includelung cancer,breast cancer,bowel cancerandmelanoma skin cancer.some primary malignant brain cancers (cancerous tumours that start in the brain) are caused by a previouslybenign brain tumourbecoming cancerous, but usually the exact reason why a primary tumour develops is unknown.brain tumours affect people of all ages, including children, but the risk tends to increase as you get older. most tumours affect people over 50 years of age.people with a family history of brain tumours may be at a slightly increased risk of developing a brain tumour themselves.if your brain is exposed to radiation duringradiotherapy, your risk of developing certain types of brain tumour later on is increased.some genetic conditions can increase your risk of a brain tumour, such as: neurofibromatosis type 1 or neurofibromatosis type 2 tuberous sclerosis turcot syndrome li-fraumeni cancer syndrome von hippel-lindau syndrome gorlin syndromeunlike most brain tumours, tumours associated with these conditions tend to develop in childhood or early adulthood.there have been reports in the media about a possible connection between brain tumours and the radiofrequency (rf) energy emitted by mobile phones. rf energy produces heat, which can increase body temperature and damage tissue exposed to it.however, it’s thought that the amount of rf energy people are exposed to from mobile phones is too low to produce significant tissue heating or an increase in body temperature.research is underway to establish whether rf energy has any long-term health effects, but the balance of evidence currently available suggests that it’s unlikely mobile phones cause health problems.speak to your gp if you develop any of thesymptoms of a malignant brain tumour, such as a persistent and severe headache.your gp will examine you and ask about your symptoms. they may also carry out a simple neurological examination.if they suspect you may have a tumour, or they are not sure what’s causing your symptoms, you’ll probably be referred to a neurologist (brain and nerve specialist).your gp or neurologist may carry out a test of your nervous system, called a neurological examination, to look for problems associated with a brain tumour.this may involve tests of your: hand and limb strength reflexes, such as your knee-jerk reflex hearing and vision skin sensitivity balance and co-ordination memory and mental agility (using simple questions or arithmetic)a neurologist may also recommend one or more further tests.other tests you may have to help diagnose a brain tumour include: acomputerised tomography (ct) scan– this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a series of x-rays amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a strong magnetic field and radio waves an electroencephalogram (eeg) – where electrodes attached to your scalp record your brain activity to look for any abnormalitiesif a tumour is suspected, abiopsy(surgical removal of a small piece of tissue) may be taken to establish the type of tumour and the most effective treatment.under anaesthetic, a small hole (known as a burr hole) is made in the skull and a very fine needle is used to obtain a sample of tumour tissue. you’ll probably need to stay in hospital for a few days afterwards.if you have a malignant brain tumour, you’ll usually need surgery to remove as much of it as possible. radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may then be used to treat any remaining cancerous tissue.the aim of this is to remove or destroy as much of the tumour as possible, ideally getting rid of the cancerous cells completely. however, this isn’t always possible and most malignant brain tumours will eventually return after treatment.if your tumour does return after treatment, or you have a secondary brain tumour (where cancer has spread to your brain from another part of your body), a cure isn’t usually possible. treatment can instead be used to control your symptoms and prolong life.there are a number of different treatments for malignant brain tumours, and deciding on what you feel is the best treatment can be confusing.a group of different specialists called a multidisciplinary team (mdt) will be involved in your care and will recommend what they think is the best treatment option for you, but the final decision will be yours.before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions that you’d like to ask. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.surgery will be recommended for most people with a malignant brain tumour. if the size or position of the tumour mean surgery is not possible, one or more of the treatments described below may be recommended instead.the main operation used to treat people with brain tumours is called a craniotomy. you will be given ageneral anaestheticso you are asleep while the procedure is carried out. an area of your scalp will be shaved and a section of the skull is cut out as a flap to reveal the brain and tumour underneath.the surgeon can then remove as much of the tumour as possible and secure the flap of skull back in place with metal screws.after surgery, treatment with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may be recommended to kill any cancer cells left behind and reduce the risk of the tumour coming back.radiotherapyis a treatment where a beam of high-energy radiation is focused on the tumour to kill the cancerous cells. it can be used after surgery or as the main treatment for tumours that are difficult to remove.radiotherapy is usually given in several doses (fractions) spread over the course of a week. an entire course of treatment will usually last up to 6 weeks in total.possible side effects of radiotherapy for a brain tumour include nausea, temporary hair loss, tiredness and red, sore skin. read more about theside effects of radiotherapy.in a small number of cases, a similar treatment called proton beam therapy may be recommended. however, this is only suitable in very specific cases and currently, you’ll need to be referred for treatment abroad if your doctor thinks it’s appropriate.chemotherapyis a medication used to kill cancerous cells. it may be used alongside radiotherapy or on its own, either to help kill any cancerous cells left behind after surgery or to help relieve your symptoms when a cure is not possible.chemotherapy medication for brain tumours can be given in a number of ways, including as: tablets (orally) – temozolomide and procarbazine are given in this way injections into a vein (intravenously) – vincristine is given in this way small, disc-like implants placed in the brain during surgery – carmustine can be given in this way, but is only recommended if 90% or more of the tumour has been removedthe side effects of chemotherapy largely depend on the specific medication you’re taking. common general side effects include tiredness, headaches, temporary hair loss and nausea. read more about theside effects of chemotherapy.for more information about some of the treatments used, see the guidelines from the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) oncarmustine implants to treat gliomasandtemozolomide for recurrent malignant glioma.stereotactic radiosurgery (srs)is a special type of radiotherapy that’s sometimes used to treat brain tumours that can’t be safely removed with surgery.during the treatment, several small beams of radiation are used to very accurately deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumour, usually in a single treatment session.as the radiation beams can be aimed very precisely, a high dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumour with minimal damage to the surrounding healthy cells.this means you’re less likely to experience many of the usual side effects of radiotherapy. recovery tends to be much faster and an overnight stay isn’t usually necessary.however, radiosurgery is currently only available in a few specialised centres across the uk and is only suitable for certain people, based on the characteristics of their tumour.you may also be given medication to relieve some of the symptoms you may have as a result of your brain tumour.these may include: anticonvulsants to prevent seizures (fits) corticosteroidsto reduce swelling and pressure in the brain painkillers to treatheadaches anti-emetics to prevent vomitingdepending on your circumstances, these medications may be given before, after, or instead of surgery.if your tumour is at an advanced stage or in a difficult place in the brain, a cure may not be possible and treatment may only be able to control the cancer for a period of time. this means you will be getting the side effects of treatment without getting rid of the tumour.in this situation, it may be difficult to decide whether or not to go ahead with treatment. talk to your doctor about what will happen if you choose not to be treated, so you can make an informed decision.if you decide not to have treatment, you will still be givenpalliative care, which will control your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.after being treated for a brain tumour, you may need additional care to monitor and treat any further problems.malignant brain tumours often grow back after treatment, so regular follow-up appointments will be recommended to look for signs that this may have happened.these appointments may include a discussion of any worrying new symptoms you experience, a physical examination, and occasionally a brain scan.you will usually have follow-up appointments at least every few months to begin with, but they may be needed less frequently over time if no problems develop.problems caused by a brain tumour don’t always resolve as soon as the tumour is removed or treated. for example, some people have persistent weakness, seizures (fits), difficulty walking and speech problems.in these cases, you may need extra support to help you overcome or adapt to any problems you have. this may include therapies such as: physiotherapy – to help with any movement problems you have occupational therapy – to identify any problems you’re having with daily activities and arrange for any equipment or alterations to your home that may help speech therapy – to help you with any communication or swallowing problemssome people may also need to continue taking medication for seizures for a few months or more after their tumour has been treated or removed.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has made recommendations on the standards of care that brain tumour patients should receive. for more information, see theservice guidance for improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours.you may not be allowed to drive for a while after you’ve had a brain tumour. this will depend on things such as the type of brain tumour you had, where it was in the brain, and what symptoms you have.if you are required to give up your driving licence and notify thedvla, they will speak to your gp or specialist to determine when you can drive again.with up-to-date scans and advice from your medical team, you may be allowed to drive again once an agreed period has passed and you have successfully completed a medical test to determine your ability to control a vehicle.you can find out aboutbrain tumours and drivingon the cancer research uk website.flying is usually possible from 3 months after treatment.after you have been treated for a brain tumour, you must permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing. you can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.swimming unsupervised is not recommended for around 1 year after treatment, as there is a risk you could have an epileptic fit while in the water.it’s safe to have sex after treatment for a brain tumour.women may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment. if you’re planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.you’ll usually tire more easily following treatment for a brain tumour.you may wish to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, but it’s probably a good idea to return part-time to begin with and only go back full-time when you feel able to.if you’ve experienced seizures, you shouldn’t work with machinery or at heights.a brain tumour is often life-changing. you may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained. if it will help, your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker and counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis.there are also many organisations that can provide information and support, such asthe brain tumour charityandbrain tumour research.if you have been diagnosed with a brain tumour, your treatment and medical care will probably be the first thing on your mind. but there are other aspects of your life to think about and it is important to know exactly what kind of assistance is available and where you can get it.if you are finding it hard to cope with day-to-day life, talk about your needs with your doctor or nurse, who will refer you to a social worker. your social worker will assess exactly the kind of help you need.help you may need might include: a care attendant, who can help with housework, dressing and washing, or even just keep you company and give your carer a break a ‘meals on wheels’ service income support, disability living allowance or attendance allowance equipment and adaptations for your homefor more information about what help you might need and how

       " 'Malnutrition': \"malnutrition means poor nutrition. most commonly this is caused by not eating enough (undernutrition) or not eating enough of the right food to give your body the nutrients it needs.a balanced diet should provide enough nutrients like calories, protein and vitamins, to keep you healthy. without this, you may not be getting all the nutrients you need and this can lead to malnutrition.malnutrition can result in:this can leave you feeling tired, weak and affect your ability to recover from an illness.malnutrition can be difficult to recognise. it can happen very gradually, which can make it very difficult to spot in the early stages.common signs and symptoms of malnutrition include: loss of appetite and lack of interest in food or fluids unplanned weight loss – this might cause clothing, rings, watches or dentures to become loose tiredness or low energy levels reduced ability to perform everyday tasks like showering, getting dressed or cooking reduced muscle strength – for example, not being able to walk as far or as fast as usual changes in mood which might cause feelings of lethargy and depression poor concentration poor growth in children increased risk of infection, recurrent infections, taking longer to recover and poor wound healing difficulty keeping warm dizziness you have any of the symptoms of malnutrition you notice a drop in weight or you’ve lost weight without tryingsometimes, medical conditions cause your body to need more nutrients. some medical conditions can lead to your body being unable to absorb or use nutrients. these may include: cancerandliver diseasethat can cause a lack of appetite, persistent pain or nausea copd, pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, which cause your body to need more nutrients but can reduce your appetite mental health conditions, likedepressionorschizophrenia, which may affect your ability to look after yourself crohn’s disease,ulcerative colitisorcystic fibrosisthat disrupt your body’s ability to digest food or absorb nutrients burns, fractures and post major surgery, due to increased demand for nutrients dementia– people with dementia may be unable to communicate their needs, may use up a lot of calories pacing or may experience a loss of appetite dysphagia– a condition that makes swallowing difficult or painful persistent vomiting ordiarrhoeasome types and combinations of medication can increase your risk of developing malnutrition. always check your medicines information and speak to a healthcare professional for advice if you have a concern. do not stop taking your medication without advice from a healthcare professional.physical, social and ageing issues can also cause malnutrition.physical issues can contribute to malnutrition. for example: if your teeth are in a poor condition, if your dentures do not fit, or if you have a sore mouth, eating can be difficult or painful you may lose your appetite as a result of losing your sense of smell and taste you may have a physical disability or other physical impairment that makes it difficult for you to cook or shop for food yourselfsocial issues that can contribute to malnutrition include: living alone and being socially isolated having limited knowledge about nutrition or cooking reduced mobility alcohol or drug use low income or poverty reliance on food banksas we get older we might become more likely to experience malnutrition. this might be because of how we feel, and physical and social factors. the risk also increases because we’re more likely to have one or more medical conditions as we get older.a healthcare professional can assess you for malnutrition using a screening tool like‘malnutrition universal screening tool’ (‘must’).screen yourself for malnutritionif you’ve lost weight or your appetite is poor, you can make simple changes to your meals, snacks and drinks to help treat malnutrition.choosing nutrient-dense food and drinks can help improve your calorie intake. this might not be suitable for everyone, especially those with other conditions like dysphagia. ask your gp, dietitian or nurse for further advice if you’re unsure.you should speak to a healthcare professional if you’ve had to limit the fat and sugar you eat in the past due to a health condition like high cholesterol or diabetes.try the following ideas to help you to increase the amount of calories and protein in your diet. eat ‘little and often’ – 3 small meals a day with 2-3 snacks in-between meals include protein like meat, fish, chicken, eggs, beans or lentils in each meal add high calorie ingredients like full cream milk, cheese, butter, ghee, olive oil and cream to meals and drinks include puddings after your lunch and dinner like creamy yoghurts, custards, rice pudding, milk puddings or ice-cream try ready meals if you don’t feel like cooking choose nourishing milky drinks like malted drinks, hot chocolate, milky coffee and milkshakes choose high sugar drinks like fruit juice, smoothies, fizzy drinks or squash (you can also add egg powder to juice to increase its nutrients) try including 1 pint of full cream milk each day – you can fortify (add extra nutrients to) this by adding 4 tablespoons of dried milk powder – and use this in drinks, cooking, cereals and puddings do not have drinks just before meals because this can make you feel fuller quicker do not choose low fat, sugar-free, diet foods and drinks – for example skimmed milkif you’re using vegan alternatives to cheese, butter, cream or milk, try to choose the highest calorie option.watch this video to find out how to fortify your milk with milk powder. you can then use this instead of your usual milk.watch this video to find out how to fortify your juice using egg powder.there are ways you can use every day food and drinks to fortify (add extra nutrients to) your food.add extra butter to: sandwiches or toast mashed potatoes vegetables sauces baked potatoes

nutrition.they contain calories, protein, vitamins and minerals to help increase your intake. they’re designed to be taken alongside your diet and the ‘food first’ advice above to promote progress with your weight.depending on how severe your symptoms are, your healthcare professional might recommend a “feeding tube”.there are different types of tubes. which one is best for you depends on your diagnosis and symptoms.the most common types of feeding tube include: nasogastric – through your nose and into your stomach nasojejunal – though your nose and further into your digestive tract

       " 'Mesothelioma': 'mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body’s organs. it’s usually linked to asbestos exposure.mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles.most cases are diagnosed in people aged 60 to 80 and men are affected more commonly than women.unfortunately, it’s rarely possible to cure mesothelioma, although treatment can help control the symptoms.the symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. they typically don’t appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos.symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs include:symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the tummy include: tummy painor swelling feeling or being sick loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss diarrhoeaorconstipationspeak to your gp if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. tell them about any exposure to asbestos you may have had in the past.mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction.these tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. it usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos.the use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. however, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.read more aboutasbestos and people at risk of exposureandavoiding exposure to asbestos.if your gp suspects mesothelioma, they will refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests.a number of different tests may need to be carried out, including: anx-rayof your chest or tummy a computerised tomography (ct) scan– a number of x-ray images are taken to create a detailed image of the inside of the body fluid drainage – if there’s a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy – the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that’s inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation oranaesthetic; a sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed so it can be analysedthese tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it has spread.the best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.as mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible. this is known aspalliative or supportive care.possible treatments include: chemotherapy– this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer radiotherapy– this involves using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control surgery – an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it’s not clear whether surgery is helpfulyou’ll also probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. for example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help relieve your pain.sometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back again by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. your doctors should discuss these treatments with you. asbestosis mesothelioma uk asthma and lung uk: mesothelioma cancer research uk: mesothelioma macmillan cancer support: mesothelioma',\n",
       " 'Middle ear infection (otitis media)': 'otitis media is an infection of the middle ear. it causes inflammation (redness and swelling) and a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum.anyone can develop a middle ear infection, but they’re most common in young children.you do not always need to see a gp as most ear infections get better on their own within 3 to 5 days.the main symptoms of a middle ear infection include:in some cases, a hole may develop in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) and pus may run out of the ear. the earache, which is caused by the build-up of fluid stretching the eardrum, then resolves.young children and babies with an ear infection may also: rub or pull their ear not react to some sounds be irritable or restless be off their food keep losing their balanceyou or your child has: symptoms that do not improve within 2 or 3 days regular ear infections a lot of pain a discharge of pus or fluid from the ear an underlying health condition, such ascystic fibrosisorcongenital heart disease, which could make complications more likelyif your gp practice is closed, phone 111.most ear infections get better on their own within 3 to 5 days and do not need any specific treatment.if needed,paracetamoloribuprofencan be used to relieve pain and a high temperature. always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. follow the recommended dosage instructions. if you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child,speak to a pharmacistfor advice.placing a warm cloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain.antibioticsare not usually used to treat middle ear infections.most middle ear infections occur when an infection, such as acold, leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear. this causes the eustachian tube (a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or blocked. the mucus can’t drain away properly, making it easier for an infection to spread into the middle ear.an enlarged adenoid (soft tissue at the back of the throat) can also block the eustachian tube. the adenoid can be removed if it often causes ear infections.middle ear infections are more common in younger children because: the eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults a child’s adenoids are relatively larger than an adultscertain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including: having a cleft palate havingdown’s syndromeit’s not possible to prevent middle ear infections. there are some things you can do that may reduce your child’s risk of developing one. make sure your child is up-to-date with their routine vaccinations – particularly thepneumococcal vaccineand thedtap/ipv/hib/hepb (6-in-1) vaccine if possible, feed your baby with breast milk rather than formula milk do not expose your child to smoky environments (passive smoking) do not give your child a dummy once they’re older than 12 months old do not feed your child while they’re lying flat on their backchildren who go to nursery or school can pick up infections from other children who are unwell.complications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious.most complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head. rarely, infections can leave a perforation or hole in the eardrum.if complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital. earache self-help guide: earache action on hearing loss family lives',\n",
       " 'Migraine': 'migraine is a common health condition. it affects around 1 in every 5 women and around 1 in every 15 men. they usually begin in early adulthood.a migraine is usually a moderate or severe headache felt as a throbbing pain on one side of the head. many people also have symptoms like nausea, vomiting and increased sensitivity to light or sound.there are several types of migraine, including:some people have frequent migraines up to several times a week. other people only have occasional migraines. it’s possible for years to pass between migraine attacks.the main symptom of a migraine is usually an intense headache on one side of the head. in some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck.the pain is usually a moderate or severe throbbing sensation. the pain gets worse when you move and may prevent you from carrying out normal activities.other symptoms associated with a migraine include: nausea vomiting increased sensitivity to light and sound – which is why many people with a migraine want to rest in a quiet, dark roomsome people experience other symptoms, including: sweating poor concentration feeling very hot or very cold abdominal (tummy) pain diarrhoea dizziness (light headedness)not everyone with a migraine experiences these additional symptoms. some people may experience them without having aheadache.the symptoms of a migraine usually last between 4 hours and 3 days. you may feel very tired for up to a week afterwards.about 1 in 3 people with migraines have temporary warning symptoms, known as aura, before a migraine. these include: visual problems – such as seeing flashing lights, zig-zag patterns or blind spots numbness or a tingling sensation like pins and needles – which usually starts in one hand and moves up your arm before affecting your face, lips and tongue difficulty speakingsometimes, you might also experience: feeling dizzy or off balance loss of consciousness – although this is unusualaura symptoms typically develop over the course of about 5 minutes and last for up to an hour. the aura might start before the headache or you might experience it at the same time as a headache. some people may experience aura followed by only a mild headache or no headache at all. you have frequent or severe migraine symptoms paralysis or weakness in one or both arms and/or one side of the face slurred or garbled speech a sudden agonising headache resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before headache along with a high temperature (fever), stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision and a rashthese symptoms may be a sign of a more serious condition, like astrokeormeningitis. you should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible.the exact cause of migraines is unknown. they’re thought to be the result of abnormal brain activity temporarily affecting nerve signals, chemicals and blood vessels in the brain.around half of all people who experience migraines have a close relative with the condition. this suggests that genes may play a role.it may help to keep a diary to see if you can identify a consistent trigger. it can be difficult to tell if something is a trigger or if what you’re experiencing is an early symptom of a migraine attack.there might not always be a trigger for your headache.possible migraine triggers include:some women experience migraines around the time of their period. this might be because of changes in the levels of hormones like oestrogen around this time.these types of migraines usually occur between 2 days before the start of your period to 3 days after. some women only experience migraines around this time. this is known as pure menstrual migraine. most women experience them at other times too. this is called menstrual related migraine.some women find their migraines become worse during perimenopause. however, they might improve or disappear a few years after your last period. stress anxiety tension shock depression excitement tiredness poor quality sleep shift work poor posture neck or shoulder tension jet lag fasting or low blood sugar

to relieve symptoms of the menopausethere are other types of medications that can cause some people to experience migraines.speak to your gp if you start to experience migraines after starting to take new medication.there’s no specific test to diagnose migraines. for an accurate diagnosis, your gp must identify a pattern of recurring headaches along with the associated symptoms.migraines can be unpredictable, sometimes occurring without the other symptoms. obtaining an accurate diagnosis can sometimes take time.your gp might do a physical examination and check your vision, co-ordination, reflexes and sensations. these will help rule out some other possible underlying causes of your symptoms.your gp may ask if your headaches are: on one side of the head a pulsating pain severe enough to prevent you carrying out daily activities made worse by physical activity or moving about accompanied by nausea and vomiting accompanied by sensitivity to light and noiseto help with the diagnosis, it can be useful to keep a diary of your migraine attacks for a few weeks. note down details like: the date time what you were doing when the migraine began how long the attack lasted what symptoms you experienced what medication you took (if any)taking too many painkillers is a reason why migraines can become difficult to treat. this is called medication overuse headache. keep a record of what painkillers you take and how often you take them. you shouldn’t take painkillers on more than 10 days every month in the long-term.it can be helpful to make a note when your start your period, if you have one. this can help your gp identify potential triggers.read more aboutkeeping a migraine diaryon the migraine trust website.your gp may decide to refer you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system). they’ll do further assessments and offer treatment if: a diagnosis is unclear you experience significant migraines not controlled by your current treatmentthere’s no cure for migraines. there are treatments available to help reduce the symptoms. during an attack, many people find that sleeping or lying in a darkened room can also help.it may take time to work out the best treatment for you. you may need to try different types or combinations of medicines before you find the most effective ones. if you can’t manage your migraines using over-the-counter medicines, your gp may prescribe something stronger.always make sure you read the medication instructions and follow the dosage recommendations.children under 16 shouldn’t take aspirin unless it’s under the guidance of a healthcare professional.aspirin and ibuprofen are not recommended for adults who have a history of stomach problems, likestomach ulcers, liver problems or kidney problems.many people find that over-the-counter painkillers, likeparacetamol, aspirin oribuprofen, can help to reduce their symptoms.they tend to be most effective if taken at the first signs of a migraine attack. this gives them time to absorb into your bloodstream and ease your symptoms.you shouldn’t wait until the headache worsens before taking painkillers as it’s often too late for the medication to work. soluble painkillers (tablets you dissolve in a glass of water) are a good option because they’re absorbed quickly by your body.taking too many painkillers can lead to medication overuse headache. you should not take them more than 15 days per month.if you can’t swallow painkillers because of nausea or vomiting, you should speak to your gp about anti sickness medication or suppository options. suppositories are capsules that you insert into the anus (back passage).opiates like codeine should not be prescribed as a treatment for migraines. they’re not any more effective than triptans and painkillers and can cause nausea and medication overuse headache.if over the counter medication is not helping your symptoms, your gp might recommend a triptan and/or anti sickness medication.triptan medicines are a specific painkiller for migraine headaches. they’re thought to work by reversing the changes in the brain that may cause migraine headaches.triptans are available as tablets, injections and nasal sprays.common side effects of triptans include: warm-sensations tightness tingling flushing and light headedness feelings of heaviness in the face, throat, limbs or chestsome people also experience nausea, dry mouth and drowsiness. these side effects are usually mild and improve on their own.taking too many triptans can lead to medication overuse headache. you should not take them more than 10 days per month.your gp will usually recommend having a follow-up appointment once you’ve finished your first course of treatment. this is so you can discuss their effectiveness and whether you had any side effects.if treatment is not effective or causes unpleasant side effects, your gp may try prescribing a different type of triptan. everyone reacts differently to each type of triptan.triptans can be taken at the same as painkillers and/or anti-sickness tablets to improve their effectiveness. your gp will discuss this with you.anti-sickness medicines, known as anti-emetics, can treat migraine in some people. they can be effective even if you don’t experience nausea or vomiting. they can be taken alongside painkillers and triptans.anti-sickness medicines work better if taken as soon as your migraine symptoms begin. they usually come in the form of a tablet.side effects of anti-emetics include drowsiness anddiarrhoea.some anti-sickness medication can cause involuntary movements, normally in the face. speak to your gp if you experience involuntary movements.you can buy some combination medicines for migraine without a prescription at your local pharmacy. these medicines contain both painkillers and anti-sickness medicines. if you’re not sure which one is best for you, ask your pharmacist.it can also be very effective to combine a triptan with another painkiller, like ibuprofen.many people find combination medicines convenient. however, the dose of painkillers or anti-sickness medicine may not be enough to relieve your symptoms. if this is the case, it may be better to take painkillers and anti-sickness medicines separately. this allows you to control the doses of each.opiates like codeine should not be prescribed as a treatment for migraines. they’re not any more effective than triptans and painkillers and can cause nausea and medication overuse headache.in general, migraine treatment with medicines should be limited as much as possible when you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. instead, trying to identify and avoid potential migraine triggers is recommended.if medication is essential, paracetamol and sumatriptan are safe to take during pregnancy and when breastfeeding.if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, speak to your gp or midwife: if you’re getting regular migraines before taking medicationhigh doses of aspirin should not be taken to treat headaches during pregnancy.it’s important to maintain a generally healthy lifestyle, including: regular exercise, sleep and meals ensuring you stay well hydrated limiting your intake of caffeine limiting your intake of alcoholone of the best ways of preventing migraines is recognising the things that trigger an attack and trying to avoid them.medication is available to help prevent migraines. these medicines are usually used if your migraines remain frequent (more than 1 migraine per week) following a period of avoiding possible triggers.the following medications can be prescribed by your gp. if they’re not effective, you’ll be referred to a neurologist. the neurologist will consider what advanced therapies might be best to try next.medications used to prevent migraines are taken every day to reduce the severity and frequency of headaches. it takes a few weeks to reach the right dose and you might need to take it for several weeks (usually 8 weeks once the right dose is reached) to find out if it works.propranolol is a medication used to treatanginaandhigh blood pressure.it’s also effective in preventing migraines. it is taken every day in tablet form, regardless of whether you have a headache or not.propranolol is not suitable for people withasthma,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)and some heart problems. it should be used with caution in people withdiabetes.side effects of propranolol can include: cold hands and feet pins and needles problems sleeping tiredness light headednessyou might be prescribed tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline. this is a type of medication used for depression but at lower doses can also help prevent migraines.the side effects can include: drowsiness a dry mouth weight gain difficulty passing urinetopiramate is a type of medication originally developed to prevent seizures in people withepilepsy. it’s now much more commonly used in migraine. it’s been shown to help prevent migraines. it is taken every day in tablet form regardless of whether you have a headache or not.topiramate should be used with caution in people with kidney stones, liver problems or glaucoma.you should not take topiramate during pregnancy as it can harm your unborn baby. you must be on an effective form of contraception when taking topiramate. topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. your gp should discuss alternative methods of contraception if you’re prescribed topiramate.side effects of topiramate can include: decreased appetite and weight loss nausea and vomiting constipationordiarrhoea tingling sensation memory problems and difficulty finding words problems sleepingyou might be prescribed candesartan. candesartan is a medication used for high blood pressure.candesartan can cause lightheadedness due to low blood pressure, tiredness and cough. it should not be used if you’re pregnant or trying for a baby.other less

medicines are advanced therapies for migraine that can only be prescribed by a neurologist.botulinum toxin type a is used to prevent headaches in some adults with chronic migraines. chronic migraines mean you have headaches more than 15 days per month and at least half of them are migraines, over a period of 3 months.botulinum toxin type a is a type of neurotoxin (nerve toxin) that paralyses muscles. it’s not exactly clear why this treatment can be effective for migraine.sign recommend this treatment as an option for people who have chronic migraine that hasn’t responded to at least three previous preventative medical treatments.botulinum toxin type a should be injected to between 31 and 39 sites around the head and back of the neck. a new course of treatment can be given every 12 weeks.cgrp might be prescribed if other medication has not prevented your migraines.this medication has been created specifically for migraines.cgrp monoclonal antibodies are given by an injection into the skin on your thigh or abdomen (tummy) once per month. you’ll have to self administer this treatment meaning you’ll need to learn how to deliver the injection yourself.read more about cgrpmenstrual-related migraines usually occur between 2 days before the start of your period to 3 days after. they can be preventable using either non-hormonal or hormonal treatments.the non-hormonal treatments that are recommended are: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)– a common type of painkiller (usually naproxen) triptans – a type of medication used to treat a migraine attack (usually naratriptan or frovatriptan)these medications are taken as tablets 2 to 4 times a day from either the start of your period or 2 days before, until the last day of bleeding.hormonal treatments that may be recommended include: combined hormonal contraceptives, like thecombined contraceptive pill,patchorvaginal ring(usually taken continuously for at least 3 months) progesterone-only contraceptives, such asprogesterone-only pills,implantsorinjections oestrogen patches or gels, which can be used from 3 days before the start of your period and continued for 7 dayshormonal contraceptives like the combined contraceptive pill or vaginal ring are not used if you have migraines with aura symptoms. this is because this can increase your risk of having astroke.if the treatments above aren’t controlling your migraines, you might be referred to a specialist migraine clinic for further investigation and treatment.a specialist might recommend other treatments like transcranial magnetic stimulation devices or greater occipital nerve blocks.migraines are linked to a very small increased risk of mental health problems. migraines with aura are associated with a small increased risk of ischaemic strokes.an ischaemicstrokeoccurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or fatty material in the arteries.people who experience migraines with aura have about twice the risk of having an ischaemic stroke compared to people without migraines. however, this risk is still small. the risk increases significantly if you smoke and take the combined contraceptive pill.it’s unclear why ischaemic strokes are linked to migraine.the risk of having an ischaemic stroke is increased by the use of thecombined contraceptive pill. medical professionals generally advise women who experience migraine with aura not to use the combined contraceptive pill.women who have migraine without aura can usually take the combined contraceptive pill safely, unless they have other stroke risk factors likehigh blood pressureor a family history ofcardiovascular disease.talk to your gp about alternative forms of contraception if you experience aura symptoms and are taking the combined contraceptive pill.migraine is associated with a very small increased risk of mental health problems, including: depression bipolar disorder anxiety disorder panic

       " 'Miscarriage': 'a miscarriage is the loss of your baby before 24 weeks. early miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. late miscarriages happen between 12 and 24 weeks.most of the time there’s no clear reason why it happens, but it’s very unlikely to be caused by anything you did or didn’t do.about 1 out of 5 pregnancies miscarry. since many miscarriages aren’t recorded the figure might be higher.if you’re registered, contact your midwife or local maternity unit. if you’re not registered, contact your gp or the nhs 24 111 service.doctors think most miscarriages are caused when the building blocks controlling the development of a baby (the chromosomes) aren’t right. babies with too many or not enough chromosomes won’t develop properly. this leads to a miscarriage.miscarriages can also be caused by: issues with your placenta cervical weakness – when your cervix (neck of your womb) starts to openan early miscarriage happens in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. most women who miscarry do so in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy.many women have a miscarriage before they even know they’re pregnant. if this happens it can feel like a late period with heavy bleeding.you might be having an early miscarriage if: you’re bleeding from your vagina you’ve cramps in your lower abdomen – these can feel like bad period pains there’s fluid or tissue coming from your vagina your breasts are no longer tender and any morning sickness has passedhaving some light bleeding’s fairly common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and doesn’t necessarily mean you’re having a miscarriage.if you start bleeding, you should always contact your gp or midwife and get advice about what to do.if you’re in the early weeks of pregnancy: you’ll probably be asked to go to the early pregnancy unit at your local hospital straight away you’ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan your body usually completes the miscarriage naturallydepending on your stage of pregnancy, you may deliver a small baby. that can be a shock and is an understandably upsetting time.a late miscarriage happens after 12 weeks and before 24 weeks.for many parents who lose their baby after a late miscarriage, the word ‘miscarriage’ doesn’t properly express the impact of their loss. the loss of a baby at any time’s a terrible shock and a late miscarriage can be especially hard.you might be having a late miscarriage if: you’re bleeding from your vagina – this can be heavy and you might have blood clots you’ve strong, cramping painsalways get medical help if: you’re

usually an ultrasound scan you’re likely to go through labour in hospital and might have your labour inducedwhile you deliver your baby you’re likely to have heavier bleeding and labour-like pains.if you’re having a miscarriage, your doctor or midwife will: talk to you about what will happen next help you, and your partner if you have one, decide what you’d like to doyou may have many difficult decisions to make at this time and will have overwhelming emotions. take your time. your midwife or doctor can help, and there are many organisations that can support you, your baby’s father and your

they don’t want to see their baby, and others choose not to for faith or cultural reasons. this is a decision only you can make. it can be very hard when you’re feeling overwhelmed. whatever you decide is okay.if you’re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide.you’ll probably have some bleeding for a week or two. if you continue to have symptoms after your miscarriage, it may mean that some of the pregnancy tissue’s still in your womb.some women may need medicine or a short operation to treat this.if you’re worried about seeking treatment, maybe a friend can come with you. having support’s really important at this difficult time.many women will want to take time off work after having a miscarriage.if you have a miscarriage

       " 'Motor neurone disease (MND)': \"motor neurone disease (mnd) is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. this leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting.amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is the most common form of mnd.mnd happens when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, called motor neurones, stop working properly and die prematurely. this is known as neurodegeneration.motor neurones control muscle activity like:as mnd progresses, it can become more difficult to do some or all of these activities.the symptoms of mnd start gradually over weeks and months. they tend to appear on one side of the body first and get progressively worse. you have early symptoms of mndbeing referred to a specialist as early as possible can help you access the right support.there are usually 3 stages of symptoms.sometimes the early symptoms are mistaken for similar conditions that also affect the nervous system.in about two-thirds of people with mnd, the first symptoms are in the arm or leg. this is sometimes called limb-onset disease. the symptoms include: a weakened grip, which can cause problems picking up or holding objects weakness at the shoulder, making lifting your arm above your head difficult tripping up over your foot because of weakness at your ankle or hipthese symptoms are usually painless. you might also experience widespread twitching of the muscles (fasciculations) or muscle cramps. you might also see wasting of the muscles with significant weight loss.in 1 out of 4 cases, the first mnd symptoms will affect the muscles used for speaking and swallowing.these problems might initially affect the muscles used for speech and swallowing. increasingly slurred speech (dysarthria) is usually the first sign of this type of mnd. it might be misdiagnosed as astroke.as the condition progresses, it may become increasingly difficult to swallow (dysphagia). this might be misdiagnosed as a blockage in the throat.in rare cases, mnd starts by affecting the lungs, rather than affecting them at the end of the condition. this is called respiratory-onset disease.in some cases the initial symptoms like breathing difficulties and shortness of breath are more obvious.you might suffer from a lack of sleep and a headache in the morning. this might be because your body isn’t getting rid of the carbon dioxide you normally breathe out.as mnd becomes more advanced, more parts and functions of the body are affected. this can make you more likely to experience infections, like chest infections, which can cause your condition to get worse quicker.the limbs will become weaker. the muscles in the limbs may become thinner. as a result, the person will find it increasingly difficult to move the affected limbs.the limbs may also become stiff. this is known as spasticity. both muscle wasting and stiffness can also cause joint aches and pains.speaking and swallowing can become increasingly difficult as mnd progresses.choking episodes can be distressing but they aren’t usually the cause of death.reduced swallowing can cause excess saliva. this can cause drooling. thicker saliva can sometimes be difficult to clear from the chest or throat. this is because the muscles that control coughing become weak.some people with mnd have episodes of uncontrollable excessive yawning. this can happen even when they’re not tired. it can sometimes cause jaw pain.mnd can cause changes in your ability to control your emotions. this is more likely when there’s weakness in the muscles that control speech and swallowing.one of the most common signs is when a person has episodes of sudden uncontrollable crying or, more rarely, laughter. this is sometimes called emotional lability or emotionality.sometimes, people with mnd have significant difficulties with: concentration planning communication behavioural changes.this is where the condition is causing a type ofdementia(usually frontotemporal dementia).up to 15% of people with mnd develop more profound frontotemporal dementia. this usually happens soon after, or sometimes before, their first muscle-related symptoms. someone with mnd might not be aware that there are problems with their behaviour or personality.breathing might become less efficient as the nerves and muscles that help control the lungs become more damaged.this might mean you feel short of breath after doing every day tasks like walking up the stairs. over time, you might become even more out of breath when you’re resting.shortness of breath can become a problem at night. some people find it difficult to breathe when they’re lying down. others might wake in the night because they feel breathless.as breathlessness increases, breathing support can help reduce this symptom. this is usually given by non-invasive ventilatory (niv) support. it can be useful at night to improve your sleep quality. this can help reduce drowsiness during the day.as mnd progresses to its final phase, you might experience: increasing body paralysis, which means you’ll need help with most daily activities significant shortness of breatheventually, non-invasive breathing assistance won’t be enough to make up for the loss of normal lung function. at this stage, more medication can help to reduce symptoms of breathlessness and anxiety related to it. most people with mnd become increasingly drowsy before falling into a deep sleep, where they usually die peacefully.some people with mnd have other symptoms that aren’t directly caused by the condition, but are related to the stress of living with it. these might includedepression,insomniaandanxiety.mnd occurs when specialist nerve cells (motor neurones) in the brain and spinal cord progressively fail. it’s not clear why this happens.one known cause of mnd is an error in your genes with 20% of cases linked to genetic causes. half of genetic cases will be in people who have a family history of mnd. the other half of genetic cases will occur in those without a family history.having a family history of frontotemporal dementia can also increase the risk of inheriting mnd.the error in the gene affects the cells ability to perform normally and survive.if you have a genetic form of mnd, there’s a chance that you could pass the risk of developing mnd on to your child. the risk of them developing the condition can be affected by many factors like age.not everyone who has the genetic mutation will develop mnd in their lifetime. typically, the longer you live, the more likely you are to develop the condition.if you have a parent with mnd with no other family history of the disease, you’re at a slight increased risk of mnd of about 1.4%. the risk to the general population of mnd is about 0.3%.it’s unclear why the motor neurones begin to lose function. most experts believe that it’s a combination of factors that affect either the motor neurones or the cells that support them. there are some theories involving different cell processes including:aggregates are abnormal clumps of protein that develop inside motor neurones. they’re found in nearly all cases of mnd and may disrupt the normal working of the motor neurones. it can also be a marker that the cell is under stress.the protein tdp-43 is most commonly found in these aggregates. this is a protein involved in the processing of the genetic instructions for the cell through a molecule known as rna. mutations in the gene (tardbp) coding for this protein can be a cause of genetic cases of mnd.all cells have transport systems that move nutrients and other chemicals into the cell and waste products out of the cell. research suggests that the transport systems in motor neurones become disrupted. over time, toxic waste can build up in cells as a natural by-product of normal cell activity and aging.the body gets rid of the toxic waste by waste disposal systems that can be affected by ageing and the environment.glial cells surround and support motor neurones and provide them with nutrients.when they don’t work properly the motor neurones no longer receive the support and nutrition they need to function normally.their involvement in mnd is still being researched.nerve cells use special “messenger chemicals” called neurotransmitters to pass information between cells. one of the neurotransmitters is called glutamate. it excites neurones and one theory is that too much activity through this causes damage to the neurones.riluzole, a drug used to treat mnd reduces the level of neuronal activity by blocking the action of glutamate.mitochondria are the “batteries” of cells. they provide the energy that a cell needs to carry out its normal function. mitochondria in the motor neurones of people with mnd might not function properly.speak to your gp if you experience the initial symptoms of mnd.after hearing about your symptoms and an initial exam, your gp might refer you to a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system).diagnosing mnd can be difficult during the early stages. this is because many of the first symptoms can be caused by other more common health conditions like: a trapped nerve – wear and tear of the bones in the spine can sometimes cause nerves to become trapped under the spine peripheral neuropathy– where part of the nervous system is damaged by another condition, liketype 2 diabetes swallowing difficulties caused by narrowing or inflammation of the gullet speech difficulties due to problems with the voice box damage to the brain by stroke or other neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis (ms) in younger peoplemnd is usually diagnosed by a neurologist based on the symptoms and a physical examination.there’s no single test for mnd. various tests might be used to rule out other possible causes of the your symptoms. tests might include: blood tests– these can be used for several reasons, like checking that organs are working, or to look for a marker of muscle damage (creatinine kinase) magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– to give a detailed picture of your brain and spinal cord electromyography (emg) – measures the electrical activity in your muscles, which shows how well your motor neurones are working and connecting to the muscles nerve conduction test – similar to an emg but measures how quickly your nerves can conduct an electrical signal lumbar puncture – a sample of spinal fluid might be tested to exclude an inflammatory or nerve condition caused by an infection musclebiopsy– in rare cases, a small sample of muscle might be removed for testing to determine whether the problem lies in the musclesgene testscan be used to support the diagnosis in some individuals. they might provide an explanation of why they’ve developed the disorder. your gp can give you more information about specialists who can help with genetic testing.there are many reasons why there may be delays in diagnosis. the initial symptoms might not appear to be serious. or symptoms might not be recognised as being related to the nervous system so a neurologist isn’t consulted at first.sometimes, the diagnosis of mnd is clear without the need for further tests. confirming a diagnosis can sometimes be time-consuming even for an experienced neurologist. they might need a period of observation to be sure, particularly in cases where the condition progresses slowly. mnd can only be diagnosed if the symptoms are clearly getting worse (progressive).being told you have mnd can be devastating and the news can be difficult to take in at first.after you’re diagnosed you should be provided with contact details of an mnd care specialist. these are healthcare professionals with specialist experience caring for people with mnd. they’ll be able to give you (and your family) extra support after the diagnosis and during your time with the illness.talking to a counsellor or a trained clinical psychologist might help with feelings ofdepressionandanxiety.it’s not unusual to have thoughts of taking your own life, although very few people with mnd go on to do this. you should discuss these thoughts with your doctor.takingantidepressantsor medicines to reduce anxiety may help. your care team will be able to tell you about this.although there’s no cure for mnd, there are treatments available to help relieve the symptoms.a team of healthcare professionals will work together to help care for you. this multidisciplinary team typically includes: a neurologist and an mnd care specialist a specialist in breathing (respiratory specialist) physiotherapists to advise on mobility aids occupational therapists to assess the need for adaptations to living environments speech and language therapist to provide help with communication and swallowing dieticians to support nutritionas the conditions advances, you might also need palliative care.riluzole is the only licensed medication in the uk that’s shown a survival benefit for people with mnd. riluzole is thought to slow down the damage to the motor neurone cells by reducing their sensitivity to the nerve transmitter glutamate.in medical research, riluzole extended survival by 2 to 3 months on average.side effects of riluzole are usually mild and can include nausea, tiredness and, less commonly, a rapid heartbeat.very rarely, riluzole has been known to cause liver damage. if you’re prescribed riluzole you’ll need to haveblood testsfor the first few months to check your liver is working properly. if you’ve had significant liver disease, riluzole may not be suitable for you.there are treatments available that can help relieve many of the symptoms of mnd and improve your quality of life.physiotherapy can help muscle cramps. in some cases, a medication called quinine can help treat muscle cramps too. they often improve later in the condition.quinine can cause side effects like: hearing and vision problems tinnitus– the perception of noise in one ear, both ears or inside the head vertigo– a sensation that you, or the environment around you, is movingquinine will usually only be used if the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the risks.muscle stiffness, also known as spasticity, can be treated using medication like baclofen. this helps to help relax the muscles. side effects can include increased weakness or tiredness.medication is available to treat drooling of saliva. one option is a hyoscine hydrobromide skin patch.alternative medicines used to control drooling include: amitriptyline atropine eye drops applied to the tongue glycopyrronium botulinum toxin injections into the glands that produce salivanot everyone with mnd will have significant speech problems.there are ways to help people who find it hard to communicate. a speech and language therapist can teach you techniques to make your voice as clear as possible.as the disease progresses, you may need assistive technology to help you communicate. a range of communication aids is available. your therapist will be able to tell you about the most effective communication aids for you.not everyone with mnd will have significant swallowing problems (dysphagia). for those that do, it can prevent normal eating and drinking. this can lead to you feeling more tired. if food or fluid goes down the wrong way into the lungs it can cause chest infections (called aspiration).one common treatment for dysphagia is a feeding tube known as a gastrostomy tube. the tube is surgically implanted into your stomach through a small cut on the surface of the stomach. it shouldn’t restrict your daily activities. you can continue to bathe and swim if you wish.ideally you should have the tube inserted before you become too frail. this is so you can get the best out of it and to give yourself the best chance of recovering from the procedure.if you have thick secretions (fluids) you can’t cough up yourself, medicine like carbocisteine and acetylcysteine might help.as mnd progresses, the muscles that help you breathe will become weaker. your breathing will become increasingly shallow, with a weaker cough.breathing difficulties usually develop gradually. they’re sometimes the first sign of mnd, although this is rare.it’s important to discuss breathing problems with your gp before they occur. your gp or neurologist should be able to refer you to a respiratory (breathing) specialist or a palliative care specialist, depending on your needs.you might benefit from non-invasive mechanical ventilation (niv) to support your breathing. room air (not oxygen) is sucked into a small box. it’s filtered and then gently pumped into the lungs through a face mask or nasal tube each time you take a breath.niv may not be suitable for everyone with mnd. your healthcare team will be able to discuss the options available to you.many people with mnd draw up an advance decision (sometimes called an advanced directive). this is where you decide your treatment preferences in advance in case you can’t communicate your decisions later because you’re too ill.issues that can be covered by an advance decision include: whether you want to be treated at home, in a hospice or in a hospital once you reach the final stages of mnd the type of medication you’d be willing to take in certain circumstances whether you’d be willing to consider a feeding tube if you were no longer able to swallow food and liquid if you have respiratory failure (loss of lung function), whether you wish to have artificial resuscitation, like having a permanent breathing tube inserted into your throat (known as a tracheostomy) whether you’d be willing to donate any of your organs after you die (the brain and spinal cord of people with mnd are very important for ongoing research)your care team will be able to provide you with more information and advice about making an advance decision.read more about end of life careyou might be given the opportunity to take part in research, including drug trials. your mnd care specialist and neurology consultant can provide further information on this.caring for someone with mnd can be both physically and emotionally demanding. it’s likely you’ll need a wide range of support.for information and advice about all aspects of caring, visitcare

       " 'Mouth cancer': 'mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops on the surface of the tongue, mouth, lips or gums.tumours can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common.symptoms of mouth cancer include: red or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue ulcers a lumpspeak to your gp if these symptoms do not heal within 3 weeks, especially if you’re a heavy drinker or smoker.a cancer that develops on the inside or outside layer of the body is called a carcinoma and these types of cancer are categorised by the type of cells the cancer starts in.squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer, accounting for nine out of 10 cases. squamous cells are found in many places around the body, including the inside of the mouth and under the skin.less common types of mouth cancer include: oral malignant melanoma – where the cancer starts in cells called melanocytes, which help give skin its colour adenocarcinomas – cancers that develop inside the salivary glandsmouth cancer occurs when something goes wrong with the normal cell lifecycle, causing them to grow and reproduce uncontrollably.risk factors for developing mouth cancer include: smoking or using products that contain tobacco drinking alcohol – smokers who are also heavy drinkers have a much higher risk compared to the population at large infection with the human papilloma virus (hpv), the virus that causesgenital wartsread more about thecauses of mouth cancermouth cancer is an uncommon type of cancer.most cases of mouth cancer first develop in older adults who are aged between 50 and 74 years old.mouth cancer can occur in younger adults, but it’s thought that hpv infection may be responsible for the majority of cases that occur in younger people.mouth cancer is more common in men than in women. this is thought to be due to the fact that, on average, men drink more alcohol than women.there are 3 main treatment options for mouth cancer. they are: surgery – where the cancerous cells are surgically removed and, in some cases, some of the surrounding tissue chemotherapy– where powerful medications are used to kill cancerous cells radiotherapy– where high energyx-raysare used to kill cancerous cellsthese treatments are often used in combination. for example, a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.read more abouttreating mouth cancerboth surgery and radiotherapy can make speaking and swallowing difficult (dysphagia).dysphagia can be a potentially serious problem. if small pieces of food enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs, it could trigger a chest infection, known as aspirationpneumonia.read more about thecomplications of mouth cancerthe three most effective ways to prevent mouth cancer from developing – or prevent it reocurring after successful treatment – are: not smoking keeping to therecommended limits for alcohol consumption eating a ‘mediterranean-style diet’, with plenty of fresh vegetables (particularly tomatoes), citrus fruits, olive oil and fish (read more abouthealthy eating)it’s also important that you have regulardental check-upsbecause dentists can often spot the early stages of mouth cancer.mouth cancer can develop on most parts of the mouth, including the lips, gums and occasionally, the throat.the most common symptoms of mouth cancer include: red or white patches in the mouth or throat a lump ulcersother symptoms may include: persistent pain in the mouth pain or difficulty when swallowing (dysphagia) changes in your voice, or speech problems swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your neck unexplained weight loss bleeding or numbness in the mouth a tooth, or teeth, that becomes loose for no obvious reason difficulty moving your jawmany of these symptoms can be caused by less serious conditions, such as minor infections.but it’s strongly recommended that you visit your gp if any of these symptoms have lasted for more than 3 weeks. it’s especially important to seek medical advice if you’re a heavy drinker or smoker.mouth cancer tends not to cause any noticeable symptoms during the initial stages of the disease.this is why it’s important to have regular dental check-ups, particularly if you are a smoker, a heavy drinker or a betel chewer, because a dentist may often be able to detect the condition during an examination.you should have a dental check-up at least every year. however, more frequent check-ups may be recommended if you have a history oftooth decayorgum disease.the 2 leading causes of mouth cancer in the uk are drinking too much alcohol and smoking.both alcohol and tobacco are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the dna in cells and lead tocancer.the risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker.exactly what triggers the changes in dna that lead to mouth cancer and why only a small number of people develop mouth cancer is still uncertain.there are 2 ways mouth cancer can spread: directly – the cancer can spread out of the mouth and into nearby tissues, such as surrounding skin or into the back of the jaw via the lymphatic system – the lymphatic system is a series of glands found throughout your body which produce many specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infectionmouth cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic oral cancer.other risk factors for mouth cancer may include: chewing tobacco or other smokeless tobacco products like snus chewing betel nuts with or without tobacco a poor diet the human papilloma virus (hpv) poor oral hygienethere is a range of smokeless tobacco products including: chewing tobacco snuff – powdered tobacco designed to be snorted snus – a type of smokeless tobacco popular in sweden, which is placed under your upper lipsmokeless tobacco products are not harmless and may increase your risk of developing mouth cancer, as well as other cancers, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and oesophageal cancer.betel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast asian ethnic communities, such as people of indian and sri lankan origin.they have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. this risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco.due to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic indian and sri lankan communities than in the population at large.there is evidence that a poor diet may increase your risk of some types of mouth cancer.a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is thought to reduce your risk of developing mouth cancer.the human papilloma virus (hpv) is a family of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat.you can contract an hpv infection by having sexual contact with a person already infected – you do not have to have ‘full sex’; just close skin-to-skin contact.there is evidence that in rare cases, certain types of hpv can cause abnormal tissue growth inside the mouth, triggering mouth cancer.there is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as havingtooth decay,gum disease, not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer.if you have symptoms of mouth cancer, your gp will carry out a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.if mouth cancer is suspected, you will be referred to hospital for further tests or to speak to a specialist head and neck surgeon.in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of mouth cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected mouth cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.it may be necessary to remove a small sample of affected tissue to check for the presence of cancerous cells. this procedure is known as abiopsy.there are 3 main methods used to carry out a biopsy in cases of suspected mouth cancer.a punch biopsy may be used if the suspected affected area of tissue is in an easily accessible place, such as your tongue or the inside of your mouth.the area is first injected with a local anaesthetic to numb it. the doctor will then cut away a small section of affected tissue and remove it with tweezers.the procedure is not painful, but can feel a little uncomfortable.a fine needle aspiration (fna) is a type of biopsy used if it is suspected a swelling in your neck is the result of mouth cancer.your neck is numbed and a needle is used to draw out a small sample of tissue and fluids from the lump. the sample is then checked for cancerous cells.fna is not painful but it can be uncomfortable and cause bruising.a panendoscope is used if the suspected tissue is at the back of your throat or inside one of your nasal cavities.this is a long thin tube with a camera and a light which is guided through the nose, then used to remove a small section of tissue for the biopsy.the panendoscope can also check whether cancer has spread from your mouth to further down your throat, such as your larynx (voice box), oesophagus (gullet) or trachea (windpipe).if the biopsy confirms cancer you will need further tests to check what stage it has reached.if the cancer is diagnosed late it can have spread from your mouth into the lymphatic system – a series of glands throughout your body which produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system.once the cancer reaches the lymphatic system, it is capable of spreading to any other part of your body, including your bones, blood and organs.however, it’s uncommon for mouth cancer to spread further than the lymph nodes near your mouth, although in some cases it may also spread to surrounding bones, such as the jaw bone, and in some cases your lungs.therefore, the tests will examine your lymph nodes, bones and the tissue near the site of your initial tumour to check for the presence of other tumours.these tests may include: anx-ray amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan acomputerised tomography (ct) scan apositron emission tomography (pet) scanfurther biopsies on nearby lymph nodes may also be carried out.once these tests have been completed it should be possible to tell what stage and grade your cancer is: staging is a measure of how far the cancer has spread the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how fast it is likely to spread in futurethis will help determine whether you have: early mouth cancer (usually curable) intermediate mouth cancer (may be curable) or advanced mouth cancer (not usually curable, but it is usually possible to slow the spread of the cancer and extend lifespan)there are 3 grades of mouth cancer: low-grade (the slowest), moderate-grade and high-grade (the most aggressive).grading your cancer helps the doctor decide how quickly you need to be treated. read more abouttreating mouth cancer.your treatment will depend on the type and size of the cancer, the grade and how far it’s spread – as well as your general health.if the cancer hasn’t spread beyond the mouth or the oropharynx (the bit of your throat at the back of your mouth), a complete cure may be possible using a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, then a cure is unlikely but it will be possible to slow the progress of the cancer and help relieve symptoms by using surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. your care team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.before going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. for example, what are the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.radiotherapy makes the teeth more sensitive and vulnerable to infection so before treatment begins, you’ll be given a full dental examination and any necessary work will be carried out.if you smoke or drink, stopping will increase the chances of your treatment being successful.your specialist nurse and your gp can provide help and support if you are finding it difficult to quit smoking and drinking.read more aboutquitting smokingandcutting down on alcoholfor mouth cancer, the aim of surgical treatment is to remove any affected tissue while minimising damage to the rest of the mouth.if the cancer is in its very early stages, it may be possible to remove any tumours using a type of laser surgery known as photodynamic therapy (pdt). pdt involves taking a medicine that makes your tissue sensitive to the effects of light. a laser is then used to remove the tumour.if your cancer is more advanced, it may be necessary to remove part of your mouth lining and, in some cases, facial skin, which can be replaced using skin grafted from your forearm or chest.if your tongue is affected, part of the tongue will have to be removed. this is known as a partial glossectomy. the tongue is then reconstructed using grafted tissue.if the cancer has spread to your jawbone it will need to be surgically removed. the jawbone can be replaced by taking bone from another part of your body and grafting it in place.occasionally, other bones, such as cheekbones, may have to be removed to completely remove the cancer.these can be replaced with plastic prosthetic bones which are usually very realistic, leaving your physical appearance largely unaffected.during surgery, your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes near the site of the initial tumour. this is often done as a preventative measure in case they contain small numbers of cancerous cells that can’t be detected.radiotherapyuses doses of radiation to kill cancerous cells. it may be possible to remove the cancer using radiotherapy alone, but it is usually used after surgery to prevent the cancer from reocurring.the treatment is normally given every day over the course of three to seven weeks, depending on the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.while it kills cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also affect healthy tissue, and it has a number of side effects, including: sore, red skin (like sunburn) mouth ulcers sore mouth and throat dry mouth loss of, or changes in taste loss of appetite tiredness feeling sick stiff jaw bad breathany side effects will be monitored by your care team and treated where possible.the side effects of radiotherapy can be distressing, but most of them will pass once the radiotherapy is complete.internal radiotherapy – also called brachytherapy – is often used to treat cancers of the tongue that are in their early stages. it involves placing radioactive implants directly into the tumour while you are under a general anaesthetic.they will be left for between 1 and 8 days during which time the cancer cells will receive a much higher dose of radiation than the rest of your mouth.visits by friends and family will need to be restricted due to radiation and pregnant women and children won’t be able to visit you.the radioactive implants will cause your mouth to become swollen, and you will experience some pain 5 to 10 days after the implants are removed.chemotherapyis sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning.chemotherapy involves the use of powerful cancer-killing medicines. these medicines damage the dna of the cancerous cells, interrupting their ability to reproduce.medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. adverse side effects are common and include: fatigue (tiredness) sore mouth mouth ulcers feeling sick being sick hair loss tirednessthe side effects should stop once the treatment has finished.chemotherapy also weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to infection.cetuximab is a new type of medication, known as a biologic, used to treat advanced cases of mouth cancer. it is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy.cetuximab targets proteins on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors. these receptors help the cancer to grow, so by targeting these proteins, cetuximab prevents the cancer from spreading.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) ruled that cetuximab did not represent a cost-effective treatment in most cases and has recommended it only be used in people who: are in a good state of health (likely to make a good recovery if treated) are unable to have chemotherapy for medical reasons (for example, because they have kidney disease or are pregnant)complications of treatment for mouth cancer can include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), speech problems and emotional disruption.dysphagiais the medical term for difficulty swallowing. it’s easy to take your ability to swallow food and liquid for granted, but in reality, the process relies on a complex interaction of muscles, which can be easily disrupted.surgery andradiotherapycan affect your tongue, mouth or throat, resulting in dysphagia. dysphagia is a potentially serious problem because, aside from the risk of malnutrition, there is a chance that small particles of food could enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs. this can trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia.if you are having problems swallowing, a speech and language therapist (slt) will need to assess your swallowing reflex. one way an slt can do this is to perform a test known as a videofluoroscopy, which involves adding a special dye to liquid and food that you swallow. the dye highlights your swallowing reflexes and by using x-rays your slt can see if there is a risk of food entering your lungs.if this is the case, it may be necessary for the short term to provide you with a feeding tube, which will be directly connected to your stomach. the slt will teach you exercises so you can ‘relearn’ how to swallow properly.your ability to swallow will improve as you learn the exercises and the damaged tissue is allowed to heal. however, there is a chance your swallowing reflex will never fully recover.in some circumstances, you may have to alter your diet to make swallowing easier. a dietitian can give you dietary advice.read more detailed information abouthow dysphagia is treatedmuch like swallowing, your ability to speak clearly is governed by a complex interaction of muscles, bones and tissue, including your tongue, teeth, lips and soft palate (a section of tissue found at the back of the mouth).radiotherapy and surgery can affect this process and make it difficult to pronounce certain sounds. in severe cases, you may have problems making yourself understood.an slt will help you improve your verbal communication skills by teaching you a series of exercises that develop your range of vocal movements and teach you new ways of producing sounds.the emotional impact of living with mouth cancer can be significant. many people report experiencing a roller coaster effect.for example, you may feel down when you receive a diagnosis, but feel up when the cancer responds to treatment. then you may feel down again as you try to come to terms with the side effects and after effects of your treatment.this type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger depression. signs that you may be depressed include: feeling down or hopeless during the past month no longer taking pleasure in the things you used to enjoycontact your gp for advice if you think you may be depressed. there are a range of effective treatments for depression, includingantidepressant medicationand talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt).read more aboutdepressionandcoping with cancerhaving mouth cancer doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to give up work, but you may need quite a lot of time off, and you may not be able to carry on as you did before treatment.if you have cancer you’re covered by thedisability discrimination act. this means that your employer is not allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. they have a duty to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help you cope. examples of these include: allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform or your working environmentthe definition of what is ‘reasonable’ depends on the situation. for example, how much it would affect your employer’s business.it will help if you give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you will need off and when. talk to your human resources department if you have one. your union or staff association representative should also be able to give you advice.if you’re having difficulties with your employer, you may be able to receive help from your union or your localcitizens advice bureau.it is not always easy to talk about cancer, either for you or your family and friends. you may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you. being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.if you have to stop work or go part-time because of your cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. if you have cancer or you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support: if you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled tostatutory sick payfrom your employer if you don’t have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled toemployment and support allowance if you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled tocarer’s allowance you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household incomefind out as early as possible what help is available to you. speak to the social worker at your hospital who can give you the information you need.if you have questions, your gp or nurse may be able to reassure you. you may find it helpful

mouth cancer, either at a local support group or in an internet chatroom, such as: cancer research uk: cancer chat macmillan cancer support: head and neck cancer forumbeing a carer is not an easy role. when you are busy responding to the needs of others it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy and make it easy for you to neglect your own health and mental wellbeing. research on carers’ health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. if you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress.if you are caring for someone else, it is important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. it is in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.eat regularly and healthily. if you do not have time to sit down for every meal, try to make time to sit down for at least 1 of your day’s meals. instead of relying on fast food snacks, go for healthier options, such as fruit.as well as exhaustion, isolation and worries about the person you are caring for, it is understandable if there are times when you feel resentful and then guilty for feeling like this. these feelings are natural.friends and family may not always understand what you are going through and it can be helpful to talk to people in the same situation.care information scotlandhas

       " 'Multiple myeloma': 'multiple myeloma, also known as myeloma, is a type of bone marrow cancer.bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. it produces the body’s blood cells. multiple myeloma affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow.myeloma does not usually take the form of a lump or tumour. instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells.myeloma often affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs.in the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. it’s often only suspected or diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test.however, myeloma will eventually cause a wide range of problems, including: a persistent dull ache or specific areas of tenderness in your bones weak bones that break (fracture) easily tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath (caused byanaemia) repeated infections less commonly, bruising and unusual bleeding – such as frequentnosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periodsread more about thesymptoms of multiple myelomaspeak to your gp if you have any of these symptoms. while they’re unlikely to be caused by cancer, it’s best to get a proper diagnosis.your gp will examine you to check for bone tenderness, bleeding, signs of infection, and any other symptoms that suggest you may have myeloma.they may also arrange blood and urine tests that can detect abnormal proteins produced by myeloma cells.if myeloma is suspected, you will be referred to a consultant haematologist (a specialist in blood conditions) for further tests and treatment.read more aboutdiagnosing multiple myelomamultiple myeloma is an uncommon type of cancer.it’s not known exactly what causes the condition, although it’s more common in: people with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (mgus) – an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood men adults over 60 – most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70, and cases affecting people under the age of 40 are rare black

myeloma, but treatment can often help control it for several years.treatment will often involve: a combination of anti-myeloma medications to destroy the myeloma cells medicines and procedures to prevent and treat problems caused by myeloma, such as bone pain, fractures and anaemia anti-myeloma medicines to control the cancer when it comes back (relapses)as part of your treatment, you may be asked if you want to take part in a clinical trial to help researchers develop better treatments for multiple myeloma.read more abouttreating multiple myelomaif you’ve been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, you may find it useful to contact a local or national support group, such asmyeloma uk.support groups can offer more information and advice. they can also often put you in touch with other people in a similar situation so you can share advice and talk about your experiences.the myeloma uk website has more information about how they can help you andfinding a local support group.in the early stages, multiple myeloma may not cause any symptoms or complications, and may only be diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test.however, it will eventually cause a wide range of problems.multiple myeloma can cause pain in affected bones, most often the back, ribs or hips. the pain is frequently a persistent dull ache, which may be made worse by movement.multiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). the spine and ribs are most often affected.fractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and occasionally compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back).compression of the spinal cord can cause pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and sometimes problems controlling your bladder and bowels.multiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in our bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells (anaemia). this can also occur as a side effect of myeloma treatment.if you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless.people with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness).you may find you get infections frequently and that they last for a long time.a high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream.symptoms of hypercalcaemia can include extremethirst, feeling sick, needing to urinate frequently,constipation, confusion and drowsiness.bruising and unusual bleeding (haemorrhage) – such as frequentnosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods – sometimes occurs in multiple myeloma because the cancer cells in your bone marrow can stop blood clotting cells called platelets being made.in some people, multiple myeloma can cause the blood to become thicker than normal. this is known as hyperviscosity, which can cause problems such as blurred vision,headaches,dizziness, bleeding from the gums or nose, andshortness of breath.kidney damage can occur in people with multiple myeloma for several reasons. abnormal proteins produced by the cancer cells can damage the kidneys, as can other complications, such as hypercalcaemia. some medications used to treat multiple myeloma can also cause kidney damage.eventually, the kidneys may stop working properly. this is known as kidney or renal impairment, or kidney or renal failure. signs of kidney failure can include: weight loss and poor appetite swollen ankles, feet or hands tiredness and a lack of energy shortness of breath itchy skin feeling sickyou should speak to your gp if you have symptoms of multiple myeloma. while they’re unlikely to be caused by cancer, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.you should seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia or kidney failure, as these are medical emergencies that need to be investigated and treated as soon as possible.read more aboutdiagnosing multiple myelomaandtreating multiple myelomain multiple myeloma, cells inside the bone marrow called plasma cells become cancerous.bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. it produces the body’s blood cells.plasma cells are normally produced in a controlled way. in cases of multiple myeloma, large numbers of abnormal plasma cells are produced. these fill up the bone marrow and interfere with the production of other cells, such as red and white blood cells.the exact reason why this happens is unknown, but multiple myeloma is closely associated with a condition called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (mgus), and there are certain things that can increase your risk of developing it.in almost all cases, multiple myeloma occurs in someone who previously had mgus.mgus is the name for having an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood. this does not cause any symptoms and treatment is not required.however, every year around 1 in every 100 people with mgus go on to develop multiple myeloma. there is no known way to delay or prevent this, so ongoing outpatient tests to check for cancer will usually be recommended if you have mgus.as well as mgus, certain things can increase your risk of developing multiple myeloma, including: age – your risk of developing multiple myeloma increases as you get older; most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70, and cases affecting people under 40 are rare gender – men are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than women ethnicity – multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and asian populationsit has also been suggested that having a family history of mgus or multiple myeloma, having reduced immunity (for example, because of medication orhiv), being overweight orobese, and being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals may increase your risk of multiple myeloma. however, a link between these factors and the condition is less clear.multiple myeloma can be difficult to diagnose because it’s an uncommon type of cancer that initially has few or no symptoms.your gp will examine you and ask about your symptoms, medical history and overall health. during the examination, your gp will look for things such as bleeding, signs of infection and specific areas of bone tenderness.you may need urine andblood teststo check for certain types of antibodies and proteins (immunoglobulins).if multiple myeloma is suspected, you will be referred to a haematologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the blood) for further tests and scans.a number of blood tests are used to help diagnose multiple myeloma, and they may need to be repeated to monitor the condition.these may include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) or plasma viscosity (pv) – if you have multiple myeloma, your esr or pv will usually be raised tests to measure the type and number of abnormal antibodies produced by the cancerous plasma cells a full blood count (fbc) to check levels of different types of blood cells – your doctor will be looking for a low number of red blood cells and platelets liver and kidney function blood calcium levela urine sample will be checked for the abnormal proteins produced by the cancerous plasma cells. the abnormal proteins are known as monoclonal light chains, or bence jones protein.these proteins can damage your kidneys as they pass through them from your blood to your urine. you may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. this will be used to check the quantity of proteins being produced and how well your kidneys are working.you will havex-raystaken of your long bones (arms and legs), skull, spine and pelvis to look for any damage.other scans, such ascomputerised tomography (ct) scansandmagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans, may also be carried out.a bone marrowbiopsyis usually needed to confirm multiple myeloma. a needle will be used to take a small sample of bone marrow from one of your bones, usually the pelvis. a sample of bone may also be removed.this is carried out using alocal anaesthetic(the area where the needle is inserted is numbed).the sample of bone marrow and bone will be used to check for cancerous plasma cells.if you have multiple myeloma, you will be cared for by a team, which is usually led by a consultant haematologist who specialises in myeloma.the team will discuss your condition and recommend the best treatment for you. however, the final decision will be yours.before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, it may be useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a particular treatment.there are 2 main aims in treating multiple myeloma: to bring the myeloma under control to prevent and treat problems associated with myeloma, such asanaemiaand bone painwhile treatment can often control myeloma and improve quality of life, myeloma usually can’t be cured. this means additional treatment is needed when the cancer comes back (a relapse).not everyone diagnosed with myeloma will need immediate treatment if the condition is not causing any problems. this is sometimes referred to as asymptomatic, orsmouldering myeloma.if you don’t need treatment, you’ll be monitored for signs the cancer is beginning to cause problems. if you do need treatment, the following options are most commonly used.the initial treatment for multiple myeloma may be either: non-intensive – for older or less fit patients (this is more common) intensive – for younger or fitter patients (thought to be too toxic for older or less fit patients)the decision about which treatment is appropriate for you is usually based on your biological age or fitness.as a general rule, people younger than 65 are more likely to be candidates for intensive therapy. for those over 70, non-intensive treatment is more likely to be recommended.those aged in between will be given careful consideration as to what treatment group they fall into.both non-intensive and intensive treatments involve taking a combination of anti-myeloma medicines. intensive treatment involves much higher doses and is followed by a stem cell transplant.the medicines usually include a chemotherapy medicine, a steroid medicine, and either thalidomide or bortezomib.chemotherapymedicines kill the myeloma cells. the most common types used to treat myeloma are melphalan and cyclophosphamide.these treatments are mostly taken in tablet form. they are reasonably well tolerated and side effects are mild. possible side effects include: increased risk of infections feeling sick vomiting hair lossyour clinician will give you advice and information about your risk of developing potentially serious infections, and tell you what you can do to reduce your risk of picking up infections during your treatment.steroid medications (corticosteroids) help destroy myeloma cells and make chemotherapy more effective. the 2 most common types used to treat myeloma are dexamethasone and prednisolone.steroids are taken orally (by mouth) after eating. possible side effects includeheartburn,indigestion, increased appetite, mood changes and problems falling asleep.thalidomide can help kill myeloma cells. you take it as a tablet every day, usually in the evening as it can make you feel sleepy.other common side effects include: constipation dizziness rashes numbness or tingling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)thalidomide can cause birth defects, so it should not be taken by pregnant women, and a reliable form ofcontraceptionsuch as acondommust be used during treatment.there is also a risk you may develop a blood clot when taking thalidomide, so you may be given medication to help prevent this. contact your care team immediately if you develop symptoms of a blood clot, such as pain or swelling in one of your legs, orchest painandbreathlessness.bortezomib (velcade) can help kill myeloma cells by causing protein to build-up inside them.there are some limitations as to who can have bortezomib, but a member of your care team will discuss this with you.the medication is given by injection, usually under the skin. possible side effects include: tiredness nausea diarrhoea numbness or tingling in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)after initial therapy with primarily outpatient-based treatments, people receiving intensive treatment will be given a much higher dose of chemotherapy medication as an inpatient to potentially help destroy a larger number of myeloma cells. this aims to achieve a longer period of remission (where there is no sign of active disease in your body).however, these high doses also affect healthy bone marrow, so a stem cell transplant will be needed to help your bone marrow recover.in most cases, the stem cells will be collected from you before treatment (autologous transplantation). in rare cases, they are collected from a sibling or an unrelated donor.further treatment is needed if myeloma returns. treatment for relapses is generally similar to initial treatment, although non-intensive treatment is often preferred to further intensive treatment.additional medications such as lenalidomide, pomalidomide and other chemotherapy medicines may be added, or used again as your haematologist feels is appropriate.you may also be asked if you want to participate in clinical trial research into new treatments for multiple myeloma.lenalidomide and pomalidomide are similar to thalidomide. they’re both taken by mouth, and both can have an effect on the cells produced by your bone marrow, which can cause: increased risk of infection – as a result of a low number of white blood cells anaemia – caused by a low number of red blood cells bruising and bleeding – because of a low platelet countthey may also increase your risk of developing a blood clot and have other side effects similar to thalidomide.let your care team know if you experience any problems or unusual symptoms while taking lenalidomide or pomalidomide.as well as the main treatments for multiple myeloma, you may also need treatment to help relieve some of the problems caused by the condition.for example: painkillers – may be given to reduce pain radiotherapy– may be used to relieve bone pain or help healing after a bone is surgically repaired bisphosphonate medication – either given as tablets or by injection, this may help prevent bone damage and reduce the levels of calcium in your blood blood transfusionsor erythropoietin medication – may be used to increase your red blood cell count and treat anaemia surgery – may be carried out to repair or strengthen damaged bones, or treat compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back) dialysis– may be required if you develop kidney failure plasma exchange – treatment to remove and replace a blood component called plasma may be carried out if you have unusually thick blood (hyperviscosity)these treatments can each cause side effects and complications, so make sure you discuss the potential risks and benefits with your treatment team beforehand.research is ongoing to find new treatments for multiple myeloma and work out ways to improve the use of existing ones. to help with this, you may be asked to take part in a clinical trial during your treatment.clinical trials usually involve comparing a new treatment with an existing one to see whether the new treatment is more or less effective.it’s important to remember, however, that if you are given a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing treatment.there will never be any pressure for you to take part in a trial if you do not want to.search clinical trials for multiple myeloma cancer research uk: myeloma multiple myeloma research foundation myeloma

       " 'Multiple sclerosis (MS)': 'multiple sclerosis (ms) is a condition that affects the brain and/or spinal cord. it can cause symptoms like problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.it’s a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability. in many cases, it’s possible to treat symptoms. average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with ms.ms societyestimates that there are more than 130,000 people diagnosed with ms in the uk.it’s often diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. it’s about two to three times more common in women than men.multiple sclerosis (ms) can cause a wide range of symptoms and can affect any part of the body. it affects everyone differently.the symptoms are unpredictable. some people’s symptoms develop and worsen over time, while for others, they come and go.periods when symptoms get worse are known as relapses. periods when symptoms improve or disappear are known as remissions.some of the most common symptoms include:ms can cause your muscles to:in around 1 in 4 cases of ms, the first noticeable symptom is a problem with one of your eyes (optic neuritis). you may experience: some temporary loss of vision in the affected eye, usually lasting for days to weeks colour blindness eye pain, which is usually worse when moving the eye flashes of light when moving the eyeyou might also experience double vision or involuntary eye movements, which can make it seem as though objects are jumping around.you might have persistent numbness or tingling in different parts of your body which can last a few days to weeks.ms can make walking and moving around difficult, particularly if you also have muscle weakness and spasticity. you may experience: clumsiness difficulty with balance and co-ordination (ataxia) shaking of the limbs (tremor) dizziness andvertigo, which can make it feel as though everything around you is spinningsome people with ms experience pain which can take two forms.this is pain caused by damage to the nervous system, and can include: stabbing pains in the face stabbing sensations in the torso (body) and limbs feeling like you’re burning pins and needles feeling like you’re being hugged or squeezedmuscle spasms can sometimes be painful.this can be back, neck and joint pain particularly if you have problems walking or moving around.bladder problems are common in ms. they may include: having to pee more often having a sudden, urgent need to pee, which can lead to unintentionally passing urine (urge incontinence) difficulty emptying the bladder completely having to get up during the night to pee recurrenturinary tract infectionsthese problems can also have a range of causes other than ms.many people with ms also have problems with their bowel function.constipationis the most common problem. you may find passing stools (poo) difficult and pass them much less than normal.bowel incontinenceis less common, but is often linked to constipation. if a poo becomes stuck, it can irritate the wall of the bowel, causing it to produce more fluid and mucus that can leak out of your bottom.some of these problems aren’t specific to ms and can be the result of medications.ms can have an effect on sexual function.for women, problems include difficulty reaching orgasm. they might experience decreased vaginal lubrication and sensation.men with ms might find it hard to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction). they may also find it takes a lot longer to ejaculate when having sex or masturbating. they might lose the ability to ejaculate altogether.both men and women with ms may find they’re less interested in sex than they were before. this could be directly related to ms, a mood disorder like depression, or it could be the result of living with the condition.some people with ms have difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia) at some point. they might also slur their speech or be difficult to understand (dysarthria).feeling fatigued is a common and troublesome symptom of ms.it can cause an overwhelming sense of exhaustion that means it’s a struggle to carry out simple tasks.fatigue tends to get worse: towards the end of each day in hot weather after exercising during illnessmany people with ms experience periods of depression. it’s unclear if this is directly caused by ms, or is due to the stress of having to live with a long-term condition, or both.anxietycan also be a problem for people with ms, possibly due to the unpredictable nature of the condition.in rare cases, people with ms can experience rapid and severe mood swings.some people with ms have problems with thinking, learning and planning. this is known as cognitive dysfunction and can include: problems learning and remembering new things although long-term memory is usually unaffected slowness in processing lots of information or multi-tasking a shortened attention span getting stuck on words problems with understanding and processing visual information, such as reading a map difficulty with planning and problem solving – people often report that they know what they want to do, but can’t grasp how to do it problems with reasoning, such as mathematical laws or solving puzzlesmany of these problems aren’t specific to ms. they can be caused by other conditions, including depression and anxiety or medication. you think you have symptoms of msthe symptoms can be similar to several other conditions, so they’re not necessarily caused by ms.ms is an autoimmune condition. this means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it.in the case of ms, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. this is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body.the attacks cause the myelin sheath to become inflamed in small patches (plaques or lesions). this can be seen on amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan.these patches of inflammation can disrupt the messages travelling along the nerves. it can slow them down, jumble them, send them the wrong way, or stop them from getting through completely. this disruption leads to the symptoms and signs of ms.when the inflammation goes away, it can leave behind scarring of the myelin sheath (sclerosis). these attacks, particularly if frequent and repeated, can lead to permanent damage.exactly why someone develops multiple sclerosis (ms) isn’t known. it’s not caused by anything you’ve done and it’s not clear if you can prevent it.it’s likely to be partly caused by genes you inherit from your parents and partly by outside factors that may trigger the condition.some of the factors that might cause ms include:ms isn’t directly inherited, but if you’re related to someone with the condition you’re more likely to develop it. the chance of a sibling or child of someone with ms also developing it is around 2-3%.ms is more common in countries far from the equator. this could mean that a lack of sunlight and low vitamin d levels may play a role in the condition. it’s not clear whether vitamin d supplements can help prevent ms.people who smoke are about twice as likely to develop ms compared to those who don’t smoke.infections, particularly those caused by the epstein-barr virus, (responsible forglandular fever), might trigger the immune system, leading to ms in some people.more research will help us understand why ms occurs and whether it can be prevented or not.it can be hard to tell if you have multiple sclerosis (ms) because some of the symptoms are like other conditions. you may need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms first.if your gp thinks you could have ms, you should see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment.some of the tests you may need to confirm ms are: neurological examination magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan lumbar puncture blood testonce you have a diagnosis of ms, your neurologist might be able to identify which type of ms you have – either relapsing remitting ms or primary progressive ms.this will largely be based on: the pattern of your symptoms – like whether you experience periods when your symptoms get worse (relapses) then improve (remissions), or whether they get steadily worse (progress) the results of an mri scanit can take some time to find out which type of ms you have because the symptoms are so varied. it can take a few years to make an accurate diagnosis of progressive ms, as the condition usually worsens slowly. you think you’re having a relapsealthough there isn’t a cure for ms, there are medicines that can help to reduce the number and severity of relapses in some people. these are called disease-modifying therapies or disease modifying drugs.these reduce the amount of damage and scarring to the myelin sheath (layer surrounding your nerves), associated with ms relapses.these treatments reduce the chances of developing progressive symptoms of ms. they might also help to slow worsening disability in ms.disease-modifying therapies are not suitable for everyone with ms. they’re only prescribed to those with either: relapsing remitting ms secondary progressive ms who meet certain criteria, like the number of relapses they’ve had primary progressive ms who meet certain criteria like new lesions found by an mri scanpeople without relapses are less likely to benefit from the treatments and could still experience side effects from them.sometimes an infection can cause a flare up of symptoms rather than a relapse, so your nurse or gp will check for other possible causes.treatment for a relapse might involve a five-day course of steroid tablets taken at home.steroids can help speed up your recovery from a relapse. they don’t prevent further relapses or stop ms getting worse over time.steroids are only given for a short period of time to avoid possiblesteroid side effects. the side effects could include infection, mood disturbance, stomach ulceration,osteoporosis (weak bones), weight gain anddiabetes.not using steroids more than three times a year (if possible) will help to reduce the risk of side effects.there are different treatments available for ms symptoms.your healthcare professional should give you advice about ways to manage fatigue. this might include exercise, keeping healthy sleep patterns and energy-saving techniques. your healthcare professional might suggest avoiding medications that can worsen fatigue.specialist fatigue management courses or therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt), might also help.ms-related visual problems will often improve on their own, usually within a few weeks. if your symptoms are particularly severe, your healthcare professional might prescribe steroids.if you have problems with involuntary eye movements, medication like gabapentin can sometimes help. some people with double vision need help from ophthalmologists (eye specialists).physiotherapy can help improve muscle spasms and stiffness.techniques such as stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted.if your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles. this will usually be either baclofen, gabapentin or tizanidine.these medicines all have side effects. you might experience dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea. discuss which of these would be best for you with your specialist ms nurse.mobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity. muscle weakness, or problems with balance or dizziness can also cause mobility problems.if you have problems with mobility, your healthcare professional might suggest: an exercise programme supervised by a physiotherapist special exercises called vestibular rehabilitation, if you have problems with balance medication for dizziness or tremors mobility aids, such as a walking stick, or a wheelchair home adaptations such as stair lifts or railingsanoccupational therapistcan carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations.living with ms can cause stresses and strains to the muscles and joints in your body.a physiotherapist might be able to help with this pain by suggesting exercises or better seating positions.if your pain is more severe, you may be prescribed painkillers. or, you might have a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens) machine that stimulates your nerves.neuropathic pain is caused by damage to your nerves and is usually sharp and stabbing. it can also occur in the form of extreme skin sensitivity, or a burning sensation.this type of pain can be treated using neuropathic painkillers.your ms healthcare professionals can assess your thinking, learning and memory problems and suggest ways to manage them.people with ms who havedepressionoranxietycan be treated with antidepressants or therapy, such as cbt.if you have emotional outbursts, such as laughing or crying for no clear reason, you should be assessed by a specialist. they may suggest treatment with an antidepressant.medication might help if you have an overactive bladder or need to pee frequently during the night.if you find it difficult to empty your bladder, advice from a continence nurse or physiotherapist can help. hand-held external stimulators can help some people to start peeing or to empty the bladder.sometimes acathetercan empty the bladder when needed. you might be taught how to do intermittent self catheterisation (isc).in rare cases, people with ms may need a long-term catheter to keep the bladder emptying safely.you might be referred to a continence adviser or urologist, for specialist treatment and advice. read more abouttreating urinary incontinence.it might be possible to treat mild to moderateconstipationby changing your diet or takinglaxatives.more severe constipation may need to be treated with suppositories, which are inserted into your bottom, or an enema. during an enema, liquid medication is rinsed through

other parts of your body difficulty holding your head up aching muscles problems with tasks like climbing stairs or washing your hairsome people can experience severe breathing and swallowing difficulties, which require immediate hospital treatment. this is called a myasthenic crisis.it’s possible for patients to experience a myasthenic crisis before they know they have myasthenia gravis. you’re experiencing severe breathing or swallowing problemsyou might need emergency hospital treatment.you should avoid activities that could become dangerous if you experience sudden weakness, like swimming alone.it can be difficult to diagnose myasthenia gravis. your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms.you might need several tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms before you can be diagnosed with myasthenia gravis.a blood test will look for a high level of antibodies (made by your immune system) which might be causing myasthenia gravis.you might be offered another blood test at a later date if your initial blood test is normal but you continue to experience worsening symptoms.you might have electromyography (an emg) to test your nerves and muscles.during electromyography, you’ll have small needles inserted into your muscles to measure their electric activity. these are usually inserted around your eyes, forehead or arms.the test will measure the signals from the nerves to the muscles. if the test detects a disruption in the signals, this might be a sign of myasthenia gravis.you might have acomputerised tomography (ct) scanto check

that can help reduce the affects of your symptoms.if your symptoms get worse following certain triggers, you should try to avoid those triggers as much as possible.triggers might include: stress tiredness infections medicines surgerytreatment might include:sometimes myasthenia gravis can be treated with pyridostigmine alone. it works by temporarily improving the nerve to muscle transmission to help muscle strength.it can reduce muscle weakness and for some people this is the only medication they need to control the condition.it’s effects do not last long and it needs to be taken periodically throughout the day to give the best results.side effects can include stomach upset, diarrhoea and drooling.you might be advised to take steroid tablets like prednisolone if pyridostigmine isn’t helping.steroid tablets work by reducing the activity of your immune system to stop it attacking the communication between your nerves and muscles.it’s likely you’ll be advised to take the tablets every other day. you’re likely to start at a low dose which will be built up quickly. this might gradually be reduced once your symptoms are under control. it’s important that you do not stop

years.surgery can reduce: the dose of steroids the need to take other immunosuppressants the chances of needing to go to hospital because of worsening symptomssurgery might not help myasthenia symptoms in someone that has a thymoma. your healthcare team might still recommend having your thymus gland removed because it can cause problems if it keeps growing.your thymectomy will usually be carried out through keyhole surgery. the thymus is removed using surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the chest.plasma exchange and ivig (intravenous immunoglobulin) can offer a quick improvement (within a few days) for people with myasthenia gravis who are particularly unwell or are having a myasthenic crisis.plasma exchange is an emergency treatment that removes antibodies from your own blood. this treatment is given in hospital and the benefits can last around 6 weeks.ivig treatment involves an injection of normal antibodies from donated blood to temporarily change the way your immune system works.the two treatments are similar and your healthcare team will decide which is the best option for you. although the benefits only last a few weeks, it can give time for the longer term treatments to take effect and help improve symptoms.you might find that, during pregnancy or after having a baby, your myasthenia gravis worsens. if you’re planning a

       " 'Neuroblastoma: Children': 'most children who have neuroblastoma are younger than 5 years old. it’s the most common solid tumour in children that occurs outside of the brain and makes up 8% of the total number of children’s cancers.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.neuroblastoma develops from the cells left behind from a baby’s development in the womb. the cells that it develops from are called neuroblasts.neuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body. the site of origin is either in 1 of the 2 adrenal glands situated in the abdomen (tummy) or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. the adrenal glands are specialised glands that are found above the right and left kidney. the adrenal glands normally release hormones to maintain blood pressure, and enable us to respond to stress. in some cases, neuroblastoma can spread to tissues beyond the original site such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver, and skin.as with most cancers, the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. it is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.the symptoms vary, depending on where your child’s neuroblastoma tumour is: if the tumour is in the abdomen, your child’s tummy may be swollen and they may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine (peeing) if the tumour affects the chest area, your child may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing if the tumour occurs in the neck, it’s often visible as a lump and occasionally affects breathing and swallowing occasionally, there are deposits of neuroblastoma in the skin that appear as small, blue-coloured lumps if the tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children may have weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily – if your child is not yet walking, you may notice reduced leg movements; they may also have constipation or difficulty passing urine (peeing) your child may be found to have high blood pressure very rarely, children may have jerky eye and muscle movements, and general unsteadiness associated with the neuroblastomathere are often symptoms of tiredness, being pale, loss of appetite, weight loss, bone pain and generalised discomfort.a variety of tests and investigations will be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. these include a biopsy of the tumour, blood and bone marrow tests, x-rays, ct or mri scans, and a special nuclear medicine scan called an mibg scan. these tests are carried out to confirm the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, and to find the exact position of the original site of neuroblastoma within the body and to see whether it has spread. this process is known as staging.a specific type of urine test will also be done. nearly all children with neuroblastoma (9 out of 10) will have substances called vanillylmandelic acid (vma), or homovanillic acid (hva), in their urine. measuring the vma and hva in the urine can help to confirm the diagnosis. your child will also have their vma and hva levels checked during and after treatment. the levels of these substances will fall if the treatment is working. as these chemicals are produced by the tumour cells, and can be used to measure tumour activity, they are sometimes known as tumour markers.most children will have an mibg (meta-iodo-benzyl guanidine) scan. mibg is a substance that’s taken up by neuroblastoma cells. it’s given by injection into the blood stream. attaching a small amount of radioactive iodine to the mibg enables any neuroblastoma tissue to be seen by a radiation scanner. sometimes mibg can be used as a treatment.a small sample of cells (abiopsy) is usually taken from the tumour during an operation under a general anaesthetic. these cells are then examined under a microscope. other tests collectively referred to as tumour biology, look at the chromosomes and ‘biological markers’ in the tumour cells. one of these ‘markers’ is called mycn. the presence of a certain amount of mycn in the cells (known as mycn amplification) can suggest that the neuroblastoma may be a more aggressive type. in this situation, the treatment needs to be more intensive.the ‘stage’ of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the best treatment for your child.the cancer is contained within 1 area of the body (localised) and there’s no evidence of it having spread. it can be completely removed by surgery, or there may be very small (microscopic) amounts of tumour left.the cancer is localised and has not begun to spread, but cannot be completely removed by surgery.the cancer is localised and has begun to spread into nearby lymph nodes.the cancer has spread into surrounding organs and structures, but has not spread to distant areas of the body.the cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, liver, skin or other organs.this stage of neuroblastoma is found in children under 1 year old. the cancer is localised (as in stage 1, 2a or 2b) and has begun to spread to the liver, skin or bone marrow.a newer staging system has been developed by the international neuroblastoma risk group (inrg). this system is now widely used. it looks at whether or not certain ‘image-defined risk factors’ are present in a neuroblastoma tumour before treatment. these risk factors can be detected by scans and help doctors understand the extent of the disease. your doctor can explain more about this.the tumour is localised and has not spread into important areas (vital structures) nearby. it can be removed by surgery.the tumour is localised but has ‘image-defined risk factors’ and can’t be safely removed by surgery.the tumour has spread to other parts of the body.the tumour has spread to the skin, liver and/or the bone marrow in children younger than 18 months old.if the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, this is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. if the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer.the treatment of neuroblastoma depends on the age of the child, the size and position of the tumour, the tumour biology (including the mycn status) and whether the neuroblastoma has spread.for tumours that have not spread (localised tumours), the treatment is usually surgery. if the tumour is at an early stage and there is no evidence that it has spread to the lymph nodes or any other parts of the body, an operation to remove the tumour, or as much of it as possible, will be undertaken. if the tumour is, at first, too large or in too difficult a position to remove safely, chemotherapy will be given to shrink it before surgery. a cure is usually possible for children with localised tumours. however, if a localised tumour is classed as ‘high-risk’, due to the tumour biology results, additional treatment with chemotherapy and usually radiotherapy will be needed.if the tumour has already spread by the time of diagnosis, or is indicated as being high-risk by the tumour biology result, intensivechemotherapyis needed. chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells. it’s usually given as an infusion into a vein. your child will have a semi-permanent cannula called a central venous line inserted under a general anaesthetic to minimise the distress caused by intravenous injections.your child’s specialist will discuss with you the type and amount of chemotherapy needed.if the neuroblastoma has spread to several parts of the body, or is high-risk with mycn amplification, high dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell rescue is used after the initial courses of chemotherapy. high-dose chemotherapy will wipe out any remaining neuroblastoma cells but will also wipe out the body’s bone marrow, where blood cells are made. to prevent the problems this causes, stem cells (blood cells at their earliest stages of development) are collected from your child through a drip before the chemotherapy is given. these stem cells are then frozen and stored until required. after the high-dose chemotherapy, the stem cells are given back to your child through a drip. they make their way into the bone marrow, where they grow and develop into mature blood cells over a period of 14 to 21 days.monoclonal antibodies can destroy some types of cancer cells while causing little harm to normal cells. in the uk, patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated in the (siopen) european high-risk clinical trial receive immunotherapy with a monoclonal antibody called anti-gd2 after their high dose therapy. there is good evidence from a clinical trial (research study) carried out in america, which was first reported on in 2009, that this may be a promising therapy when given alongside standard treatment for neuroblastoma. the anti gd2 is either given on its own or with cytokines. it is not yet a standard treatment for patients with neuroblastoma as it has very unpleasant side effects, the benefits need to be fully proven and the best way to administer it needs to be established. it is therefore currently only available to patients in the uk who are being treated within a clinical trial. your child’s specialist will be able to tell you much more about this treatment.external beamradiotherapymay be given if the neuroblastoma is high-risk, or has spread to several parts of the body. this uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. external beam radiotherapy is given from a machine outside the body. internal radiotherapy may sometimes be given using radioactive mibg. radioactive mibg is similar to the mibg used in an investigation to diagnose neuroblastoma, but uses higher doses of radioactivity to kill the cancer cells.children under 18 months old with neuroblastoma often have ‘low-risk’ tumours, and as long as there is no mycn amplification, their outlook is excellent. most children in this age group are cured.children with stage 4s disease almost always get better with very little treatment or none at all. these tumours either regress spontaneously or after chemotherapy, which is only given if there are symptoms from the tumour. they disappear completely or develop into a non-cancerous (benign) tumour, called a ganglioneuroma. many of these children, after their initial diagnostic tests and staging investigations, will just need careful monitoring for some years. ganglioneuromas are usually harmless and will not cause any problems and do not need any treatment.chemotherapy often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. the side effects will depend upon the actual drugs being given. immediate side effects can include: feeling sick (nausea) and being sick

these include a change in the way the heart and kidneys work, hearing problems, fertility problems, a possible reduction in bone growth if radiotherapy has been given, and a slightly increased risk of developing another cancer in later life. your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. specialist doctors organise many trials for children’s cancer. children in the uk with neuroblastoma can take part in national and european studies. the european research group is called siopen. if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. written information is provided to help explain things. taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.follow-up after treatment usually involves regular visits to the hospital outpatients department, with scans and urine tests as necessary. for children who have had chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, more specialised tests may also be carried our. for example, hearing tests, kidney and heart function tests, and checking hormone levels. these will be repeated until your child is grown up. if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows their situation in detail.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",

       " 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)': 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. it’s usually seen in people who are overweight or obese.a healthy liver should contain little or no fat. it’s estimated that up to 1 in every 3 people in the uk has early stages of nafld where there are small amounts of fat in their liver.early-stage nafld doesn’t usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, includingcirrhosis, if it gets worse. having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of problems such asdiabetes,heart attacksandstrokes.if detected and managed at an early stage, it’s possible to stop nafld getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver.nafld develops in 4 main stages.most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. in small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed.the main stages of nafld are:it can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. it’s important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse.you’re at an increased risk of nafld if you:however, nafld has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children.although it’s very similar toalcohol-related liver disease (arld), nafld isn’t caused by drinking too much alcohol.there aren’t usually any symptoms of nafld in the early stages. you probably won’t know you have it unless it’s diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.occasionally, people with nash or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience: a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs) fatigue (extreme tiredness) unexplained weight loss weaknessif cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy.read more about thesymptoms of cirrhosis.nafld is often diagnosed after ablood testcalled a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. however, blood tests don’t always pick up nafld.the condition may also be spotted during anultrasound scanof your tummy. this is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body.if you’re diagnosed with nafld, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. this may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (fibroscan). some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue (biopsy) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory.most people with nafld won’t develop any serious problems, but if you’re diagnosed with the condition it’s a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse.there’s currently no specific medication for nafld, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help and treatment may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications.you may be advised to have regular appointments with your doctor to check your liver function and look for signs of any new problems.adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing nafld. the following can all help.lose weight– you should aim for abmiof 18.5-24.9. losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve nash if you have it.eat a healthy diet– try to have a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. eating smaller portions of food can help too.exercise regularly– aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. all types of exercise can help improve nafld, even if you don’t lose weight.stop smoking– if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes.nafld isn’t caused by alcohol, but drinking may make the condition worse. it’s therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. read sometips on cutting down on alcohol.there isn’t currently any medication that can treat nafld, but various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition.for example, your doctor may recommend medication totreat high blood pressure,treat high cholesterol,treat type 2 diabetesand/ortreat obesity.if you develop severe cirrhosis and your liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant.for adults, the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 145 days for transplants from recently deceased donors.alternatively, it may be possible to have a transplant using a section of liver removed from a living donor. as the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor’s liver are able to regrow to a normal size.read more aboutliver transplants.',\n",

system is part of your immune system. clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.in non-hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). the affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.the most common symptom of non-hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.read

where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively low-grade or indolent non-hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many yearsthe outlook for non-hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type, grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person’s age.low-grade tumours don’t necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. high-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.the main treatments used for non-hodgkin

nodes, also known as lymph glands, are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. they contain white blood cells that help to fight against infection.the swelling is caused by a certain type of white blood cell, known as lymphocytes, collecting in the lymph node.however, it’s highly unlikely you have non-hodgkin lymphoma if you haveswollen lymph nodes, as these glands often swell as a response to infection.some people with non-hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. these can include: night sweats unintentional weight loss a high temperature (fever) a persistentcoughor feeling ofbreathlessness persistent itching of the skin all over the bodyother symptoms depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. for example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may haveabdominal painorindigestion.a few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they’re diagnosed. this may lead to: persistent tiredness or fatigue an increased risk of infections excessive bleeding – such asnosebleeds, heavy periods and spots of blood under the skinspeak to your gp if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.while the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by non-hodgkin lymphoma, it’s best to get them checked out.non-hodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the dna of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. the exact reason why this happens isn’t known.dna gives cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. the mutation in the dna changes these instructions, so the cells keep growing. this causes them to multiply uncontrollably.the abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. over time, it’s possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your: bone marrow spleen liver skin lungshowever, in some cases, non-hodgkin lymphoma first develops in an organ or somewhere else outside the lymphatic system (the network of lymph vessels and glands found throughout the body).while the cause of the initial mutation that triggers non-hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. these include: having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such ashiv having medical treatment that weakens your immune system – for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after an organ transplant having an autoimmune condition (a condition caused by problems with the immune system), such asrheumatoid arthritis,lupusorsjogren’s syndrome being previously exposed to the epstein-barr virus – a

out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected non-hodgkin lymphoma, read thenice 2015 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral.if you’re referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-hodgkin lymphoma.abiopsyinvolves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory.biopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under alocal anaesthetic(where the area is numbed). in some cases, the affected lymph node isn’t easily accessible and ageneral anaestheticmay be required (where you’re asleep).a pathologist (an expert in the study of diseased tissue) will then check the tissue sample for the presence of cancerous cells. if they find cancerous cells, they can also identify exactly which type of non-hodgkin lymphoma you have, which is an important factor in planning your treatment.there are more than 30 types of non-hodgkin lymphoma, including: diffuse large b-cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma extranodal marginal zone b-cell (malt) mantle cell lymphoma burkitt lymphoma mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma nodal marginal zone b-cell

website has more detailed information on thedifferent types of non-hodgkin lymphoma.if a biopsy confirms a diagnosis of non-hodgkin lymphoma, further testing will be required to check how far the lymphoma has spread. this allows a doctor to diagnose the stage of your lymphoma.further tests may include: blood tests– samples of blood will be taken throughout your diagnosis and treatment to check your general health, the levels of red and white cells and platelets in your blood, and how well organs such as your liver and kidney are working bone marrow sample – another biopsy may be carried out to see if the lymphoma has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic chestx-ray– this can check whether the cancer has spread to your chest or lungs computerised tomography (ct) scan– this scan takes a series of x-rays that build up a 3d picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of the cancer magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– this scan uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body to check the spread of the cancer positron emission tomography (pet) scan– this scan measures the activity of cells in different parts of the body and can check the spread of the cancer and the impact of treatment; it’s usually taken at the same time as a ct scan to show precisely how the tissues of different sites of the body are working lumbar puncture – using a thin needle, a sample of spinal fluid is taken and examined to see if it contains any lymphoma cellswhen the testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. ‘staging’ means scoring the cancer by how far it’s spread.the main stages of non-hodgkin lymphoma are. stage 1 – the cancer is limited to 1 group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs) stage 2 – 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below the diaphragm stage 3 – the cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm stage 4 – the lymphoma has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrowhealth professionals also add the letter ‘a’ or ‘b’ to your stage to indicate whether or not you have certain symptoms.‘a’ is put after your stage if you have no additional symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes. ‘b’ is put after your stage if you have additional symptoms of weight loss, fever or night sweats.in some cases, health professionals also use additional letters to indicate where the cancer first developed. for example, ‘e’ (extranodal) means the cancer developed outside the lymphatic system.testing can also help health professionals decide the ‘grade’ of the cancer. there are two main grades of non-hodgkin lymphoma: low-grade or indolent non-hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years high-grade or aggressive non-hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops quickly and aggressivelylow-grade tumours don’t necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. high-grade lymphomas need to be treated immediately, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.in some cases, low-grade lymphomas can develop into high-grade lymphomas over time.read more abouttreating non-hodgkin lymphoma.non-hodgkin lymphoma is usually treated with cancer-killing medication or radiotherapy, although some people may not need treatment straight away.in a few cases, if the initial cancer is very small and can be removed during abiopsy, no further treatment may be needed.the recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, as many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body.discussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. this is known as a multidisciplinary team (mdt).your mdt will recommend the best treatment options for you. however, you shouldn’t be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner.you’ll be invited back to see your care team for a full discussion about the risks and benefits of any treatments planned before treatment begins.you can ask your care team if a clinical trial is available to take part in.if the disease is low-grade (slow developing) and you’re well, a period of ‘watchful waiting’ is often recommended. this is because some people take many years to develop troublesome symptoms and starting treatment immediately is often felt to be unnecessary.if watchful waiting is recommended, you’ll be seen regularly for reviews and invited to come back at any stage if you feel your symptoms are getting worse.chemotherapyis a widely used treatment for non-hodgkin lymphoma, which involves using medicine to kill cancer cells. it may be used on its own, combined with biological therapy and/or combined with radiotherapy (see below).the medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on the stage of your cancer.if doctors think your cancer is curable, you’ll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy). if a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms.if there’s a risk of the cancer spreading to your brain, you may have chemotherapy injections directly into the cerebrospinal fluid around your spine.chemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn’t have to stay in hospital overnight. however, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome, and a longer hospital stay may be needed.chemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. this can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems: fatigue breathlessness increased vulnerability to infection bleeding and bruising more easilyif you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells.other possible side effects of chemotherapy include: nausea and vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite mouth ulcers tiredness skin rashes hair loss infertility, which may be temporary or permanentmost side effects should pass once your treatment has finished. tell your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments that can help.read more about theside effects of chemotherapy.if non-hodgkin lymphoma doesn’t get better with initial treatment (known as ‘refractory’ lymphoma), you may have a course of chemotherapy at a stronger dose.however, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. you’ll need a stem cell or bone marrow transplants to replace the damaged bone marrow.radiotherapyis most often used to treat early-stage non-hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in 1 part of the body.treatment is normally given in short daily sessions, monday to friday, over several weeks. you should not have to stay in hospital between appointments.radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. these can vary, depending on which part of your body is being treated. for example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss.other common side effects include: sore and red skin in the treatment area tiredness nausea and vomiting dry mouth loss of appetitemost side effects are temporary, but there’s a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area.read more about: side effects of radiotherapy complications of non-hodgkin lymphomafor some types of non-hodgkin lymphoma, you may have a type of medication called a monoclonal antibody.these medications attach themselves to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulate the immune system to attack and kill the cells. they’re often given in combination with chemotherapy to make the treatment more effective.for some types of non-hodgkin lymphoma, you may continue having monoclonal antibody treatment regularly for up to 2 years after initial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy. this can reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the future.one of the main monoclonal antibody medications used to treat non-hodgkin lymphoma is called rituximab. this medication is administered directly into your vein over the course of a few hours.side effects of rituximab can include: flu-like symptoms, such asheadaches, fever and chills tiredness nausea an itchy rashyou may be given additional medication to prevent or lessen these side effects. side effects should improve over time, as your body gets used to rituximab.as rituximab has been so successful in treating non-hodgkin lymphoma, scientists are working hard to make more monoclonal antibody treatments for lymphoma, and some of these are already at an advanced stage in clinical trials. you may be asked if you want to participate in one of these trials during your treatment.steroid medicationis commonly used in combination with chemotherapy to treat non-hodgkin lymphoma. this is because research has shown that using steroids makes the chemotherapy more effective.the steroid medication is normally given as tablets, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy. a short course of steroids, lasting no more than a few months, is usually recommended, as this limits the number of side effects you could have.common side effects of short-term steroid use include: increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain indigestion problems sleeping feeling agitatedon rare occasions, you may have to take steroids on a long-term basis. side effects of long-term steroid use include weight gain and swelling in your hands, feet and eyelids.the side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes.after your course of treatment ends, you may have a repeat scan to see how well the treatment has worked. following this, you’ll need regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning (known as a ‘relapse’).these appointments will start off being every few weeks or months, but become less frequent over time.read further information: cancer research uk: treating non-hodgkin lymphoma cancer research uk: living with non-hodgkin lymphoma

weakened immune system is a common complication of non-hodgkin lymphoma and it can become more severe while you’re being treated.however, your immune system will usually recover in the months and years after treatment.if you have a weak immune system, you’re more vulnerable to infections, and there’s an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. in some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses ofantibioticsto prevent infections occurring.it’s also important to report any symptoms of an infection to your gp or care team immediately, because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent serious complications. this is particularly important in the first few months after treatment.symptoms of infection include: a high temperature (fever) headache aching muscles diarrhoea tiredness a painful blistering rashyou should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up to date.however, it’s important to speak to your gp or care team about this because it may not be safe for you to have ‘live’ vaccines (vaccines containing a weakened form of the virus or organism being vaccinated against) until several months after your treatment finishes.examples of ‘live’ vaccines include the: shinglesvaccine bcg vaccine (against tuberculosis) mmr vaccine (againstmeasles,mumpsand rubella)chemotherapyandradiotherapyfor non-hodgkin lymphoma can causeinfertility. this is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent.your care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and let you know your options.in some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment, so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.having treatment for non-hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of developing another type of cancer in the future. this is known as a ‘second cancer’.the risk of getting cancer is particularly increased after cancer treatment because chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage healthy cells, as well as cancer cells. this damage can then cause the affected cells to become cancerous many years after treatment.you can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.you should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your gp at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you’re invited to.treatment for non-hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of getting certain conditions at a younger age than normal, such as: heart disease lung disease kidney disease thyroid disease diabetes cataractshaving a cancer diagnosis can also increase your risk ofdepression.you should report unexpected symptoms, such as

your child’s individual situation.the lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body’s natural defence against infection and disease. this is a complex system made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes throughout the body. the lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels.lymph nodes are also known as lymph glands, and the ones that you’re most likely to notice are those in the neck, armpit and groin.the number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. in some parts there are very few, whereas under your arm there may be 20 to 50 nodes.cancers that start in the lymphatic system are called lymphomas. there are 2 main types of lymphoma:although they’re both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment.there are 2 main types of nhl. b-cell nhl usually involves the lymph nodes in the abdomen and intestines, but may involve nodes in the head and neck. t-cell nhl usually affects lymph nodes in the chest.occasionally, nhl can develop in unusual places outside the lymph nodes. this is called extranodal lymphoma.we don’t know what causes nhl but there is research going on all the time to try to find out. it’s important to remember that nothing you have done has caused the cancer.the first sign of nhl is usually a lump somewhere in the body, which is caused by swollen lymph nodes. this can cause different symptoms, depending on where the swollen lymph nodes are. if glands in the abdomen are affected, this may cause a feeling of being full after meals and some stomach pain. other symptoms of nhl include a high temperature (fever), tiredness, weight loss, and loss of appetite. in a few children, lymphoma cells may be found in the bone marrow or in the fluid around the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid).a variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose nhl. part, or all, of a swollen lymph gland, may be removed so that the cells can be examined in the laboratory (biopsy). this involves a small operation that is usually done under a general anaesthetic. tests such as x-rays, ultrasound scans, mri scans, ct scans, blood tests and bone marrow samples may be carried out to find out the extent of the disease. this is known as staging.any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) has more information about what the tests and scans involve.the stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. the type of treatment your child receives depends on the stage of the disease.one group of lymph nodes is affected, or there’s a single extranodal tumour.two or more groups of nodes are affected, or there is a single extranodal tumour that has spread to nearby lymph nodes, or there are two single extranodal tumours, but only on one side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs, which plays a large part in our breathing).there’s lymphoma on both sides of the diaphragm (either in two or more groups of nodes) or there are two single extranodal tumours or the lymphoma is affecting the chest.the lymphoma has spread beyond the lymph nodes to other organs of the body such as the bone marrow or nervous system.treatment for nhl has a very good success rate and many people are cured.chemotherapyis the most important treatment for children with nhl. chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.it’s common for a combination of drugs to be used and treatment may last a number of months or years. the treatment will be planned according to your child’s particular type of nhl and the stage of the disease. b-cell nhl is treated with 4 to 8 courses of intensive chemotherapy. t-cell nhl is treated for about 2 years. your child’s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you.nhl can sometimes affect the brain and spinal cord. to stop this, chemotherapy may be injected directly into the fluid around the spinal cord. this is called intrathecal chemotherapy.very rarely,radiotherapyis also necessary. radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.high-dose chemotherapy with a bone marrow transplant is sometimes used (again very rarely) if the nhl comes back (recurs) after initial treatment.treatment for nhl can cause different side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. any possible side effects will depend on the part of the body that’s being treated and what treatment is being used. some children have just a few side effects, while others experience more.side effects can include: feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting a sore mouth temporaryhair loss a low blood count leading to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding (sometimes blood and/or platelet transfusions are needed) tiredness diarrhoeamonths or years later some children will develop late side effects from the treatment they have had. these include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart, lungs and kidneys work, and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.after treatment with chemotherapy, some children – particularly boys – may become infertile. older boys, and their parents, should be aware of the option of sperm banking. in this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years.your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects and will keep a close eye on possible long-term side effects in follow-up clinics.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. cancer research trials are carried outto try to find new and better treatments for cancer. clinical trials mean there are now better results for curing children’s cancers compared with just a few years ago. your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. written information is provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.once treatment has finished, the doctors will monitor your child closely with regular appointments in the hospital outpatient department.if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",

       " 'Obesity': 'the term ‘obese’ describes a person who’s very overweight, with a lot of body fat.it’s a common problem in the uk that’s estimated to affect around one in every four adults and around one in every five children aged 10 to 11.there are many ways in which a person’s health in relation to their weight can be classified, but the most widely used method is body mass index (bmi).bmi is a measure of whether you’re a healthy weight for your height. you can use thebmi healthy weight chartto work out your score.for most adults, a bmi of: 18.5 to 24.9 means you’re a healthy weight 25 to 29.9 means you’re overweight 30 to 39.9 means you’re obese 40 or above means you’re severely obesebmi isn’t used to definitively diagnose obesity, because people who are very muscular sometimes have a high bmi without excess fat. but for most people, bmi is a useful indication of whether they’re a healthy weight, overweight or obese.a better measure of excess fat is waist circumference, which can be used as an additional measure in people who are overweight (with a bmi of 25 to 29.9) or moderately obese (with a bmi of 30 to 34.9).generally, men with a waist circumference of 94cm (37in) or more and women with a waist circumference of 80cm (about 31.5in) or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.read more aboutdiagnosing obesityit’s very important to take steps to tackle obesity because, as well as causing obvious physical changes, it can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as: type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease some types of cancer, such asbreast cancerandbowel cancer strokeobesity can also affect your quality of life and lead to psychological problems, such asdepressionand low self-esteem (see below for more information about the health problems associated with obesity).obesity is generally caused by consuming more calories – particularly those in fatty and sugary foods – than you burn off through physical activity. the excess energy is stored by the body as fat.obesity is an increasingly common problem because for many people modern living involves eating excessive amounts of cheap, high-calorie food and spending a lot of time sitting down, at desks, on sofas or in cars.there are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as anunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), although these type of conditions don’t usually cause weight problems if they’re effectively controlled with medication.read more about thecauses of obesitythe best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet andexercise regularly. to do this you should: eat a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your gp or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian) join a local weight loss group take up activities such as fastwalking, jogging,swimmingor tennis for 150 to 300 minutes (two-and-a-half to five hours) a week eat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeatyou may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare professional to help change the way you think about food and eating.if lifestyle changes alone don’t help you lose weight, a medication called orlistat may be recommended. if taken correctly, this medication works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. your gp will know whether orlistat is suitable for you.in rare cases, weight loss surgery may be recommended.read more abouthow obesity is treatedobesity can cause a number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions.day-to-day problems related to obesity include: breathlessness increased sweating snoring difficulty doing physical activity often feeling very tired joint and back pain low confidence and self-esteem feeling isolatedthe psychological problems associated with being obese can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression.being obese can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious health conditions, including: type 2 diabetes – a condition that causes a person’s blood sugar level to become too high high blood pressure high cholesteroland atherosclerosis (where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and stroke asthma metabolic syndrome – a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity several types ofcancer, including bowel cancer, breast cancer andwomb cancer gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord)– where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the oesophagus (gullet) gallstones– small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder reduced fertility osteoarthritis– a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints sleep apnoea– a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease liver diseaseandkidney disease pregnancy complications, such asgestational diabetesor pre-eclampsia (when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy)obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of 3 to 10 years, depending on how severe it is. it’s estimated that obesity and being overweight contribute to at least 1 in every 13 deaths in europe.there’s no “quick fix” for obesity. weight loss programmes take time and commitment, and work best when fully completed. the healthcare professionals involved with your care should provide encouragement and advice about how to maintain the weight loss achieved.regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals and involving your friends and family with your attempts to lose weight can also help.remember that even losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little.if you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but don’t burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat.the energy value of food is measured in units called calories. the average physically active man needs about 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, and the average physically active woman needs about 2,000 calories a day.this amount of calories may sound high, but it can be easy to reach if you eat certain types of food. for example, eating a large takeaway hamburger, fries and a milkshake can total 1,500 calories – and that’s just one meal.another problem is that many people aren’t physically active, so lots of the calories they consume end up being stored in their body as fat.obesity doesn’t happen overnight. it develops gradually over time, as a result of poor diet and lifestyle choices, such as: eating large amounts of processed or fast food – that’s high in fat and sugar drinking too muchalcohol– alcohol contains a lot of calories, and people who drink heavily are often overweight eating out a lot – you may be tempted to also have a starter or dessert in a restaurant, and the food can be higher in fat and sugar eating larger portions than you need – you may be encouraged to eat too much if your friends or relatives are also eating large portions drinking too many sugary drinks – including soft drinks and fruit juice comfort eating – if you have low self-esteem or feel depressed, you may eat to make yourself feel betterunhealthy eating habits tend to run in families. you may learn bad eating habits from your parents when you’re young and continue them into adulthood.read more abouteating welllack of physical activity is another important factor related to obesity. many people have jobs that involve sitting at a desk for most of the day. they also rely on their cars, rather thanwalkingorcycling.for relaxation, many people tend to watch tv, browse the internet or play computer games, and rarely takeregular exercise.if you’re not active enough, you don’t use the energy provided by the food you eat, and the extra energy you consume is stored by the body as fat.the department of health recommends that adults do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week. this doesn’t need to be done all in one go, but can be broken down into smaller periods. for example, you could exercise for 30 minutes a day for five days a week.if you’re obese and trying tolose weight, you may need to do more exercise than this. it may help to start off slowly and gradually increase the amount of exercise you do each week.read more about thephysical activity guidelines for adultssome people claim there’s no point trying to lose weight because “it runs in my family” or “it’s in my genes”.while there are some rare genetic conditions that can cause obesity, such as prader-willi syndrome, there’s no reason why most people can’t lose weight.it may be true that certain genetic traits inherited from your parents – such as having a large appetite – may make losing weight more difficult, but it certainly doesn’t make it impossible.in many cases, obesity is more to do with environmental factors, such as poor eating habits learned during childhood.in some cases, underlying medical conditions may contribute to weight gain. these include: anunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)– where your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones cushing’s syndrome – a rare disorder that causes the over-production of steroid hormoneshowever, if conditions such as these are properly diagnosed and treated, they should pose less of a barrier to weight loss.certain medicines, including somecorticosteroids, medications forepilepsyanddiabetes, and some medications used to treat mental illness – includingantidepressantsand medicines forschizophrenia– can contribute to weight gain.weight gain can sometimes be a side effect ofstopping smokingbody mass index (bmi) is widely used as a simple and reliable way of finding out whether a person is a healthy weight for their height.for most adults, having a bmi of 18.5 to 24.9 means you’re considered to be a healthy weight. a person with a bmi of 25 to 29.9 is considered to be overweight, and someone with a bmi over 30 is considered to be obese.while bmi is a useful measurement for most people, it’s not accurate for everyone.for example, the normal bmi scores may not be accurate if you’re very muscular because muscle can add extra pounds, resulting in a high bmi when you’re not an unhealthy weight. in such cases, your waist circumference may be a better guide (see below).what’s considered a healthy bmi is also influenced by your ethnic background. the scores mentioned above generally apply to people with a white caucasian background. if you have an ethnic minority background, the threshold for being considered overweight or obese may be lower.bmi shouldn’t be used to work out whether a child is a healthy weight, because their bodies are still developing. speak to your gp if you want to find out whether your child is overweight.if you’re overweight or obese, visit your gp for advice aboutlosing weight safelyand to find out whether you have an increased risk of health problems.your gp may ask about: your lifestyle – particularly your diet and how much physical activity you do; they’ll also ask you whether you smoke and how much alcohol you drink any possible underlying causes for your obesity – for example, if you’re taking medication or have a medical condition that may contribute to weight gain how you feel about being overweight – for example, if it makes you feel depressed how motivated you are to lose weight your family history – as obesity and other health conditions, such asdiabetes, are often more common in familiesas well as calculating your bmi, your gp may also carry out tests to determine whether you’re at increased risk of developing health complications because of your weight.these could include measuring your: blood pressure glucose (sugar) and cholesterol levels in a blood sample waist circumference (the distance around your waist)people with very large waists – generally, 94cm (37in) or more in men and 80cm (about 31.5in) or more in women – are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.your gp may also take your ethnicity into account because it can affect your risk of developing certain conditions. for example, some people of asian, african or afro-caribbean ethnicity may be at increased risk ofhigh blood pressure (hypertension). healthy waist measurements can also be different for people from different ethnic backgrounds.after your assessment, you’ll be offered an appointment to discuss the results in more detail, ask any questions that you have, and fully explore the treatment options available to you.if you’re obese, speak to your gp for advice about losing weight safely.your gp can advise you about losing weight safely by eating ahealthy, balanced dietand regularphysical activity.they can also let you know about other useful services, such as: local weight loss groups – these could be provided by your local authority, the nhs, or commercial services you may have to pay for exercise on prescription – where you’re referred to a local active health team for a number of sessions under the supervision of a qualified trainerif you have underlying problems associated with obesity, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos),high blood pressure,diabetesorobstructive sleep apnoea, your gp may recommend further tests or specific treatment. in some cases, they may refer you to a specialist.read more abouthow your gp can help you lose weightthere’s no single rule that applies to everyone, but to lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate of 0.5 to 1kg (1lb to 2lbs) a week, most people are advised to reduce their energy intake by 600 calories a day.for most men, this will mean consuming no more than 1,900 calories a day, and for most women, no more than 1,400 calories a day.the best way to achieve this is to swap unhealthy and high-energy food choices – such as fast food, processed food and sugary drinks (including alcohol) – for healthier choices.a healthy diet should consist of: plenty of fruit and vegetables plenty of potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy foods (ideally you should choose wholegrain varieties) some milk and dairy foods some meat, fish, aggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of protein just small amounts of food and drinks that are high in fat and suagrtry to avoid foods containing high levels of salt because they can raise your blood pressure, which can be dangerous for people who are already obese.you’ll also need to check calorie information for each type of food and drink you consume to make sure you don’t go over your daily limit.some restaurants, cafés and fast food outlets provide calorie information per portion, although providing this information isn’t compulsory. be careful when eating out because some foods can quickly take you over the limit, such as burgers, fried chicken, and some curries or chinese dishes.avoid fad diets that recommend unsafe practices, such as fasting (going without food for long periods of time) or cutting out entire food groups. these types of diets don’t work, can make you feel ill, and aren’t sustainable because they don’t teach you long-term healthy eating habits.this isn’t to say that all commercial diet programmes are unsafe. many are based on sound medical and scientific principles and can work well for some people.a responsible diet programme should: educate you about issues such as portion size, making behavioural changes and healthy eating not be overly restrictive in terms of the type of foods you can eat be based on achieving gradual, sustainable weight loss rather than short-term rapid weight loss, which is unlikely to lasta very low calorie diet (vlcd) is where you consume less than 800 calories a day.these diets can lead to rapid weight loss, but they aren’t a suitable or safe method for everyone, and they aren’t routinely recommended for managing obesity.vlcds are usually only recommended if you have an obesity-related complication that would benefit from rapid weight loss.vlcds shouldn’t usually be followed for longer than 12 weeks at a time, and they should only be used under the supervision of a suitably qualified healthcare professional.speak to your gp first if you’re considering this type of diet.reducing the amount of calories in your diet will help you lose weight, but maintaining a healthy weight requires physical activity to burn energy.as well as helping you maintain a healthy weight, physical activity also has wider health benefits. for example, it can help prevent and manage more than 20 conditions, such as reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes by 40%.the chief medical officers recommend that adults should do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of at least moderate-intensity activity a week – for example, five 30-minute bouts a week. something is better than nothing, and doing just 10 minutes of exercise at a time is beneficial.moderate-intensity activity is any activity that increases your heart and breathing rate, such as: briskwalking cycling recreationalswimming dancingalternatively, you could do 75 minutes (one hour, fifteen minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity.during vigorous activity, breathing is very hard, your heart beats rapidly and you may be unable to hold a conversation. examples include: running most competitive sports circuit trainingyou should also do strength and balance training two days a week. this could be in the form of a gym workout, carrying shopping bags, or doing an activity such astai chi. it’s also critical that you break up sitting (sedentary) time by getting up and moving around.read more aboutstrength and balance exercises.your gp, weight loss adviser or staff at your local sports centre can help you create a plan suited to your own personal needs and circumstances, with achievable and motivating goals. start small and build up gradually.it’s also important to find activities you enjoy and want to keep doing. activities with a social element or exercising with friends or family can help keep you motivated. make a start today – it’s never too late.read more about thephysical activity guidelines for adultsand thephysical activity guidelines for older adults.evidence has shown that weight loss can be more successful if it involves other strategies, alongside diet and lifestyle changes. this could include things like: setting realistic weight loss goals – if you’re obese, losing just 3% of your original body weight can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications eating more slowly and being mindful of what and when you’re eating – for example, not being distracted by watching tv avoiding situations where you know you may be tempted to overeat involving your family and friends with your weight loss efforts –they can help to motivate you monitoring your progress – for example, weigh yourself regularly and make a note of your weight in a diarygetting psychological support from a trained healthcare professional may also help you change the way you think about food and eating. techniques such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) can be useful.it’s important to remember that as you lose weight your body needs less food (calories), so after a few months, weight loss slows and levels off, even if you continue to follow a diet.if you go back to your previous calorie intake once you’ve lost weight, it’s very likely you’ll put the weight back on. increasing physical activity to up to 60 minutes a day and continuing to watch what you eat may help you keep the weight off.many different types of anti-obesity medicines have been tested in clinical trials, but only one has proved to be safe and effective: orlistat.you can only use orlistat if a doctor or pharmacist thinks it’s the right medicine for you. in most cases, orlistat is only available on prescription. only one product (alli) is available over the counter directly from pharmacies, under the supervision of a pharmacist.orlistat works by preventing around a third of the fat from the food you eat being absorbed. the undigested fat isn’t absorbed into your body and is passed out with your faeces (stools). this will help you avoid gaining weight, but won’t necessarily cause you to lose weight.a balanced diet and exercise programme should be started before beginning treatment with orlistat, and you should continue this programme during treatment and after you stop taking orlistat.orlistat will usually only be recommended if you’ve made a significant effort to lose weight through diet, exercise or changing your lifestyle.even then, orlistat is only prescribed if you have a: body mass index (bmi) of 28 or more, and other weight-related conditions, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes bmi of 30 or morebefore prescribing orlistat, your doctor will discuss the benefits and potential limitations with you, including any potential side effects (see below).treatment with orlistat must be combined with a balanced low-fat diet and other weight loss strategies, such as doing more exercise. it’s important that the diet is nutritionally balanced over three main meals.if you’re prescribed orlistat, you’ll also be offered advice and support about diet, exercise and making lifestyle changes.orlistat isn’t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women.one orlistat capsule is taken with water immediately before, during or up to one hour after, each main meal (up to a maximum of three capsules a day).if you miss a meal, or the meal doesn’t contain any fat, you shouldn’t need to take the orlistat capsule. your doctor should explain this to you, or you can check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.treatment with orlistat should only continue beyond three months if you’ve lost 5% of your body weight. it usually starts to affect how you digest fat within one to two days.if you haven’t lost weight after taking orlistat for three months, it’s unlikely to be an effective treatment for you. consult your doctor or pharmacist, as it may be necessary to stop your treatment.see your gp before starting treatment with orlistat if you have another serious health condition, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease, which you’re taking medication for. it may be necessary to change the dose of your medicine.if you have type 2 diabetes, it may take you longer to lose weight using orlistat, so your target weight loss after three months may therefore be slightly lower.if orlistat has helped you lose weight after three months, your prescription may be continued for up to a year. after that, your gp will carry out a review and decide whether you should continue taking it.common side effects of orlistat include: fatty or oily stools needing the toilet urgently passing stools more frequently an oily discharge from your rectum (you may have oily spots on your underwear) flatulence (wind) stomach pain headaches upper respiratory tract infections, such as acoldthese side effects are much less likely to occur if you stick to a low-fat diet.women taking theoral contraceptive pillshould use an additional method ofcontraception, such as acondom, if they experience severediarrhoeawhile taking orlistat. this is because the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed by your body if you have diarrhoea, so it may not be effective.weight loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is sometimes used to treat people who are severely obese.bariatric surgery is usually only available on the nhs to treat people with severe obesity who fulfil all of the following criteria: they have a bmi of 40 or more, or between 35 and 40 and another serious

       " 'Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)': 'obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) is a mental health condition. it causes a person to have obsessive thoughts and carry out compulsive activity.this can be distressing and can have a big impact on your life. treatment can help you keep it under control.ocd affects people differently. it usually causes a particular pattern of thought and behaviour.this pattern has 4 main steps:almost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point in their life. this might be a concern that you’ve forgotten to lock the door of the house or that you might get a disease from touching other people. it could be sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images.most people are able to put these types of thoughts and concerns into context. they can then carry on with their day-to-day life. they do not repeatedly think about worries they know have little substance.if you have persistent and unwanted thoughts that dominates your thinking, you may have developed an obsession.some common obsessions that affect people with ocd include:compulsions happen as a way of trying to reduce or prevent the harm of the obsessive thought. however, this behaviour is either excessive or not connected at all.for example, a person who fears becoming contaminated with dirt and germs may wash their hands repeatedly. or someone with a fear of causing harm to their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to try to ‘neutralise’ the thought of harm. this type of compulsive behaviour is particularly common in children with ocd.most people with ocd realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational. they might know it makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on their compulsion.not all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people.some people with ocd may also have or develop other mental health problems, including: depression eating disorders generalised anxiety disorder a hoarding disorderpeople with ocd and severe depression might also havesuicidalfeelings.the exact cause of ocd is not known. there are some factors that could make a person more likely to have ocd.these factors might include: genetics life events personality traits chemical differences in the braindiagnosis and treatment can help to reduce the impact of ocd on your day-to-day life. you think you might have ocdmany people do not tell their gp about their symptoms because they feel ashamed or embarrassed. they may also try to disguise their symptoms from family and friends.if you have ocd, you should not feel ashamed or embarrassed. likediabetesorasthma, it’s a long-term health condition, and it’s not your fault you have it.your gp will probably ask you a series of questions to see if it’s likely you have ocd.if the results of the initial screening questions suggest you have ocd, the severity of your symptoms will be assessed. either your gp or a mental health professional will carry out the assessment.it’s important you’re open and honest. accurate and truthful responses will ensure you receive the most appropriate treatment.if you think someone you know may have ocd, it’s a good idea to: talk to them carefully about your concerns suggest they speak to their gptreatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) depends on the how much the condition is affecting your daily life.the 2 main treatments are: cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) medicationif your ocd has a severe impact on your daily life, you’ll usually be referred to a specialist mental health service. here you’ll likely receive a combination of intensive cbt and a course of antidepressants calledselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris).children with ocd are usually referred to a healthcare professional with experience of treating ocd in children.it can take several months before a treatment has a noticeable effect.you might be offered specialist treatment if you’ve tried other treatments and your ocd is still not under control.most people improve after receiving treatment.ocd actionhave online support groups where you can connect with other people with similar experiences. obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) self-help guide selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) depression anxiety disorders in children ocd-uk choice and medication: obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) ocd action',\n",
       " 'Obstructive sleep apnoea': 'obstructive sleep apnoea (osa) is a relatively common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing.this may lead to regularly interrupted sleep, which can have a big impact on quality of life and increases the risk of developing certain conditions.there are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of osa: apnoea – where the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a total blockage of the airway; it’s called an apnoea when the airflow is blocked for 10 seconds or more hypopnoea – a partial blockage of the airway that results in an airflow reduction of greater than 50% for 10 seconds or morepeople with osa may experience repeated episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea throughout the night. these events may occur around once every one or two minutes in severe cases.as many people with osa experience episodes of both apnoea and hypopnoea, doctors sometimes refer to the condition as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome, or osahs.the term ‘obstructive’ distinguishes osa from rarer forms of sleep apnoea, such as central sleep apnoea, which is caused by the brain not sending signals to the breathing muscles during sleep.the symptoms of osa are often first spotted by a partner, friend or family member who notices problems while you sleep.signs of osa in someone sleeping can include: loud snoring noisy and laboured breathing repeated short periods where breathing is interrupted by gasping or snortingsome people with osa may also experience night sweats and may wake up frequently during the night to urinate.during an episode, the lack of oxygen triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep – either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness – so your airway reopens and you can breathe normally.these repeated sleep interruptions can make you feel very tired during the day. you’ll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you may be unaware you have a problem.see your gp if you think you might have osa.they can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and can arrange for an assessment of your sleep to be carried out through a local sleep centre.as someone with osa may not notice they have the condition, it often goes undiagnosed.read more aboutdiagnosing osa.it’s normal for the muscles and soft tissues in the throat to relax and collapse to some degree while sleeping. for most people this doesn’t cause breathing problems.in people with osa the airway has narrowed as the result of a number of factors, including: being overweight – excessive body fat increases the bulk of soft tissue in the neck, which can place a strain on the throat muscles; excess stomach fat can also lead to breathing difficulties, which can make osa worse being male – it’s not known why osa is more common in men than in women, but it may be related to different patterns of body fat distribution being 40 years of age or more – although osa can occur at any age, it’s more common in people who are over 40 having a large neck – men with a collar size greater than around 43cm (17 inches) have an increased risk of developing osa taking medicines with a sedative effect – such as sleeping tablets or tranquillisers having an unusual inner neck structure – such as a narrow airway, large tonsils, adenoids or tongue, or a small lower jaw alcohol – drinking alcohol, particularly before going to sleep, can make snoring and sleep apnoea worse smoking – you’re more likely to develop sleep apnoea if you smoke the menopause (in women) – the changes in hormone levels during themenopausemay cause the throat muscles to relax more than usual having a family history of osa – there may be genes inherited from your parents that can make you more susceptible to osa nasal congestion – osa occurs more often in people with nasal congestion, such as a deviated septum, where the tissue in the nose that divides the two nostrils is bent to one side, or nasal polyps, which may be a result of the airways being narrowedosa is a treatable condition, and there are a variety of treatment options that can reduce the symptoms.treatment options for osa include: lifestyle changes – such as losing excess weight, cutting down on alcohol and sleeping on your side using a continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) device – these devices prevent your airway closing while you sleep by delivering a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask wearing a mandibular advancement device (mad) – this gum shield-like device fits around your teeth, holding your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat while you sleepsurgery may also be an option if osa is thought to be the result of a physical problem that can be corrected surgically, such as an unusual inner neck structure.however, for most people surgery isn’t appropriate and may only be considered as a last resort if other treatments haven’t helped.read more abouttreating osa.the treatments mentioned above can often help control the symptoms of osa, although treatment will need to be lifelong in most cases.if osa is left untreated, it can have a significant impact on your quality of life, causing problems such as poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships with others.poorly controlled osa may also increase your risk of: developinghigh blood pressure (hypertension) having astrokeorheart attack developing an irregular heartbeat – such asatrial fibrillation developingtype 2 diabetes– although it’s unclear if this is the result of an underlying cause, such as obesityresearch has shown someone who has been deprived of sleep because of osa may be up to 12 times more likely to be involved in a car accident.if you’re diagnosed with osa, it may mean your ability to drive is affected. it’s your legal obligation to inform the driver and vehicle licensing agency (dvla) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability.once a diagnosis of osa has been made, you shouldn’t drive until your symptoms are well controlled.the gov.uk website has advice abouthow to tell the dvla about a medical condition.it’s not always possible to prevent osa, but making certain lifestyle changes may reduce your risk of developing the condition.these include: losing weightif you’re overweight or obese limiting how muchalcoholyou drink and avoiding alcohol in the evening stopping smokingif you smoke avoiding the use of sleeping tablets and tranquillisersobstructive sleep apnoea (osa) can usually be diagnosed after you’ve been observed sleeping at a sleep clinic, or by using a testing device worn overnight at home.if you think you have osa, it’s important to visit your gp in case you need to be referred to a sleep specialist for further tests and treatment.before seeing your gp it may be helpful to ask a partner, friend or relative to observe you while you’re asleep, if possible. if you have osa, they may be able to spot episodes of breathlessness.it may also help to fill out an epworth sleepiness scale questionnaire. this asks how likely you’ll be to doze off in a number of different situations, such as watching tv or sitting in a meeting.the final score will help your doctor determine whether you may have a sleep disorder.for example, a score of 16-24 means you’re excessively sleepy and should consider seeking medical attention. a score of eight to nine is considered average during the daytime.an online version of theepworth sleepiness scalecan be found on the british lung foundation website.when you see your gp, they’ll usually ask a number of questions about your symptoms, such as whether you regularly fall asleep during the day against your will.your blood pressure will be measured and a blood sample probably sent off to help rule out other conditions that could explain your tiredness, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).the next step is to observe you while you’re asleep at a local sleep centre. your gp can refer you to specialist clinics or hospital departments that help treat people with sleep disorders.the sleep apnoea trust association has a list ofnhs sleep clinics in scotland.the sleep specialists at the sleep centre may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and carry out a physical examination.this may include measuring your height and weight to work out yourbody mass index (bmi), as well as measuring your neck circumference. this is because being overweight and having a large neck can increase your risk of osa.the sleep specialists will then arrange for your sleep to be assessed overnight, either by spending the night at the clinic or taking some monitoring equipment home with you and bringing it back the next day for them to analyse.in many cases the sleep centre will teach you how to use portable recording equipment while you sleep at home.the equipment you are given may include: a breathing sensor sensors to monitor your heart rate bands that are placed around your chest oxygen sensors that are put on your fingerthe equipment records oxygen levels, breathing movements, heart rate and snoring through the night.if more information about sleep quality is required, a more detailed investigation called polysomnography will be required, which will be carried out at the sleep centre.the main test carried out to analyse your sleep at a sleep centre is known as polysomnography.during the night, several different parts of your body will be carefully monitored while you sleep.bands and small metallic discs called electrodes are placed on the surface of your skin and different parts of your body. sensors are also placed on your legs and an oxygen sensor will be attached to your finger.a number of different tests will be carried out during polysomnography, including: electroencephalography (eeg) – this monitors brain waves electromyography (emg) – this monitors muscle tone recordings of movements in your chest and abdomen recordings of airflow through your mouth and nose pulse oximetry – this measures your heart rate and blood oxygen levels electrocardiography (ecg) – this monitors your heartsound recording and video equipment may also be used.if osa is diagnosed during the early part of the night, you may be given continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) treatment. cpap involves using a mask that delivers constant compressed air to the airway and stops it closing, which prevents osa.read abouttreating osafor more information about cpap.once the tests have been completed, staff at the sleep centre should have a good idea about whether or not you have osa. if you do, they can determine how much it is interrupting your sleep and recommend appropriate treatment.the severity of osa is determined by how often your breathing is affected over the course of an hour. these episodes are measured using the apnoea-hypopnoea index (ahi).severity is measured using the following criteria: mild – an ahi reading of 5 to 14 episodes an hour moderate – an ahi reading of 15 to 30 episodes an hour severe – an ahi reading of more than 30 episodes an hourcurrent evidence suggests treatment is most likely to be beneficial in people with moderate or severe osa. however, some research has suggested treatment may also help some people with mild osa.treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (osa) may include making lifestyle changes and using breathing apparatus while you sleep.osa is a long-term condition and many cases require lifelong treatment.in most cases of osa you’ll be advised to make healthy lifestyle changes, such as: losing weightif you’re overweight or obese stopping smokingif you smoke limiting your alcohol consumption, particularly before going to bed – the nhs recommends not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week; if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it’s best to spread this evenly over three or more days avoiding sedative medications and sleeping tabletslosing weight, reducing the amount of alcohol you drink and avoiding sedatives have all been shown to help improve the symptoms of osa.although it’s less clear whether stopping smoking can improve the condition, you’ll probably be advised to stop for general health reasons.sleeping on your side, rather than on your back, may also help relieve the symptoms of osa.as well as the lifestyle changes mentioned above, people with moderate to severe osa usually need to use a continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) device.this is a small pump that delivers a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask that either covers your nose or your nose and mouth. the compressed air prevents your throat closing.cpap can feel peculiar to start with and you may be tempted to stop using it. but people who persevere usually soon get used to it and their symptoms improve significantly.cpap is available on the nhs and is the most effective therapy for treating severe cases of osa.as well as reducing symptoms such as snoring and tiredness, it can also reduce the risk of complications of osa, such ashigh blood pressure.possible side effects of using a cpap device can include: mask discomfort nasal congestion, runny nose or irritation difficulty breathing through your nose headaches and ear pain stomach pain and flatulence (wind)earlier versions of cpap also often caused problems such as nasal dryness and a sore throat. however, modern versions tend to include humidifiers, a device that increases moisture, which helps reduce these side effects.if cpap causes you discomfort, inform your treatment staff as the device can be modified to make it more comfortable. for example, you can try using a cpap machine that starts with a low air pressure and gradually builds up to a higher air pressure as you fall asleep.a mandibular advancement device (mad) is a dental appliance, similar to a gum shield, sometimes used to treat mild osa.they’re not generally recommended for more severe osa, although they may be an option if you’re unable to tolerate using a cpap device.an mad is worn over your teeth when you’re asleep. it’s designed to hold your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat and reduce the narrowing of your airway that causes snoring.off-the-shelf mads are available from specialist websites, but most experts don’t recommend them, as poor-fitting mads can make symptoms worse.it’s recommended you have an mad made for you by a dentist with training and experience in treating sleep apnoea. mads aren’t always available on the nhs, so you may need to pay for the device privately through a dentist or orthodontist.an mad may not be suitable treatment for you if you don’t have many – or any – teeth. if you have dental caps, crowns or bridgework, consult your dentist to ensure they won’t be stressed or damaged by an mad.surgery to treat osa isn’t routinely recommended because evidence shows it’s not as effective as cpap at controlling the symptoms of the condition. it also carries the risk of more serious complications.surgery is usually only considered as a last resort when all other treatment options have failed, and also if the condition is severely affecting your quality of life.a range of surgical treatments have been used to treat osa. these include: tonsillectomy – where the tonsils are removed if they’re enlarged and blocking your airway when you sleep adenoidectomy – where the adenoids, small lumps of tissue at the back of the throat above the tonsils, are removed if they’re enlarged and are blocking the airway during sleep tracheostomy – where a tube is inserted directly into your neck to allow you to breathe freely, even if the airways in your upper throat are blocked weight loss (bariatric) surgery – where the size of the stomach is reduced if you’re severely obese and this is making your sleep apnoea worsesurgery to remove excess tissue in the throat to widen your airway (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty) used to be a common surgical treatment for osa, but it’s performed less often nowadays.this is because more effective treatments are available, such as cpap. this type of surgery can mean you’re unable to use a cpap device properly in the future if you need to.soft palate implants make the soft palate, part of the roof of the mouth, stiffer and less likely to vibrate and cause an obstruction. the implants are inserted into the soft palate underlocal anaesthetic.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has said soft palate implants are safe, but they’re not currently recommended for treating osa as there’s a lack of evidence about their effectiveness.however, this form of treatment is recommended for treating snoring associated with osa in exceptional cases.osa can have a significant impact on the quality of life for someone with the condition, as well as their friends and families.as well as causing physical problems such as tiredness and headaches, the condition can have a significant emotional impact and affect your relationships with others.for support and advice about living with osa, you may find it helpful to contact a support group, such as: british lung

stomach acid over many years can eventually cause changes in the cells lining the oesophagus. this is called barrett’s oesophagus.these abnormal cells are at an increased risk of becoming cancerous in

historyif your gp thinks you need to have some tests, they can refer you to a hospital specialist. this will usually be a gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions affecting the digestive system).the 2 main tests used to diagnose oesophageal cancer are: an endoscopy – this is the most common test a barium swallow or barium mealan endoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to see inside your oesophagus so they can check for cancer.a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end (an endoscope) is passed into your mouth and down towards your stomach.small samples of tissue are also removed from your oesophagus so they can be checked for cancer under a microscope. this is called abiopsy.you’ll be awake while an endoscopy is carried out. it shouldn’t be painful, but may be a bit uncomfortable.you’ll normally be givenlocal anaestheticto numb your throat and possibly a sedative to help you relax.a barium swallow or barium meal involves drinking a harmless white liquid called barium before severalx-raysare taken.the barium coats the lining of your oesophagus so it shows up on the x-ray. this can show whether there’s anything blocking your oesophagus, which may be a sign of cancer.this test isn’t used to diagnose oesophageal cancer very often nowadays because the best way to confirm a diagnosis is to use tissue samples taken during an endoscopy.if you have oesophageal cancer, further tests will be recommended to determine how far the cancer has spread – known as called the ‘stage’.these tests may include: acomputerised tomography (ct) scan– where a series of x-rays are taken and put together by a computer to create a detailed picture of the inside of your body an endoscopicultrasound scan– where a small probe that produces sound waves is passed down your throat to create an image of your oesophagus and the surrounding area apositron emission tomography (pet) scan– a scan that can help show how far the cancer has spread a laparoscopy – a type of keyhole surgery performed undergeneral anaesthetic(where you’re asleep), in which a thin tube with a camera at the end is inserted through a cut in your skin to examine the area around your oesophagusthe most widely used system for staging oesophageal cancer is the tnm system. this involves scoring the cancer in 3 categories: t (tumour) – the location and size of the tumour n (node) – whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (a network of glands throughout the body) m (metastasis) – whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver or bonesscores for each category are then often used in a simpler number system, ranging from stage 1 (early cancer) to stage 4 (advanced cancer).knowing the stage of your cancer will help your care team

oesophageal cancer macmillan:how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed macmillan:staging oesophageal cancerthe main treatments for oesophageal cancer are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.you’ll be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals and your team will recommend a treatment plan they feel is most suitable for you, although final treatment decisions will be yours.your plan will largely depend on how far your cancer has spread – known as the ‘stage’. stage 1 to 3 oesophageal cancer is usually treated with surgery to remove the affected section of oesophagus (oesophagectomy) – chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy may be given before surgery to make it more effective or is sometimes used instead of surgery stage 4 oesophageal cancer has usually spread too far for a cure to be possible, but chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other treatments can slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptomsthere are 3 main types of surgery for oesophageal cancer.an oesophagectomy is the main treatment for early-stage oesophageal cancer.during the procedure, your surgeon will remove the section of your oesophagus that contains the tumour and, if necessary, the nearby lymph nodes. a small portion of your stomach may also need to be removed.the remaining section of your oesophagus is then reconnected to your stomach.to access your oesophagus, your surgeon will either make incisions (cuts) in your tummy and chest, or in your tummy and neck.a procedure calledendoscopic mucosal resection (emr) may sometimes be an option instead of an oesophagectomy if oesophageal cancer is diagnosed very early on.it involves cutting out the tumour using a loop of wire at the end of a thin flexible tube (endoscope). the endoscope is passed down your throat so no incisions are made in your skin.sometimes radiowaves may also be used to destroy the cancerous tissue (called radiofrequency ablation or rfa).for more advanced cases of oesophageal cancer that are causing swallowing difficulties, a procedure to insert a hollow tube called a stent into the oesophagus may be recommended.the stent expands once in place and holds the oesophagus open.chemotherapyinvolves taking medicines that kill the cancer cells or stop them multiplying.it may be used: before and sometimes after surgery, either with or without radiotherapy – to shrink the cancer and reduce the risk of it coming back instead of surgery – in combination with radiotherapy (called chemoradiation) to relieve your symptoms if curative treatment isn’t possiblethe medicines can be given into a vein or taken as tablets. you’ll usually have the treatment every 3 weeks over a period of 6 to 18 weeks.common side effects of chemotherapy include: feeling sick loss of appetite

       " 'Oral thrush in adults': 'oral thrush is a fungal infection of the mouth. it’s not contagious and is usually successfully treated with antifungal medication.it’s also called oral candidosis (or candiasis) because it’s caused by a group of yeasts called candida.you develop symptoms of oral thrush, which can include:in some cases, the symptoms of oral thrush can make eating and drinking difficult.if left untreated, the symptoms will often persist and your mouth will continue to feel uncomfortable.in severe cases that are left untreated, there is also a risk of the infection spreading further into your body, which can be serious.your gp will usually be able to diagnose oral thrush simply by examining your mouth. sometimes they may also recommendblood teststo look for certain conditions associated with oral thrush, such asdiabetesand nutritional deficiencies.low numbers of the fungus candida are naturally found in the mouth and digestive system of most people. they don’t usually cause any problems, but can lead to oral thrush if they multiply.there are a number of reasons why this may happen, including: taking a course ofantibiotics, particularly over a long period or at a high dose takinginhaled corticosteroid medicationforasthma wearingdentures(false teeth), particularly if they don’t fit properly having poor oral hygiene having a dry mouth, either because of a medical condition or a medication you are taking smoking havingchemotherapyorradiotherapyto treatcancerbabies, young children and elderly people are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush, as are people with certain underlying conditions, including diabetes, aniron deficiencyorvitamin b12 deficiency, anunderactive thyroid(hypothyroidism) andhiv.as most people already have candida fungi living in their mouth, oral thrush is not contagious. this means it cannot be passed to others.oral thrush can usually be successfully treated with antifungal medicines. these usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth (topical medication), although tablets or capsules are sometimes used.topical medication will usually need to be used several times a day for around 7 to 14 days. tablet or capsules are usually taken once daily.these medications don’t often have side effects, although some can cause nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, bloating,abdominal (tummy) painanddiarrhoea.if antibiotics or corticosteroids are thought to be causing your oral thrush, the medicine – or the way it is delivered – may need to be changed or the dosage reduced.there are a number of things you can do to reduce your chances of developing oral thrush. rinse your mouth after meals brush your teeth twice a day with a toothpaste that contains fluoride floss regularly visit your dentist regularly for check-ups, even if you wear dentures or have no natural teeth remove your dentures every night and clean them with paste or soap and water before soaking them in a solution of water and denture-cleaning tablets brush your gums, tongue and inside your mouth with a soft brush twice a day if you wear dentures or have no or few natural teeth visit your dentist if your dentures do not fit properly stop smoking if you smoke rinse your mouth with water and spit it out after using a corticosteroid inhaler, and use a spacer (a plastic cylinder that attaches to the inhaler) when you take your medicine ensure that any underlying condition you have, such as diabetes, is well controlledif you have a condition or are receiving treatment that could put you at a high risk of developing oral thrush, your doctor may recommend taking a course of antifungal medication to prevent this happening. antibiotics corticosteroids taking care of your oral health diabetes uk oral health foundation: thrush oral health foundation: dentures',\n",
       " 'Osteoporosis': 'osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. it develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture.the most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are: wrist fractures hip fractures fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae)however, they can also occur in other bones, such as in the arm or pelvis. sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine.osteoporosis isn’t usually painful until a fracture occurs, but spinal fractures are a common cause of long-term (chronic) pain.although a fracture is the first sign of osteoporosis, some older people develop the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. it happens when the bones in the spine have fractured, making it difficult to support the weight of the body.osteoporosis affects over three million people in the uk.more than 500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) every year as a result of osteoporosis.losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. this can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures.women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after themenopause(when monthly periods stop and the ovaries stop producing an egg). women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45).many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including: long-term use of high-dose oralcorticosteroids other medical conditions – such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems a family history of osteoporosis – particularly history of a hip fracture in a parent long-term use of certain medications which can affect bone strength or hormone levels having a lowbody mass index (bmi) heavy drinking and smokingread more about thecauses of osteoporosis.if your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an online programme, such asfraxor q-fracture.these tools help to predict a person’s risk of fracture between the ages of 40 and 90. the algorithms used give a 10-year probability of hip fracture and a 10-year probability of a major fracture in the spine, hip, shoulder or forearm.they may also refer you for a dexa (dxa) scan to measure your bone mineral density. it’s a short, painless procedure that takes about five minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned.your bone mineral density can be compared to the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult and someone who’s the same age and sex as you. the difference is calculated as a standard deviation (sd) and is called a t score.standard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. a t score of: above -1 sd is normal between -1 and -2.5 sd is defined as decreased bone mineral density compared with peak bone mass below -2.5 is defined as osteoporosisyou may be diagnosed with osteopenia if bone density tests show you have decreased bone density, but not enough to be classed as osteoporosis.your doctor may still recommend some of the treatments described below, depending on your results and your risk of fracture.treatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing fractures, and using medication to strengthen bones.the decision about whether you need treatment depends on your risk of fracture. this will be based on a number of factors such as your age, sex and the results of your dexa scan.if you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you.read more abouthow osteoporosis is treated.if you’re at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy.

withlocal support groups.read more aboutliving with osteoporosis.osteoporosis causes bones to become less dense and more fragile. some people are more at risk than others.bones are at their thickest and strongest in your early adult life and their density increases until your late 20s. you gradually start losing bone density from around the age of 35.this happens to everyone, but some people develop osteoporosis and lose bone density much faster than normal. this means they’re at greater risk of a fracture.osteoporosis can affect men and women. it’s more common in older people, but it can also affect younger people.women are more at risk of developing osteoporosis than men because the hormone changes that occur in the menopause directly affect bone density.the female hormone oestrogen is essential for healthy bones. after themenopause(when monthly periods stop), oestrogen levels fall. this can lead to a rapid decrease in bone density.women are at even greater risk of developing osteoporosis if they have: an early menopause (before the age of 45) a hysterectomy (removal of the womb) before the age of 45, particularly when the ovaries are also removed absent periods for more than six months as a result of overexercising or too much dietingin most cases, the cause of osteoporosis in men is unknown. however, there’s a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps keep the bones healthy.men continue producing testosterone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in men with low levels of testosterone.in around half of men, the exact cause of low testosterone levels is unknown, but known causes include: the use of certain medications, such as oral corticosteroids alcohol misuse hypogonadism (a condition that causes abnormally low testosterone levels)many hormones in the body can affect the process of bone turnover. if you have a condition of the hormone-producing glands, you may have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis.hormone-related conditions that can trigger osteoporosis include: hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) disorders of the adrenal glands, such as cushing’s syndrome reduced amounts of sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone) disorders of the pituitary gland hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands)other factors thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include: a family history of osteoporosis a parental history of hip fracture abody mass index (bmi)of 19 or less long-term use of high-dose oralcorticosteroids(widely used for conditions such asarthritisandasthma),

osteoporosis and broken boneson theroyal osteoporosis society website.although a diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on the results of your bone mineral density scan (dexa or dxa scan), the decision about what treatment you need – if any – is also based on a number of other factors. these include your: age sex risk of fracture previous injury historyif you’ve been diagnosed with osteoporosis because you’ve had a fracture, you should still receive treatment to try to reduce your risk of further fractures.you may not need or want to take medication to treat osteoporosis. however, you should ensure you’re maintaining sufficient levels of calcium and vitamin d. to achieve this, your healthcare team will ask you about your diet and may recommend making changes or taking supplements.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has made some recommendations about who should be treated with medication for osteoporosis.a number of factors are taken into consideration before deciding which medication to use. these include your: age bone mineral density (measured by your t score) risk factors for fracturenice has summarised its guidance for two groups of people: postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who haven’t had a fracture (primary prevention) postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who have had a fracture (secondary prevention)you can read the nice guidance by clicking on the links below. nice guidance:alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and strontium ranelate for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women nice guidance:alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate and teriparatide for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal womena number of different medications are used to treat osteoporosis. your doctor will discuss the treatments available and make sure the medicines are right for you.bisphosphonates slow down the rate at which bone is broken down in your body. this maintains bone density and reduces the risk of fracture.there are a number of different bisphosphonates, including alendronate etidronate ibandronate risedronate zolendronic acidthey’re given as a tablet or injection.you should always take bisphosphonates on an empty stomach with a full glass of water. stand or sit upright for 30 minutes after taking them. you’ll also need to wait between 30 minutes and two hours before eating food or drinking any other fluids.bisphosphonates usually take 6 to 12 months to work and you may need to take them for five years or longer. you may also be prescribed calcium and vitamin d supplements to take at a different time to the bisphosphonate.the main side effects associated with bisphosphonates include: irritation to the oesophagus (the tube that food passes through from the mouth to the stomach) swallowing problems (dysphagia) stomach painnot everyone will experience these side effects.osteonecrosis of the jaw is a rare side effect that’s linked with the use of bisphosphonates, although most frequently with high-dose intravenous bisphosphonate treatment forcancerand not for osteoporosis.in osteonecrosis, the cells in the jaw bone die, which can lead to problems with healing. if you have a history of dental problems, you may need a check-up before you start treatment with bisphosphonates. speak to your doctor if you have any concerns.strontium ranelate appears to have an effect on both the cells that break down bone and the cells that create new bone (osteoblasts).it can be used as an alternative treatment if bisphosphonates are unsuitable. strontium ranelate is taken as a powder dissolved in water.the main side effects of strontium ranelate are nausea anddiarrhoea. a few people have reported a rare severe allergic reaction to the treatment. if you develop a skin rash while taking strontium ralenate, stop taking it and speak to your doctor immediately.serms are medications that have a similar effect on bone as the hormone oestrogen. they help to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture, particularly of the spine.raloxifene is the only type of serm that’s available for treating osteoporosis. it’s taken as a tablet every day.side effects associated with raloxifene include: hot flushes leg cramps a potential increased risk ofblood clotsparathyroid hormone is produced naturally in the body. it regulates the amount of calcium in bone.parathyroid hormone treatments (human recombinant parathyroid hormone or teriparatide) are used to stimulate cells that create new bone (osteoblasts). they’re given by injection.while other medication can only slow down the rate of bone thinning, parathyroid hormone can increase bone density. however, it’s only used in a small number of people whose bone density is very low and when other treatments aren’t working.nausea and vomiting are common side effects of the treatment. parathyroid hormone treatments should only be prescribed by a specialist.calcium is the major mineral found in bone, and having enough calcium as part of ahealthy, balanced dietis important for maintaining healthy bones.for most healthy adults, the recommended amount of calcium is 700 milligrams (mg) of calcium a day, which most people should be able to get from a varied diet that contains good sources of calcium.however, if you have osteoporosis you may need more calcium, which will usually be in the form of supplements. ask your gp for advice about taking calcium supplements.vitamin d is needed to help the body absorb calcium. it’s difficult to get enough vitamin d from your diet alone because few foods contain vitamin d. in the uk, most healthy adults obtain vitamin d from exposing the skin to summer sunlight.however, for people at risk of not getting enough vitamin d, supplementation with 10 micrograms of vitamin d a day (400 international units [iu]) is recommended to prevent deficiency.at-risk groups include people over 65 years of age, and people who aren’t exposed to much sunlight because they cover their skin for cultural reasons, are housebound, or who stay indoors for long periods.if you’re found to lack vitamin d, your gp may prescribe supplements at a higher dose than the above recommendation to correct the deficiency.hrtis sometimes recommended for women who are experiencing themenopause, as it can help control symptoms.hrt has also been shown to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture during treatment.however, hrt isn’t specifically recommended for treating osteoporosis and it isn’t often used for this purpose.this is because hrt slightly increases the risk of developing certain conditions, such asbreast cancer,endometrial cancer,ovarian cancer,strokeand venous thromboembolism more than it lowers the risk of osteoporosis.discuss the benefits and risks of hrt with your gp.read more about therisks of hrt.in men, testosterone treatment can be useful when osteoporosis is caused by insufficient production of male sex hormones (hypogonadism).your genes are responsible for determining your height and the strength of your skeleton, but lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise influence how healthy your bones are.regular exercise is essential. adults aged 19 to 64 should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such ascyclingor fastwalking, every week.weight-bearing exercise and resistance exercise are particularly important for improving bone density and helping to prevent osteoporosis.as well as aerobic exercise, adults aged 19 to 64 should also do muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week by working all the major muscle groups, including the legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, arms and shoulders.if you’ve been diagnosed with osteoporosis, it’s a good idea to talk to your gp or health specialist before starting a new exercise programme to make sure it’s right for you.read more about thephysical activity guidelines for adults.weight-bearing exercises are exercises where your feet and legs support your weight. high-impact weight-bearing exercises, such asrunning, skipping, dancing, aerobics, and even jumping up and down on the spot, are all useful ways to strengthen your muscles, ligaments and joints.when exercising, wear footwear that provides your ankles and feet with adequate support, such as trainers or walking boots.people over the age of 60 can also benefit from regular weight-bearing exercise. this can include brisk walking, keep-fit classes or a game of tennis.swimmingand cycling aren’t weight-bearing exercises, however.read more aboutphysical activity guidelines for older adults.resistance exercises use muscle strength, where the action of the tendons pulling on the bones boosts bone strength. examples include press-ups, weightlifting or using weight equipment at a gym.if you’ve recently joined a gym or haven’t been for a while, your gym will probably offer you an induction. this involves being shown how to use the equipment and having exercise techniques recommended to you.always ask an instructor for help if you’re not sure how to use a piece of gym equipment or how to do a particular exercise.eating ahealthy, balanced dietis recommended for everyone. it can help prevent many serious health conditions, includingheart disease,diabetesand many forms ofcancer, as well as osteoporosis.calcium is important for maintaining strong bones. adults need 700mg a day, which you should be able to get from your daily diet. calcium-rich foods include: leafy green vegetables dried fruit tofu yoghurtvitamin d is also important for healthy bones and teeth because it helps your body absorb calcium. vitamin d can be found in: eggs milk oily fishhowever, most vitamin d is made in the skin in response to sunlight. short exposure to sunlight without wearing sunscreen (10 minutes twice a day) throughout the summer should provide you with enough vitamin d for the whole year.certain groups of people may be at risk of not getting enough vitamin d. these include: people who are housebound or particularly frail people with a poor diet people who keep covered up in sunlight because they wear total sun block or adhere to a certain dress code women who are pregnant or breastfeedingif you’re at risk of not getting enough vitamin d through your diet or lifestyle, you can take a vitamin d supplement. for adults, 10 micrograms a day of vitamin d is recommended.the recommended amount for children is 7 micrograms for babies under six months, and 8.5 micrograms for children aged six months to three years. talk to your gp for more information.read

make sure the bone is set properly.hip replacementsare often needed after hip fractures, and some people may lose mobility as a result of weakened bones.osteoporosis can cause a loss of height due to fractures in the spinal column. this means the spine is no longer able to support your body’s weight and causes a hunched posture.this can be painful when it occurs, but it may also lead to long-term

       " 'Osteosarcoma': 'osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer. osteosarcomas occur more commonly in older children and teenagers and are very rarely seen in children under 5.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments. but it remains devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information. if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.osteosarcoma often starts at the end of the long bones, where new bone tissue forms as a young person grows. any bone in the body can be affected. the most common sites are in the arms and legs, particularly around the knee and shoulder joints.there are several different types of osteosarcoma. most occur in the centre of the bone. there are also rare subtypes, such as parosteal, periosteal, telangiectatic, and small cell osteosarcoma.there has been a lot of research into the causes of osteosarcoma but, like most childhood cancers, a definite cause is unknown. there are a few risk factors that have been associated with osteosarcoma. children who have hereditaryretinoblastoma(a rare tumour of the eye) have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. children who have previously had radiotherapy and chemotherapy also have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. it is not caused by injuries or damage to the bone, although an injury may draw attention to a bone tumour.pain in the affected bone is the most common symptom. this pain may initially come and go, and then gradually become more severe and constant especially at night. there may also be swelling around the affected bone. osteosarcoma is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the person has had a minor fall or accident. some patients may develop a limp if the tumour is in the leg or pelvis.these symptoms can be caused by many things other than cancer. however, any persistent bone pain should be checked by your child’s doctor. symptoms are often attributed to a sporting injury.usually you begin by seeing your gp, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or x-rays. if a bone tumour is suspected, the doctor will refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre for further tests.the doctor at the hospital will take your child’s full medical history. they will then do a physical examination. this will include an examination of the painful bone to check for any swelling or tenderness. your child will probably have a blood test to check their general health.a variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose osteosarcoma. an x-ray of the painful part of the bone will usually identify a tumour, although sometimes they can be difficult to see.a small piece of the tumour will be removed and looked at under a microscope. this is called a biopsy. it’s a small operation, performed under a general anaesthetic.other tests are done to check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. these include a chestx-ray,blood tests, a bone scan and anmriorct scan.any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.grading refers to the appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope, and gives an idea of how quickly the cancer may develop. low-grade cancer cells are usually slow-growing and less likely to spread.in high-grade tumours the cells are likely to grow quickly and are more likely to spread.most osteosarcomas are high-grade, but a type known as parosteal osteosarcoma is usually low-grade.the ‘stage’ of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.most patients are grouped depending on whether cancer is found in only one part of the body (localised disease), or whether the cancer has spread from one part of the body to another (metastatic disease).a staging system commonly used for osteosarcomas is described below:the cancer is low-grade and is only found within the hard coating of the bone.the cancer is low-grade, extending outside the bone and into the soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels.the cancer is high-grade and is completely contained within the hard coating of the bone.the cancer is high-grade and has spread outside the bone and into surrounding soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels. most osteosarcomas are stage 2b.the cancer can be low or high-grade and is either found within the bone or extends outside the bone. the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or to other bones not directly connected to the bone where the tumour started.if the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer.treatment will depend on a number of factors including the size, position, and stage of the tumour.chemotherapyis a very important part of treatment for osteosarcoma. chemotherapy uses anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells, and is usually given to shrink the main tumour before surgery. it’s also given after the tumour has been removed by surgery, to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). it’s common for a combination of drugs to be used.radiotherapymay occasionally be given. this treats cancer by using high energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.the type and extent of surgery depends on the position and size of the tumour in the body. this surgery will need to be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic centre, and your child should be referred to one.surgery may include removing the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone, which is then replaced by some form of false limb (prosthesis). if only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery. most children will be considered for limb-sparing surgery.sometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer is affecting the surrounding blood vessels and nerves.after amputation, a false limb will be fitted and will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. false limbs can work very well. it should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sports.there are 2 ways that limb-sparing surgery may be done:after this type of surgery, children will usually be able to use their limbs almost normally. however, they are advised not to participate in any contact sports. this is because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it.if your child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened as the bone grows. this may mean there are extra short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened as an outpatient procedure.mifamurtide, also called mepact®, is a new type of biological therapy treatment. it may be offered to your child if they have had a surgical resection to remove the osteosarcoma and the tumour has not spread. it will be given along with chemotherapy after surgery to try and stop the osteosarcoma coming back. mifamurtide is a relatively new drug and so more research needs to be done to fully understand its side effects and how to use it best.treatment often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. any possible side effects will depend upon the treatment being given and the part of the body that’s being treated.some general side effects of chemotherapy can include: feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) hair loss increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness diarrhoearadiotherapy can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness.if your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having.a small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. these include a reduction in bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you and monitor your child for any potential late effects.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial, if there is a suitable one open. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a

any questions you have. written information will be provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. your child’s doctor can tell you if there are any trials available that might be suitable for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.many children with osteosarcoma are cured. however, your child may need to have surgery to lengthen the affected limb as they grow. your child will have regular check-ups and x-rays in the paediatric or adolescent oncology clinic, and at the orthopaedic centre.if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.',\n",
       " 'Outer ear infection (otitis externa)': 'otitis externa is an infection that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the ear canal, which is the tube between the outer ear and the eardrum.otitis externa is often called ‘swimmer’s ear’ because regularly getting water in your ear can make inflammation more likely.symptoms of otitis externa include:usually, only one ear is affected.with treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days. some cases can persist for several months or longer.pharmacists can give advice and treatment about outer ear infections.your pharmacist may advise you to speak to your gp practice if needed.your pharmacist or gp will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly put things into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. they may also examine inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope.if you have otitis externa often, and treatment doesn’t help, your gp may take a swab of the inside of your ear. this will be tested to help check what type of infection you have, if any, so the right medication can be prescribed.most cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection. it can also be caused by: irritation fungal infections allergiesthere are a things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa, including: damaging the skin inside your ear – for example by scratching or picking your ear regularly getting water in your ear – for example by swimminggetting water in your ear can cause you to scratch inside your ear, and the moisture also provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.otitis externa is quite common. it’s estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives.the condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults 45 to 75 years of age.people with certain long-term (chronic) conditions are at greater risk of developing the condition. these include: eczema dermatitisotitis externa sometimes gets better without treatment, but it can take several weeks.to help your symptoms and help prevent complications, you should: avoid getting your affected ear wet – wearing a shower cap while showering and bathing if you aren’t washing your hair can help avoid swimming until the condition has fully cleared remove any discharge by gently swabbing your outer ear with cotton wool – do not stick cotton wool or a cotton bud inside your ear remove anything from your affected ear that may cause an allergic reaction, such as hearing aids, ear plugs and earrings use pain relief such asparacetamoloribuprofento relieve ear pain – these aren’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you check the information leaflet that comes with the medication first and if you’re still unsure, check with your gp, practice nurse or pharmacist if your condition is caused by a boil in your ear, placing a warm flannel or cloth over the affected ear can help it heal fasteryour pharmacist or gp can prescribe ear drops that usually improve symptoms within a few days.there are different types of ear drops that may be used to treat otitis externa. you usually use them several times a day for about a week.your gp may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice if your symptoms are severe, or treatment does not help.there are things you can do to reduce your chances of developing otitis externa. consider wearing a swimming cap or using ear plugs if you’re a regular swimmer – but make sure you insert ear plugs carefully and don’t use them if they irritate your ears ifearwax build-upis a problem, have it removed by a healthcare professional keep your ears dry and clean turn your head from side to side after getting out of water – this helps water drain from your ears do not insert cotton wool buds or other things into your ears (including your fingers) – this can damage the sensitive skin in your ear canal do not swim in polluted wateryou should also try to avoid getting water, soap or shampoo into your ears when you have a shower or bath. self-help guide: earache hearing loss british tinnitus association action on hearing loss',\n",
       " 'Ovarian cancer': 'ovarian cancer is most common in women and anyone with ovaries who has been through themenopause(usually over the age of 50). it can affect women and anyone with ovaries of any age.as thesymptoms of ovarian cancercan be similar to those of other conditions, it can be difficult to recognise. however, there are early symptoms to look out for, such as persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach, and difficulty eating.it’s important to speak to your gp if you experience these symptoms, particularly over a long period of time. read more abouthow ovarian cancer is diagnosed.the ovaries are a pair of small organs in the female reproductive system that contain and release an egg once a month. this is known as ovulation.different types of ovarian canceraffect different parts of the ovaries. epithelial ovarian cancer, which affects the surface layers of the ovary, is the most common type. this topic focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer.the exact cause of ovarian cancer is unknown, but certain things are thought to increase a woman’s risk of developing the condition, such as age, the number of eggs the ovaries release and whether someone in your family has had ovarian or breast cancer in the past. however, only 1 in 10 cases of ovarian cancer has a genetic link.read more about thecauses of ovarian cancerthe treatment you receive for ovarian cancer will depend on several things, including the stage of your cancer and your general health.chemotherapyis the main treatment for ovarian cancer, but your treatment will usually involve a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.read more abouthow ovarian cancer is treatedas with most types of cancer, the outlook for ovarian cancer will depend on the stage it’s at when diagnosed – that is, how far the cancer has advanced.being diagnosed with ovarian cancer can affect daily life in many ways. however, support is available for many aspects of living with ovarian cancer, including emotional, financial and long-term health issues.there are methods of screening for ovarian cancer but, currently, they haven’t been fully tested. screening is only available for women and anyone with ovaries who are at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history or inheritance of a particular faulty gene. clinical trials in the uk are currently being carried out to assess the effectiveness of screening in high-risk groups and in the general population. acervical screening test, which used to be called a smear test, can’t detect ovarian cancer.read more aboutpreventing ovarian cancerthe symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, particularly in its early stages.this is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such asirritable bowel syndrome (ibs)or pre-menstrual syndrome (pms).however, 3 main symptoms are more frequent: increased abdominal size and persistent bloating (not bloating that comes and goes) persistent pelvic and abdominal pain difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseousother symptoms, such as back pain, needing to pass urine more frequently than usual, and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area. however, they may be a sign of ovarian cancer.if you have these types of symptoms, try keeping a diary to record how many of these symptoms you have over a longer period. bear in mind that ovarian cancer is rare in women and anyone with ovaries under 40 years of age.speak to your gp if you have these symptoms regularly (on most days for 3 weeks or more). although it’s unlikely they’re being caused by a serious problem, it’s best to check.if you’ve already seen your gp and the symptoms continue or get worse, you should go back and explain this. you know your body better than anyone.several possible causes of ovarian cancer have been identified, along with risks that may make developing the condition more likely.cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the dna in cells, which can affect how they grow. this means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.in ovarian cancer, cells in the ovary start to change and grow abnormally. if the cancer isn’t identified at an early stage, it can spread to the abdomen and pelvis, including other parts of the female reproductive system.the exact cause of epithelial ovarian cancer (the main type) isn’t known, but certain things may increase your risk of developing it.your risk of ovarian cancer increases with age, with most cases occurring after themenopause. most cases of ovarian cancer occur in women and anyone with ovaries who are over 50 years of age.if you have 2 or more close relatives (mother, sister or daughter) who developed ovarian cancer orbreast cancer, your risk of also developing the condition may be increased.if your relatives developed cancer before the age of 50, it’s more likely it was the result of an inherited faulty gene. brca1 and brca2 are faulty genes that are linked to ovarian cancer. they’re also known to increase the risk of breast cancer.having relatives with ovarian cancer doesn’t mean you definitely have a faulty gene in the family – the cancer could have happened by chance. only 1 in 10 (10%) of ovarian cancers are thought to be caused by a faulty gene.you may be at high risk of having a faulty gene if you have: 1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 2 close relatives with breast cancer whose average age is under 60; all of these relatives should be on the same side of your family (either your mother’s or father’s side) 1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 1 close relative diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50; both of these relatives should come from the same side of your family 2 relatives from the same side of the family diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any ageif you’re at a higher risk of having a faulty gene, your gp can refer you for tests to check for faulty brca1 and brca2 genes.every time an egg is released into the reproductive system, the surface of the ovary breaks to let it out. the surface of the ovary is damaged during this process and needs to be repaired. each time this happens, there’s a greater chance of abnormal cell growth during the repair.this may be why the risk of ovarian cancer decreases if you take thecontraceptive pill, or have multiple pregnancies or periods of breastfeeding. at these times, eggs aren’t released.there’s no strong evidence to show that those who have infertility treatment have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. however, it’s thought thatinfertilityitself may increase ovarian cancer risk and research into this area is being carried out.women and anyone with ovaries who take hormone replacement therapy (hrt) have been shown to have a small increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. however, if hrt is stopped, after 5 years the risk is reduced to the same level as those who’ve never taken hrt.endometriosismay also increase your risk of ovarian cancer. in endometriosis, the cells that usually line the womb grow elsewhere in the body.these endometrial cells behave as if they were in the womb, so thickening and bleeding that usually occurs during menstruation, occurs in other parts of the body. there’s no way for this endometrial tissue to leave the body so it becomes trapped, leading to pain, swelling and bleeding in that area.read further information: cancer research

health and whether there’s a history of ovarian orbreast cancerin your family.they may carry out an internal examination and may take a blood sample or refer you for anultrasound scan.if needed, you may also be referred to a specialist (a gynaecologist or gynaecological oncologist) at a hospital.in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected ovarian cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.you may have a blood test to look for a protein called ca125 in your blood. ca125 is produced by some ovarian cancer cells. a very high level of ca125 may indicate that you have ovarian cancer.however, ca125 isn’t specific to ovarian cancer and it can be raised in conditions includingendometriosis,fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease and pregnancy, so a raised ca125 level doesn’t definitely mean you have ovarian cancer.the lab tests online uk website has more information on theca125 test.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has produced guidance that recommends testing for ca125 if you frequently experience: bloating feeling full quickly and/or loss of appetite pelvic or abdominal pain needing to urinate urgently and/or frequentlyread the fullnice guidance about the recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer (pdf, 179kb).if you experience unexplained weight loss, fatigue or changes in your bowel habits, such asdiarrhoeaorconstipation, you may also be tested for ca125.if you’re 50 or over and you’ve experienced symptoms that could suggestirritable bowel syndrome (ibs)in the last 12 months, such as bloating, abdominal pain or changes in your bowel habits, your gp should test your ca125 level.around half of all women and anyone with ovaries with early-stage ovarian cancer have a raised level of ca125 in their blood. if your ca125 level is raised, you’ll be referred for an ultrasound scan.an ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your ovaries. you may have an internal ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina, or you may have an external ultrasound, where the probe is put next to your stomach.the image produced can show the size and texture of your ovaries, plus any cysts or other swellings that are present.if you’ve been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you may have further tests to see how large the cancer is and if it’s spread. this is called staging.other tests you may have include: a chestx-ray act scanormri scan abdominal fluid aspiration – a thin needle is passed into your abdomen, so that a fluid sample can be taken and tested for cancerous cells laparoscopy – a thin tube with a camera on the end is inserted through a small incision in your lower abdomen, so that your ovaries can be examined; a small tissue sample may also be taken from your ovaries for testing (abiopsy)staging helps your doctors to decide on the best kind of treatment for your condition. however, it’s important to remember that the stage of your ovarian cancer alone cannot predict how your condition will progress.the cancer research uk website has more information onfurther tests for ovarian cancer.if your test results indicate that you have ovarian cancer, it will be given a stage. the stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread. the 4 commonly used stages of ovarian cancer are: stage 1 – where the cancer only affects one or both of the ovaries stage 2 – where the cancer has spread from the ovary and into the pelvis or womb stage 3 – where the cancer has spread to the lining of the abdomen, the surface of the bowel and the lymph nodes in the pelvis stage 4 – where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver, spleen or lungsthis is a simplified guide. each stage is further divided into categories a, b and c. ask your doctor if you’re not sure what stage you have.the grade of cancer refers to the appearance of cells under a microscope. the grades are as follows: low grade – although abnormal, cells appear to be slow-growing moderate grade – cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells high grade – cells look very abnormal and are likely to be fast-growingthe cancer research uk website has more information on thestages and grading of ovarian cancer.most people with ovarian cancer will be considered for surgery. it sometimes isn’t possible to confirm the stage of the cancer until surgery is carried out.your doctor will discuss what will happen during surgery. it will probably involve removing: both ovaries and the fallopian tubes (a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) the womb (a total abdominal hysterectomy) the omentum – a fatty layer of tissue within the abdomen (an omentectomy)the surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes from your pelvis and abdomen, and samples of nearby tissue, to find out whether the cancer has spread.if it has spread, the surgeon will try to remove as much of it as possible. this is known as ‘debulking surgery’.if the cancer is confined to 1 or both ovaries, you may only need to have the ovary or ovaries removed, leaving your womb intact. this means you may still be able to carry a pregnancy.you will probably be ready to go home 3 to 7 days after your operation, but it can take many weeks to fully recover.when you go home, you’ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness.walkingandswimmingare good exercises that are suitable for most people after treatment for ovarian cancer. discuss the types of exercise that are suitable for you with your doctor or physiotherapist.read further information: cancer research uk: surgery for ovarian cancer macmillan cancer support: ovarian cancer surgerychemotherapyinvolves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill cancer cells. it’s often given after surgery for ovarian cancer. in some cases, it can be given before surgery to help shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. this is called ‘neoadjuvant chemotherapy’.several different medicines can be used in chemotherapy. a combination is often given. the choice of medicine and how and when it’s given depends on the stage of your cancer and how much it has spread. the most common treatment for ovarian cancer is a platinum-containing medicine (carboplatin), which is used alone or in combination with another medicine called paclitaxel.chemotherapy is usually given as a drip into the vein, but is sometimes given as tablets. some studies have looked at giving chemotherapy directly into the abdomen – called ‘intraperitoneal chemotherapy’. it is not currently established routine practice in the uk, but it’s being assessed in clinical trials.you’ll usually have chemotherapy as an outpatient, but you may sometimes need a short stay in hospital. it’s usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment followed by a period of rest, to allow the body to recover. most women and anyone with ovaries have 6 cycles of chemotherapy.over the course of your chemotherapy, you’ll have tests to monitor how the cancer is responding to treatment. this can be done in a number of ways. for example: if you had higher than normal levels of the protein ca125 in your blood when diagnosed, you may haveblood teststo see whether the levels are falling if you had a tumour visible on act scanorultrasound scanwhen diagnosed, you may have repeated scans to see whether it has shrunk you may have another small operation, known as ‘second-look surgery’, which is carried out in the same way as a laparoscopyafter your chemotherapy treatment, if all of your tests are clear of cancer, you’ll be in remission. this means the cancer is under control.side effects of chemotherapy include: infections loss of appetite nausea and vomiting tiredness hair loss sore mouthmany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe.ovarian cancer can come back (relapse) after treatment. if this happens, you may have another course of chemotherapy. this is called ‘second-line treatment’.read further information: cancer research uk: chemotherapy for ovarian cancer macmillan cancer

treatment. more women and anyone with ovaries are living longer and experiencing fewer side effects. these advances were discovered through clinical trials, where new medicines and combinations of medicines are compared with standard treatment.all cancer trials in the uk are subject to careful monitoring, to ensure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. participants in clinical trials can often do better overall than in routine care.if you’re asked about taking part in a trial, you’ll be offered an information sheet. if you wish to take part, you’ll be asked to give your consent

with cancer can be a huge challenge for patients and their families. it can bring emotional and practical difficulties.it often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. you can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. there are various ways to find help and support. for example: your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or gp can refer you to a counsellor; talk to your gp if you’re feeling depressed; a course ofantidepressantsmay help, or your gp can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist it can help to talk to someone who’s been through the same thing as you; many organisations have helplines and online forums; they can also put you in touch with other people who have had cancer treatmentread further

time, you’ll have to avoid lifting things, such as children and heavy shopping bags, and doing heavy housework. you won’t be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks after the operation. you’ll usually need 4 to 12 weeks off work after a hysterectomy.if your ovaries have been removed and you haven’t already been through themenopause, you’ll experience the menopause after your treatment. you may decide to takehormone replacement therapy (hrt)to control your symptoms. your gp will help you decide what’s best for you.some treatments for ovarian cancer, particularlychemotherapy, can make you feel very tired. you may need a break from your normal activities for a while. don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it.practical help may also be available from your local authority. ask your doctor or nurse who to contact.after your treatment has finished, you’ll be invited for regular check-ups to see how well you are responding to treatments. these are usually every 2 to 3 months to begin with.having cancer isn’t always easy to talk about, either for you or your family and friends. you may sense that some people avoid you or feel awkward around you.being

care: support for people dying at homethere’s currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer. however, there are a number of things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer.each time you ovulate, your ovaries are damaged by the egg as it breaks through the surface of the ovary and is released into your reproductive system.the cells that make up the surface of your ovaries divide and multiply rapidly to repair the damage caused by the egg. it’s this rapid cell growth that can occasionally go wrong and result in ovarian cancer.anything that stops the process of ovulation can help to minimise your chances of developing ovarian cancer. this includes: pregnancy andbreastfeeding thecontraceptive pill hysterectomy surgery (removal of the ovaries)ovarian cancer may be linked to being overweight orobese.losing weightthroughregular exerciseand ahealthy, balanced dietmay help lower your risk of getting ovarian cancer. aside from this, regular exercise and a healthy, low-fat diet are extremely beneficial to your overall health, and can help to prevent all forms of cancer andheart disease.at present, there’s no screening method for ovarian cancer that is reliable enough to be used by all women and anyone with ovaries in the uk. clinical trials into this are continuing.you may be eligible for screening if you’re at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history, or if you’ve inherited a specific abnormal gene.if you’re at high risk, your gp can refer you to your local genetics service or family cancer clinic. you may be screened for ovarian cancer when you’re over the age of 35, or when you’re 5 years away from the age at which your youngest relative was diagnosed with the condition. from this point, you’ll be screened again once a year.the screening tests for ovarian cancer are the same as those routinely used to diagnose it. the tests are: ablood testfor higher-than-normal levels of ca125 (a protein produced by cancer cells) a transvaginalultrasound– where an ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina so that the size and texture of your ovaries can be seen, as well as anyovarian cyststhat may be presentthe tests are used together to produce results that are as accurate as possible. however, as these screening methods are still in the process of being tested, there’s no guarantee they’ll identify every case of

cancersection.ovarian cancer starts in the ovaries, which are part of the reproductive system. this is in the lower part of your tummy (abdomen), in the area between your hips (called the pelvis). your reproductive system is made up of your vagina and the organs involved in getting pregnant and having a baby.your reproductive system is made up of the: vagina – the passage from the cervix to outside your body cervix – the opening from the womb to the vagina womb (also called uterus) – where a baby grows during pregnancy fallopian tubes – which connect your ovaries to the womb ovaries – which store all your eggs and release one every month after pubertyyou have 2 ovaries – 1 on each side of your womb. they’re about 4cm long.at puberty your ovaries start making hormones called oestrogen and progesterone. these cause your breasts to grow and your periods to start.every month after puberty, your ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes to the womb. the womb’s lining gets thicker, ready for an egg to be fertilised by a man’s sperm. if this doesn’t happen, the womb’s lining comes out of your vagina as blood. this is a period.when a woman is about 50 her periods stop because her ovaries have run out of eggs so they stop making hormones. this is called the menopause.there are 3 types of ovarian cancer: epithelial tumours, germ cell tumours and stromal cell tumours.teenagers are mostly affected by the germ cell tumour type. you may hear your type of germ cell tumour being called: dysgerminoma teratoma yolk sac tumourgerm cell tumours of the

germ cell tumours of the ovary – causes and symptoms treatment of ovarian cancer living with and after ovarian cancerif you’re looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read ourovarian cancersection.most girls and young women can be cured of germ cell tumours of the ovary.your treatment will depend on the type of germ cell tumour you have and whether it has spread outside the ovaries. treatment is usually a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, although you may only need surgery.before you have treatment, your specialist needs to know the type of germ cell tumour you have and what stage it is. the stage of a cancer describes the size of the tumour and whether it has spread outside the ovary to any other parts of your body.your specialist will tell you the exact stage of the cancer after the operation to remove your ovary. most germ cell tumours are diagnosed early when they’re in one or sometimes both ovaries but haven’t spread anywhere else in the body. waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. but this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment.another important part of ovarian cancer treatment is to try to make sure it doesn’t make you infertile (unable to get pregnant). your doctors will think very carefully about this when planning your treatment.you may have anoperationto remove the affected ovary and the fallopian tube. if it’s a very early germ cell tumour this might be the only treatment you need. after your operation you’ll come back to the clinic for regular checks. if there are any signs of the cancer coming back, it’s treated straight away.having the affected ovary and fallopian tube removed won’t stop you from having a baby in the future. you can still get pregnant with only 1 ovary.before surgery you’ll have a general anaesthetic. during the operation, the surgeon will make a cut in the lower tummy. the ovary is removed through this cut. the operation is called a laparotomy.if the cancer has spread, the surgeon may still do an operation to try to remove as much of the tumour as they can. if possible they will try to leave the other ovary and the womb. you will have more treatment after your operation to treat any of the tumour that they could not remove.removing both ovaries and the womb is only done if there’s no other way of successfully treating the cancer. unfortunately this means you will not be able to get pregnant in the future. this can be very upsetting news. you may not have thought about having children yet, so it may be difficult to take in. if this happens there will be lots of support to help you.chemotherapyis given after your operation to: get rid of any cancer cells that weren’t removed with surgery stop the cancer from coming backyour specialist will explain more about this to you. germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy and this treatment cures most girls. if it’s a very early germ cell tumour you might not even need chemotherapy.germ cell tumours are often treated with the drugs bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin. when these are given together it’s called bep for short.chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment that usually take 3 weeks. you’ll have 3 to 4 cycles. you’ll spend the first 3 to 5 days of each cycle having your chemotherapy. you’ll usually stay in hospital for those days. you’ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and then again the following week.different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. some girls just have a few side effects, and others have more.most side effects are temporary and gradually disappear once treatment stops. the most common side effects are: hair loss tiredness feeling sick or being sick (this can often be controlled with medicine) being more at risk of getting an infectiondoctors can’t be certain whether you’ll be able to get pregnant (fertility) in the future after you’ve had chemotherapy. they may talk to you about storing your eggs before chemotherapy starts. stored eggs can be used with fertility treatments when you’re ready to try to get pregnant. read more in macmillan’s section onfertility in young women.you’ll usually have chemotherapy after your surgery. you might have more surgery after you’ve finished chemotherapy if there’s still some tumour left behind.radiotherapytreats cancer by using high-energy x-rays to destroy cancer cells. some types of germ cell tumour are sensitive to radiotherapy, but it is rarely used.we have

       " 'Ovarian cyst': \"an ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on an ovary. they’re very common and do not usually cause any symptoms.most ovarian cysts are generally harmless and disappear without treatment in a few months.small cysts are normal in the ovary. there may only be a problem is there are a large number of cysts, they’re persistent, or become particularly large.ovarian cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect one.the ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. they are 2 small, bean-shaped organs, one each side of the womb (uterus).the ovaries have 2 main functions. they are:the 2 main types of ovarian are: functional ovarian cysts (most common) – develop as part of themenstrual cycleand are usually harmless and short-lived pathological ovarian cysts (much less common) – occur due to abnormal cell growthovarian cysts can sometimes also be caused by an underlying condition, such asendometriosis.the vast majority of ovarian cysts are non-cancerous (benign). but a small number are cancerous (malignant).most cysts are found by chance during a scan. they’re unlikely to cause any symptoms unless they’re large or abnormal.an ovarian cyst will usually only cause symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large, or it blocks the blood supply to the ovaries. you have sudden, severe pelvic painif your gp is closed, phone 111.you’re worried about your symptoms or you regularly have: pelvic pain – this can range from a dull, heavy sensation to a sudden, severe and sharp pain pain during sex difficulty having a poo a frequent need to urinate heavy periods,irregular periodsor lighter periods than normal bloating and a swollen tummy feeling very full after only eating a little difficulty getting pregnantif your gp practice is closed, phone 111.it can be helpful to keep a note of your period dates and symptoms using a calendar, a diary or an app. you can then discuss this with your doctor who can decide if any tests or treatments might be needed.if you’re seeing your doctor, there are some useful pieces of information to think about beforehand: the first day of your last period (when it started) how many days your period usually lasts what was the shortest time between your periods (from the first day of one period to the first day of the next) what was the longest time between your periods (from the first day of one period to the first day of the next) how often you need to change your period products on a heavy day if you are over 25, when you had your last smear testif your gp thinks you may have an ovarian cyst, you may be referred for anultrasound scan. this is carried out by using a probe placed inside your vagina.as this is a very intimate examination, the doctor who performs it will have another person (chaperone) present. you can ask for a female doctor to carry it out. if there isn’t a female doctor available, you can ask if there’s a female health professional who could carry out the examination.if a cyst is identified during the ultrasound scan, you may need to have this monitored with a repeat ultrasound scan in a few weeks. or your doctor may refer you to a gynaecologist, who specialises in female reproductive health.your doctor may also arrangeblood teststo check for any other conditions.in most cases, ovarian cysts disappear in a few months without treatment. a follow-up ultrasound scan may be used to confirm this.most ovarian cysts do not need treatment or surgery.treatment will depend on: size and appearance of the cysts whether you have any symptoms whether you’repost-menopausal(due to the slightly higher risk ofovarian cancer)if you’re post-menopausal, you’ll usually have regular ultrasound scans and blood tests over the course of a year to monitor the cyst.large cysts, those causing symptoms, and those that could be cancerous, may need to be surgically removed.your care team can talk with you about what to expect, and answer any questions you have.there are 2 types of surgery used to remove ovarian cysts: laparoscopy laparotomythese are usually carried out undergeneral anaesthetic.most cysts can be removed using laparoscopy. this is a type of keyhole surgery. small cuts are made in your tummy and gas is blown into the pelvis to allow the surgeon to access your ovaries.a laparoscopy is a procedure where a camera (a laparoscope) is inserted into the pelvis via a small cut near the belly button so the surgeon can see your internal organs. the surgeon then removes the cyst through the small cuts in your skin.after the cyst has been removed, the cuts will be closed using dissolvable stitches.a laparoscopy is preferred because it causes less pain and has a quicker recovery time. you’ll usually be able to go home on the same day or the following day.if your cyst is particularly large, or there is a chance it could be cancerous, a laparotomy may be recommended.during a laparotomy, a single, larger cut is made in your tummy to give the surgeon better access to the cyst.the whole cyst and ovary may be removed and sent to a laboratory to check whether it’s cancerous. stitches or staples will be used to close the incision.you may need to stay in hospital for a few days after the procedure.after the ovarian cyst has been removed, you’ll feel pain in your tummy. this should improve in a day or two.if you have had a laparoscopy, you’ll probably need to take things easy for 2 weeks. recovery after a laparotomy will usually take longer, possibly around 6 to 8 weeks.if the cyst has been sent for testing, the results should come back in a few weeks. your doctor will discuss with you whether you need any further treatment.contact your gp if you notice the following symptoms after surgery, as they may indicate an infection: heavy bleeding severe pain or swelling in your abdomen a high temperature (fever) dark or smelly vaginal dischargeif you have not been through the menopause, your surgeon will try to preserve as much of your reproductive system as they can.make sure you discuss your fertility concerns with your surgeon before your operation.it’s often possible to just remove the cyst and leave both ovaries intact, which means your fertility should be largely unaffected.if one of your ovaries needs to be removed, the remaining ovary will still release hormones and eggs as usual. your fertility shouldn’t be significantly affected. but you may find it slightly harder to get pregnant.occasionally, it may be necessary to remove both ovaries. this will trigger anearly menopause. you’ll no longer produce any eggs and will not be able to get pregnant.it may still be possible to have a baby by having a donated egg implanted into your womb. you can speak to your doctor for more information about this.if you’ve been through the menopause, both ovaries may be removed because they no longer produce eggs. menopause early and premature menopause women's health rcog:

       " 'Overactive thyroid': 'overactive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body.excess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body’s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as: nervousness andanxiety hyperactivity – where a person can’t stay still and is full of nervous energy unexplained or unplanned weight loss swelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a goitre, to form in the throatthe severity, frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person.read more about thesymptoms of an overactive thyroid glandthe thyroid gland is found in the neck. it produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body’s growth and metabolism. these hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine.they affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going.in hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body’s metabolism.there are several possible underlying causes, the most common being graves’ disease, in which the body’s immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones.read more about thecauses of an overactive thyroid glandan overactive thyroid usually responds well to treatment, and most people are able to control their symptoms.the 3 most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are: thionamides – a group of medications, including carbimazole and methimazole, that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone radioiodine treatment – a radioactive substance called iodine that helps shrink the thyroid gland, reducing its activity (the radiation contained in iodine is a very low dose and does not pose a threat to health) surgery – in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the thyroid gland, particularly if there is a large goitrebeta-blockers may also sometimes be used to temporarily relieve many symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland, although it doesn’t target the thyroid gland itself.it’s common for treatment to lead to the thyroid not producing enough hormones. this is known as having anunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). however, an underactive thyroid is not usually serious and is easily treated.read more about thetreatment of an overactive thyroid glandaround 1 in 20 people with graves’ disease will also develop symptoms affecting their eyes, such as: double vision sensitivity to light (photophobia) tearing (excess production of tears)this is known as graves’ ophthalmopathy and should be seen by a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (an ophthalmologist).a rarer and more serious complication is a sudden and severe flare-up of symptoms, known as a thyroid storm. a thyroid storm can be life-threatening, as it causes severedehydrationand heart problems.read more about thecomplications of an overactive thyroid glandwomen are 10 times more likely to have an overactive thyroid gland than men.in most cases, symptoms will begin somewhere between the ages of 20 and 40, though they can start at any age, including in childhood.an overactive thyroid gland occurs most frequently in white and asian people, and less frequently in african-caribbean people.an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) has many signs and symptoms, although it is unlikely you would develop all of them.if you have hyperthyroidism, you may experience some of the following symptoms: hyperactivity mood swings – such asanxiety, irritability and nervousness difficulty sleeping (insomnia) feeling tired all the time (fatigue) muscle weakness needing to poo or pee more frequently excess fats in your poo – which can make them greasy and difficult to flush down the toilet (steatorrhoea) sensitivity to heat andexcess sweating unexplained or unexpected weight loss – despite having an increased appetite (though in a small number of cases, the increase in appetite can lead to weight gain) very infrequent or light periods, or periods stopping altogether infertility loss of interest in sexif you havediabetes, your diabetic symptoms, such as extreme thirst and tiredness, may be made worse by hyperthyroidism.if you have hyperthyroidism, you may have some of the following physical signs: a swelling in your neck caused by an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre) irregular and/or unusually fast heart rate (palpitations) trembling or shaking (tremor) warm, moist skin redness on the palms of your hands loosening of your nails in their nail beds hives (urticaria) patchy hair loss (alopecia) twitching in your face and limbssee your gp if you are experiencing any of these symptoms. they may not be the result of an overactive thyroid gland, but they will need further investigation.it might be useful to make a list of your symptoms, as this can often be helpful in determining the correct diagnosis.overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones thyroxine or triiodothyronine.overproduction of thyroid hormones can be caused by a number of conditions.graves’ disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid. it can run in families and can occur at any age, although it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years old. you are more likely to develop graves’ disease if you smoke.graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition. this means the immune system mistakes something in the body for a toxic substance and attacks it.in graves’ disease, it attacks the thyroid gland, which leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones.it is not known what triggers the immune system to do this. like many autoimmune conditions, it is thought that a combination of both genetic and environmental factors could be involved.if you have graves’ disease, your eyes may also be affected, causing discomfort and double vision. this is known as graves’ ophthalmopathy. you may find your eyes bulge out or appear more prominent.for more information on graves’ ophthalmopathy, readcomplications of an overactive thyroid gland.it is possible for lumps to develop in your thyroid gland. these are known as nodules. it is not known why nodules develop, but they are usually non-cancerous (benign).however, the nodules can contain abnormal thyroid tissue, which affects the normal production of thyroxine or triiodothyronine, causing an overactive thyroid. nodules that contain abnormal thyroid tissue are described as toxic.toxic thyroid nodules account for about 1 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism.iodine contained in the food you eat is used by your thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. however, taking additional iodine in supplements can cause your thyroid gland to produce too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine.this is known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism – sometimes referred to as jod-basedow phenomenon. it usually only occurs if you already have nodules in your thyroid gland.amiodarone is a type of medication known as an anti-arrhythmic, which helps to control anirregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation). if you have non-toxic nodules in your thyroid gland, taking amiodarone can cause hyperthyroidism because it contains iodine.amiodarone can cause a type of hyperthyroidism usually more severe and difficult to treat through a harmful effect on thyroid tissue. this type of hyperthyroidism is called amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.in rare cases, you may develop an overactive thyroid as a result ofthyroid cancerthat starts in your thyroid follicles. this can occur if cancer cells in your thyroid gland begin to produce thyroxine or triiodothyronine. this is also known as functioning thyroid cancer.see your gp if you think you may have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).a diagnosis will be based on your symptoms and the results ofblood teststhat assess how well your thyroid gland is working. these are known as thyroid function tests.your gp will take a sample of your blood and test it for levels of: thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) thyroxine and triiodothyronine (the thyroid hormones)tsh is made in the pituitary gland in your brain and controls the production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine.when the level of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in your blood are normal, your pituitary gland releases a normal level of tsh. when thyroid hormone production becomes excessive, the pituitary gland stops releasing tsh.when the level of thyroxine or triiodothyronine drops, the pituitary gland produces more tsh to boost it.if you have an overactive thyroid, the thyroid function test will show that levels of tsh in your blood are consistently lower than normal. low levels of tsh mean your thyroid gland is overactive and likely to be making excessive thyroid hormones. this is the first part of the thyroid function test.your gp will then test your blood for levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. if you have an overactive thyroid, you will have higher than normal levels of both these hormones.in some cases, tests may show you have normal thyroid hormone levels, but low or suppressed levels of tsh.this is known a subclinical overactive thyroid gland. if you are diagnosed with subclinical overactive thyroid, you may not need treatment.in most cases, the reduced level of tsh in your blood returns to normal within a couple of months and your subclinical hyperthyroidism will resolve by itself.however, you will need a further thyroid function test so your condition can be monitored.if tests confirm an overactive thyroid gland, you may be referred for further tests to determine the underlying cause.an additional test that may be used is an isotope thyroid scan. this involves swallowing small amounts of a radioactive substance (an isotope), usually technetium, in capsule or liquid form.a scan is then used to measure how much of the isotope has been absorbed by your thyroid gland.if your thyroid gland absorbs a high amount of the isotope, it is likely the underlying cause is either graves’ disease or thyroid nodules.if the amount is low, the underlying cause could be due to: swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), often caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking thyroid tissue or, less commonly, by infection having too much iodine in your diet in rare cases,thyroid cancerif you are diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), your gp will refer you to a specialist in hormonal conditions (endocrinologist) to plan your treatment.thionamides, such as carbimazole and propylthiouracil, are a common treatment. they are a type of medication that stops your thyroid gland producing excess amounts of thyroxine or triiodothyronine.as thionamides affect the production of thyroid hormone rather than their current levels, you will need to take them for several weeks before you notice an improvement (usually between 4 to 8 weeks).once the production of thyroid hormones is under control, your specialist may gradually reduce your medication.you may need to continue taking thionamides for a long time, until the condition is under control.around 1 in 20 people will experience side effects when they first start taking thionamides, such as: itchy skin rash joint painthese side effects should pass once your body is used to the effects of the medication.in rare cases (around 1 in 500), thionamides cause a sudden drop in white blood cells (agranulocytosis), which can make you extremely vulnerable to infection.symptoms of agranulocytosis include: fever gum pain, swelling and bleeding sore throat mouth ulcers persistentcough shortness of breathif you are taking thionamides and you experience any of the symptoms above, phone your gp immediately for advice and an urgent blood test. if this is not possible, phone111or your local out-of-hours service.beta-blockers,such as propranolol or atenolol, can relieve some of the symptoms of an overactive thyroid, including tremor (shaking and trembling), rapid heartbeat and hyperactivity.your specialist may prescribe you a beta-blocker while the condition is being diagnosed, or until thionamide brings your thyroid gland under control. however, beta-blockers are not suitable if you have asthma.beta-blockers can sometimes cause side effects, including: feeling sick feeling tired all the time (fatigue) cold hands and feet trouble sleeping, sometimes with nightmaresradioiodine treatment is a form of radiotherapy used to treat most types of overactive thyroid. radioactive iodine shrinks your thyroid gland, reducing the amount of thyroid hormone it can produce.radioiodine treatment is given either as a drink or a capsule to swallow. the dose of radioactivity in the radioiodine is very low and is not harmful.radioiodine treatment is not suitable if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, and may not be suitable if you have eye problems, such as double vision or prominent (bulging) eyes.women should avoid getting pregnant for at least 6 months after having radioiodine treatment. men should not father a child for at least 4 months after having radioiodine treatment.most people only require a single dose of radioiodine treatment. if a further follow-up dose is required, it is usually given 6 to 12 months after the first dosage.a short course of thionamides treatment may be given a few weeks before radioiodine treatment, as this can lead to a more rapid relief of symptoms.in some cases, a particular treatment may be recommended based on factors such as your age, symptoms and the amount of extra thyroid hormone in your blood. however, there may be circumstances when you are offered a choice between a long-term course of thionamides or radioiodine treatment.both treatments have advantages and disadvantages.advantages of thionamides include: they are straightforward to take and you do not have to go to hospital to take them there is less risk of getting anunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)as a result of treatmentdisadvantages of thionamides include: treatment may not be as successful as radioiodine treatment there is a higher risk of side effectsadvantages of radioiodine treatment include: treatment is usually very successfuldisadvantages of radioiodine treatment include: there is a higher chance of your thyroid gland becoming underactive as a result of treatment radioiodine treatment is usually not suitable for people with additional symptoms affecting their eyes (graves’ ophthalmopathy) women have to avoid getting pregnant for at least 6 months, and men should not father a child for at least 4 months after treatmentyou should discuss the potential risks and benefits of both types of treatment with the specialist in charge of your care.surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland is known as a total or partial thyroidectomy. it is a permanent cure for recurrent overactive thyroid.your specialist may recommend surgery if your thyroid gland is severely swollen (a large goitre) and is causing problems in your neck.other reasons for surgery include: a person cannot be treated with radioiodine treatment as they are pregnant and are unable or unwilling to take thionamides a person has a severe form of graves’ ophthalmopathy the symptoms return (relapse) after a previous successful course of treatment with thionamidesit is normally recommended that the entire thyroid gland is removed, as this means there will be no chance of a relapse.however, you will need to take medication for the rest of your life to compensate for the lack of a functioning thyroid gland – these will be the same medications used totreat an underactive thyroid gland.several complications can occur with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), particularly if the condition is not treated.if you have graves’ disease, you may have problems with your eyes. this is known as graves’ ophthalmopathy and is thought to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the tissues of the eyes. it affects around 1 in 20 people with graves’ disease.symptoms of graves’ ophthalmopathy include: eyes feeling dry and gritty sensitivity to light (photophobia) excessive tearing double vision some loss of vision a feeling of pressure behind the eyesin more severe cases, your eyes can bulge prominently from your eye sockets.if you do develop graves’ ophthalmopathy, you will probably be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for treatment.treatment options include: eyedrops to ease the symptoms sunglasses to protect the eyes against bright lights corticosteroidsto reduce inflammation radiotherapy surgerysome women are pregnant when they are first diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland. becoming pregnant can lead to a relapse of symptoms, especially in someone with a history of graves’ disease.pregnant women with an overactive thyroid are at an increased risk of developing complications during pregnancy and birth, such asmiscarriageandeclampsia.they are also more at risk of going into labour prematurely and having a baby with a low birthweight.pregnant women will need specialist treatment, so the condition should be managed using medications that don’t affect the baby. this is likely to be a medication called propylthiouracil.in many cases, treatment causes the thyroid gland to release levels of hormones that are too low. this is known as having anunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).sometimes this will only be a temporary side effect of treatment, but it can often be permanent.symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland include: being sensitive to cold weight gain constipation depression tirednessan underactive thyroid gland is treated using medications to help replicate the effects of the thyroid hormones.read more about thetreating an underactive thyroid glandan undiagnosed or poorly controlled overactive thyroid can lead to a rare but serious reaction called a thyroid storm. it affects around 1 in 100 people with an overactive thyroid gland.a thyroid storm is a severe and sudden flare-up of symptoms caused by the metabolism going into overdrive, often due to triggers such as: infection pregnancy not taking your medication as directed damage to the thyroid gland, such as a punch to the throatsymptoms of a thyroid storm include: a very rapid heartbeat (over 140 beats a minute) fever (a temperature higher than 38c/100.4f) dehydration,

distinguish the condition from paget’s disease of the bone, which occurs when the normal cycle of bone growth is disrupted, leading to the bones becoming weak and deformed.a similar type ofskin cancercan also occur in other parts of the body.the rest of this section will use the term paget’s disease to refer to paget’s disease of the nipple or breast.paget’s disease usually affects the skin of one nipple and produceseczema-like symptoms, appearing as an itchy, red rash on the nipple that can extend to the darker area of surrounding skin (the areola).it can also appear as a small ulcer or dry, red, flaky patches of skin similar topsoriasis.other possible symptoms include: itchiness or a burning sensation – alongside visible changes to the nipple bleeding from the skin of the nippleif you’re experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and isn’t red, dry or scaly – this is extremely unlikely to be paget’s disease but should still be checked by a doctor.paget’s disease is usually a sign ofbreast cancerin tissue behind the nipple, or breast tissue away from the nipple.the breast cancer can either be: invasive – where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue non-invasive – where the cancerous cells are contained in one or more areas of the breast and are unable to spreadin a small amount of cases, the only evidence of paget’s disease is the nipple changes.in about half of all cases of paget’s disease of the nipple, a lump is found in the breast. the majority of people with a lump will have invasive breast cancer, although this does not necessarily mean it has spread.most people with paget’s disease of the nipple who don’t have a lump will have non-invasive breast cancer.you should visit your gp if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple).as paget’s disease is a form of breast cancer, the sooner it’s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to

specialist breast clinic for tests.when you visit a breast clinic you will have tests to find out whether you have breast cancer and, if you have, what type of breast cancer.staff at the clinic may take photographs of your breasts to record their current appearance and to help identify any further changes that may occur.tests carried out at the clinic may include the following: an examination of your breast to check for lumps or other abnormalities a mammogram (if you are 35 years of age or over) anultrasound scan– which is the first line of investigation used in younger women a skin biopsy will be carried out if paget’s disease is suspecteda mammogram is a simple procedure that usesx-raysto create an image of the inside of your breasts. it can identify early changes in your breast tissue when it may be difficult to feel a lump.younger women often have denser breasts than older women, which can make identifying changes more difficult. therefore, mammograms are not as effective in women under 35 years of age. if you’re under 35, your doctor may suggest you have a breast ultrasound instead.however after a diagnosis of paget’s disease has been confirmed, mammography will become an important part of pre-surgery assessment.during a mammogram, the radiographer will position 1 of your breasts on a flat x-ray plate. a second x-ray plate will press down on your breast from above, so that it is temporarily compressed and flattened between the 2 plates.an x-ray will be taken, which will give a clear image of the inside of your breast. the procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.having a mammogram can be slightly uncomfortable or even painful, but the procedure will only take a few minutes. your doctor will examine the image produced by a mammogram for indications of cancer.if you are under 35 years of age, a breastultrasoundmay be recommended. this is because your breast tissue may be too dense for a mammogram. your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to find out whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. an ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image on a screen. the image will show any lumps or abnormalities present in your breasts.a skinbiopsyis used to diagnose paget’s disease. a biopsy is where a small sample of tissue is taken for examination under a microscope and tests to see if it is cancerous.there are a number of other tests that can be used if a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed and help determine what types of treatment might be used.paget’s disease of the nipple is often associated with other forms of breast cancer.it’s usually treated in the same way as more common types of breast cancer, either by removing the cancerous section of the breast or sometimes by removing the entire breast – a procedure known as a mastectomy.you can discuss any concerns you have with your oncologist (cancer specialist) who will be able to explain each phase of your treatment.if you’re diagnosed with paget’s disease, surgery is often the first form of treatment you will receive. there are 2 main types of surgery. they are: mastectomy – surgery to remove the whole breast, which can be followed by reconstructive surgery to recreate the removed breast breast-conserving surgery – surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour) in your breastthese types of surgery will also involve removing your nipple and the darker area of skin surrounding it (the areola).a mastectomy removes all your breast tissue, including your nipple. you may need to have a mastectomy if: the tumour is large or in the centre of your breast there is more than one area of breast cancer breast-conserving surgery (see below) is not able to provide acceptable resultsif lymph nodes (small glands) are removed from your armpit during a mastectomy, the scarring may block the filtering action of the lymph nodes, resulting in a condition called lymphoedema. this is a long-term condition, but can be treated with: massage compression sleeves – tightly fitting bandages that push excess fluid out of your armlymphoedema can develop months or sometimes years after surgery. see your breast care nurse or gp if you notice any swelling in your arm or hand on the side of your operation.breast-conserving surgery aims to save as much of your breast as possible while removing the cancer with a rim of healthy tissue.if you have paget’s disease, your nipple and areola will be removed. you should be offered reconstructive surgery to improve the appearance of your breast after surgery.if you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue removed will depend on: the size of the tumour in relation to the size of your breast whether the tumour is in one place or scattered throughout your breastyour surgeon will remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer so it can be tested for traces of cancer.if cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, you may need to have more tissue surgically removed from your breast.after having breast-conserving surgery, it’s likely you will need radiation treatment (radiotherapy) to destroy any remaining cancer cells.if you have a mastectomy, you may be able to have reconstructive surgery to recreate your breast. this can be done by: inserting a breast implant using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breastthe reconstruction can be carried out at the time of your mastectomy or at a later stage. you should discuss your options fully with your surgeon and breast nurse before making a decision.for example, it may be possible to have reconstructive surgery after breast-conserving surgery to improve the appearance of your breast and create a nipple.a nipple can be created by: having a nipple tattooed onto the skin using your own body tissue, such as tissue from your other nipple, although around half of these flatten out and shrink over time using a stick-on latex (rubber) nipple, which can be made from a mould of your other nipple so that they are identical; you stick it on every day with glue and it can be removed for washingif you decide not to have breast reconstruction, you can wear a false breast or breast prosthesis, which are available free on the nhs.after having a mastectomy, you may have a temporary, fibre-filled prosthesis and a permanent prosthesis made from silicone, which can be replaced every 2 years.after your surgery, you may need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer, where the cancerous cells have spread into other tissue in your breast.if you had non-invasive breast cancer, where the breast cancer cells were contained in one area of your breast, surgery may be all the treatment you need.other types of treatment for breast cancer include: chemotherapy– cytotoxic medication that prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing is used to destroy cancer cells radiotherapy– where controlled doses of high-energy radiation, usuallyx-rays, are used to destroy cancer cells biological therapy – if your breast cancer is her2 positive, biological therapy, usually a medication called trastuzumab, can be used to treat the cancer by stopping the effects of her2 and helping your immune system fight off cancer cells hormone therapy – if your breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive, hormone therapy can be used to treat the cancer by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or stopping their effectsa number of factors can help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer, including paget’s disease of the nipple.exercising regularlyand eating ahealthy, balanced dietare known to help prevent many forms of cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, such asheart diseaseanddiabetes.studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions at the moment, there are benefits for women who maintain ahealthy weight, do regular exercise and who have a low intake ofsaturated fatandalcohol.it has been suggested that exercising regularly (a minimum of 150 minutes or 2 hours 30 minutes a week) can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by up to a third.if you have been through themenopause(when your monthly periods stop), it’s particularly important you are not overweight or obese. this is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.studies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don’t.the reasons are not fully understood, but it could be because women don’t ovulate as regularly while they are breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.in june 2013, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) announced that two medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the nhs for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.either tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who have been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven’t.these medications may not be suitable if in the past you have had blood clots orwomb cancer, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future. women who have already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts won’t be offered these medications because their risk of developing breast cancer is so small.a course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.raloxifene can cause side effects including flu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your periods and nausea and vomiting.your chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increases while you’re taking tamoxifen, so you’ll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. the medication can also increase your risk of blood clots so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before any planned surgery.currently, these 2 medications are not licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased risk of developing the condition. however, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.breast screening can pick up breast cancer before it forms a lump. the procedure uses mammograms, wherex-raysare taken, to create an image of the inside of your breasts.the nhs breast screening programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the uk who are 50 years of age or over. the nhs has recently extended the breast screening age range so that all women who are 47 to 73 years of age will be eligible for breast screening.nhs breast screening is not usually available for women under 47 years of age. this is because younger women tend to have denser breast tissue which makes mammograms less effective at identifying abnormalities.speak to your gp if you are below screening age, worried about changes in your breasts, or have a family history of breast cancer.read more information aboutbreast cancer screening. mastectomy get checked early:

       " 'Pancreatic cancer': 'pancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas – a large gland that’s part of the digestive system.around half of all new cases are diagnosed in people aged 75 or over. it’s uncommon in people under 40 years of age.in the early stages, a tumour in the pancreas doesn’t usually cause any symptoms, which can make it difficult to diagnose.it’s important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren’t usually the result of cancer. but you should contact your gp if you’re concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly.the first noticeable symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often: pain in the back or stomach area – which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you’ve eaten unexpected weight loss jaundice – the most obvious sign is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes; it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-colouredother possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: nausea and vomiting bowel changes fever and shivering indigestion blood clotsyou may also develop symptoms ofdiabetesif you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.there are also a number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces.it’s not fully understood what causes pancreatic cancer, but a number of risk factors for developing the condition have been identified.risk factors for pancreatic cancer include: age – it mainly affects people who are 50 to 80 years of age smoking– around 1 in 3 cases is associated with using cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco having a history of certain health conditions – such asdiabetes,chronic pancreatitis(long-term inflammation of the pancreas),stomach ulcerand helicobacter pylori infection (a stomach infection)in about 1 in 10 cases, pancreatic cancer is inherited from a person’s parents. certain genes also increase your chances of getting pancreatitis, which in turn increases your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas.cancer research ukhas more information onrisk factors and causeson their websiteyour gp will first ask about your general health and carry out a physical examination. they may examine your tummy (abdomen) for a lump and to see whether your liver is enlarged.they’ll also check your skin and eyes for signs of jaundice and may request a urine sample andblood test.if your gp suspects pancreatic cancer, you’ll usually be referred to a specialist at a hospital for further investigation. you may have either: anultrasound scan acomputerised tomography (ct) scan amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan a positron emission tomography (pet) scan – where you’re given an injection of a very small amount of radioactive medication, known as a tracer, which helps to show up cancers in an imagedepending on the results of a scan, further tests may include: an endoluminal ultrasonography (eus) endoscopy – a type of endoscopy which allows close-up ultrasound pictures to be taken of your pancreas an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) – a type of endoscopy which is used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts; the dye will show up on anx-rayand highlight any tumours a laparoscopy – a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to see inside your body using a laparoscopy (a thin, flexible microscope)abiopsy, where a small sample is taken from a suspected tumour, may also be carried out during these procedures.in 2015, thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.cancer of the pancreas is difficult to treat. it rarely causes any symptoms in the early stages, so it’s often not detected until the cancer is fairly advanced. if the tumour is large, treating the cancer will be more difficult.if you’ve been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, your treatment will depend on the type and location of your cancer, and how far it’s advanced. your age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration.the first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells. if this isn’t possible, treatment will focus on preventing the tumour growing and causing further harm to your body.the 3 main treatments for pancreatic cancer are: surgery chemotherapy radiotherapysome types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require 2 types of treatment or a combination of all 3.read more abouttreating pancreatic cancer.recovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process.you’ll probably experience some pain after your operation. the staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief.after any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. this means you won’t be able to eat or drink straight away.you’ll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. you may be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation.after the tumour has been removed, you’ll probably have a six-month course ofchemotherapy, which greatly increases your chance of being cured. but because cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don’t recover completely.treatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth.treatment for pancreatic cancer depends on the type, location and stage of your cancer (how far it’s spread).your age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration when deciding on your treatment plan.the first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body.if this isn’t possible, the focus will be on preventing the tumour growing and causing further harm.sometimes it’s not possible to get rid of the cancer or slow it down, so treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.cancer of the pancreas is very difficult to treat. in its early stages, this type of cancer rarely causes symptoms, so it’s often not detected until it’s quite advanced. if the tumour is large or has spread, treating or curing the cancer is much harder.deciding what treatment is best for you can be a difficult process. there’s a lot to take in, so it’s important to talk about the possible alternatives with a family member or friend.you should also have an in-depth discussion with your doctor, who can tell you the pros and cons of the treatments available to you.if at any stage you don’t understand the treatment options being explained to you, make sure you ask your doctor for more details.there are 3 main ways that cancer of the pancreas can be treated: surgery chemotherapy radiotherapysome types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require 2 or a combination of all 3.cancer research uk has more information abouttypes of treatment for pancreatic cancer.surgery is usually the only way pancreatic cancer can be completely cured. however, as the condition is usually advanced by the time it’s diagnosed, surgery is only suitable for around 15 to 20% of people.however, this isn’t a suitable option if your tumour has wrapped itself around important blood vessels. if your cancer has spread to other areas of the body, surgically removing the tumour won’t cure you.surgery for pancreatic cancer is usually only an option for people who have a good general level of health. this is because pancreas surgery is often long and complex, and the recovery process can be slow.sometimes the risks of surgery can outweigh the potential benefits.your doctor will discuss with you whether surgery is a suitable option.the whipple procedure is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer, and involves removing the head of the pancreas.your surgeon must also remove the first part of your small intestine (bowel), your gall bladder (which stores bile) and part of your bile duct. sometimes, part of the stomach also has to be removed.the end of the bile duct and the remaining part of your pancreas is connected to your small intestine. this allows bile and the hormones and enzymes produced by the pancreas to still be released into your system.after this type of surgery, about one in three people need to take enzymes to help them digest food.the whipple procedure involves long and intensive surgery, but it’s easier to recover from than a total pancreatectomy.a distal pancreatectomy involves removing the tail and body of your pancreas.your spleen will usually also be removed at the same time. part of your stomach, bowel, left adrenal gland, left kidney and left diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen) may also be removed.like the whipple procedure, a distal pancreatectomy is a long and complex operation that won’t be carried out unless your doctor thinks it’s necessary.during a total pancreatectomy, your entire pancreas will be removed. this is sometimes necessary due to the position of the tumour.your surgeon will also remove your: bile duct gall bladder spleen part of your small intestine part of your stomach (sometimes) surrounding lymph nodes (part of the immune system)after a total pancreatectomy, you’ll need to take enzymes to help your digestive system digest food. you’ll also havediabetesfor the rest of your life because the pancreas produces insulin – the hormone that regulates blood sugar.removing your spleen can increase your risk of developing infections and may also affect your blood’s ability to clot. this means you’ll be on penicillin (or an alternative antibiotic if you’re allergic to it) for the rest of your life, and you’ll need to have regular vaccinations.sometimes, you may need to take tablets for a short period to stop the platelets in your blood sticking to each other. platelets are a type of blood cell that cause your blood to clot (thicken).although surgery may not be a suitable way of removing your tumour, you may be offered it to help ease your symptoms.this type of surgery won’t cure your cancer, but will mean that your condition is easier to manage, and it will make you more comfortable.to help control jaundice, a stent can be placed in your bile duct using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). this will help keep the bile duct open and prevent bilirubin – the yellow chemical in bile – from building up and causing jaundice.if a stent isn’t a suitable option for you, you may need an operation to bypass your blocked bile duct. your surgeon will cut the bile duct just above the blockage and reconnect it to your intestine, which allows your bile to drain away.these types of surgery are much less intensive than surgery carried out on the pancreas. the recovery time is much quicker, and people find that their jaundice improves significantly.chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses anti-cancer medicines to either kill the cancerous (malignant) cells in your body or stop them multiplying.chemotherapy treatment is often used alongside surgery and radiotherapy (see below) to help ensure that as much of the cancer is treated as possible.chemotherapy may be given: before surgery – to try to shrink the cancer, so there’s a greater chance of the surgeon being able to remove all of the cancer after surgery – to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back when surgery isn’t possible – to try to shrink the cancer, slow its growth and relieve your symptomssome chemotherapy medicines can be taken orally (by mouth), but some need to be given directly into a vein (intravenously).chemotherapy also attacks normal, healthy cells, which is why this type of treatment can have many side effects. the most common side effects include: vomiting nausea mouth sores fatigue increased risk of infectionthese are usually only temporary, and should improve once you’ve completed your treatment.the chemotherapy medications can also be used in combination, so your doctor may suggest using one medication or a combination of 2 or 3.combining chemotherapy medications can give a better chance of shrinking or controlling the cancer, but increases the chance of side effects. sometimes, the risks of chemotherapy can outweigh the potential benefits.read more aboutchemotherapyradiotherapy is a form of cancer therapy that uses high-energy beams ofradiationto help shrink your tumour and relieve pain.side effects of radiotherapy can include: fatigue skin rashes loss of appetite diarrhoea nausea or vomitingthese side effects are usually only temporary, and should improve after your treatment has been completed.read more aboutradiotherapyin its early stages, pancreatic cancer rarely causes symptoms.the pancreas is actually 2 glands in one, and symptoms depend on which part is affected. this is because: the exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which break down food so they can be absorbed by your body the endocrine pancreas produces hormones – including insulin, which keeps your blood sugar levels stablemost cases of pancreatic cancer are in the exocrine pancreas, and the 3 most common symptoms are: pain in the stomach or back jaundice weight lossit’s important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different health conditions and aren’t usually the result of cancer. however, you should contact your gp if you’re concerned, or if you suddenly develop these symptoms.pancreatic cancer can cause a dull pain in your upper tummy (abdomen), which may spread to your back.to begin with, the pain may come and go, but as the tumour becomes larger and more advanced, the pain may be more constant and last longer.the pain is often worse when you lie down or after you’ve eaten. you may also have pain or tenderness in your abdomen if your liver, pancreas or gallbladder are enlarged.many types of cancer cause weight loss, because the cancerous cells deprive your healthy cells of the nutrients they need.pancreatic cancer is more likely to cause weight loss than some other cancers because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which help food to be absorbed into your body.if a tumour disrupts that production, your body will find it harder to digest food, particularly high-fat foods.this can cause you to lose weight and become malnourished.jaundice is caused by a build-up of a yellowish-brown substance called bilirubin in the blood and tissues of the body.the most obvious sign of jaundice is yellow skin and yellowing of the whites of the eyes. it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured.bilirubin is a waste product produced by the liver, and passed out of the body through the bile duct and into the intestine.jaundice is more often a sign of conditions such asgallstonesorhepatitisthan it is of cancer.however, a tumour can sometimes develop in the head of the pancreas and block the bile duct, causing bilirubin to build up in the body.the pancreas produces the hormone insulin. without it, the body can’t move glucose (sugar) out of the blood and into your cells.the main symptoms of diabetes include: excessive thirst urinating frequently – particularly at night extreme tiredness weight loss and loss of muscle bulkyou may developdiabetesif you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.other possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: itching (if you have jaundice) nausea and vomiting bowel changes fever and shivering indigestion blood clotsendocrine pancreatic tumours, also known as neuroendocrine tumours, are uncommon.there are a number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces.the exact cause of pancreatic cancer isn’t fully understood. however, there are a number of risk factors that can increase your chances of developing it.pancreatic cancer can affect people of any age, but it mainly affects people who are aged 50 to 80. almost 50% of people diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas are aged 75 or over.research has found that about one in three cases of pancreatic cancer is associated withsmokingand other tobacco use.smoking cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco can all increase your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas.this is because tobacco smoke contains harmful chemicals and toxins that can cause irritation and inflammation within your body’s organs and tissues.if you havediabetes, your risk of developing pancreatic cancer is thought to be increased.however, it’s important to remember that diabetes is very common and most people with diabetes won’t develop pancreatic cancer.as well as diabetes being a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, it’s also thought that a cancerous tumour that grows in the pancreas could be responsible for some cases of diabetes.chronic pancreatitis(long-term inflammation of the pancreas) increases your risk of getting pancreatic cancer, but isn’t responsible for many cases. chronic pancreatitis is often caused by long-termalcohol misuse.although it’s a very rare condition, if you have hereditary pancreatitis, your risk of developing pancreatic cancer is 50 times greater than the rest of the population.helicobacter pylori are bacteria that cause stomach ulcers, and is a known risk factor for stomach cancer.research has shown that a helicobacter pylori infection may slightly increase your risk of getting pancreatic cancer. however, the risk is thought to be small because most people with this infection don’t get cancer of the pancreas.there are also a number of other factors that have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. these are: long-termhepatitis tooth orgum disease heavy alcohol use a previous history of certain types ofcancer previously havingradiotherapy diet,weightand level ofphysical activitythecancer research ukwebsite has more information about theseother possible risk factors for pancreatic cancer.in the early stages, pancreatic cancer often causes no symptoms. this can make it difficult to diagnose.if you visit your gp withsymptoms of pancreatic cancer, they will probably examine your eyes and skin for signs of jaundice.they may also test your urine for bile, or carry out ablood test. this is because jaundice can sometimes be a sign of pancreatic cancer.your gp may also examine your tummy (abdomen) to feel for any swelling or abnormality. the pancreas is quite well-hidden within the body because it’s covered by part of the bowel. this can make it difficult to feel for tumours during a physical examination.if your gp suspects pancreatic cancer, you’ll be referred for further testing at a hospital.in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.anultrasound scanis a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your body.if pancreatic cancer is suspected, you’ll be referred for an ultrasound scan of your abdomen to see if your pancreas appears abnormal.however, this type of scan can often miss pancreatic cancer, because ultrasound waves aren’t very good at penetrating deep into body tissues.acomputerised tomography (ct) scanproduces a detailed image of the inside of your body using a series ofx-rayimages.your doctor can use the results of a ct scan to check for abnormalities and assess the size of the tumour.amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanalso produces an image of the inside of your body, but it uses strong magnetic and radio waves instead of x-rays.mri scans are carried out in a tube-shaped mri scanner. it’s a noisy procedure that can feel claustrophobic. it also takes longer than other types of scans.like a ct scan, an mri scan allows your doctor to check for signs ofcancerin other parts of the body.a positron emission tomography (pet) scan can help to show where the cancer is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.before the scan, you’ll be given an injection of a very small amount of a radioactive medication, known as a tracer. the amount of radiation is very small and no more than you would receive from a normal x-ray.the most common tracer used is a radioactive form of glucose (sugar). you’ll then rest for about an hour to allow the tracer to travel to areas in your body where glucose is used for energy.the scan itself can take up to an hour and produces an image of the tracer in your body. the tracer shows up cancers because they use glucose in a different way to normal tissue.if a small shadow is seen on a ct or mri scan but it’s not obvious what it is, another test called endoluminal ultrasonography (eus) can be carried out.during eus, a thin, flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach.an ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope will then be used to take close-up pictures of your pancreas.before the procedure, you may be given a sedative to help you relax. eus can also be used to take abiopsyfor further examination.endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) is a procedure used to insert a plastic tube or stent into the bile duct if someone has jaundice.during ercp, an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. the endoscope can then be used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts.after the dye has been injected, an x-ray will be taken. the dye will show up on the x-ray and will highlight any tumour that’s blocking the bile and pancreatic ducts.during the procedure, tissue samples may be taken. these samples can be looked at under a microscope to see whether the cells are cancerous.ercp can take 30 to 60 minutes. as with eus, you’ll usually be given a sedative to help you relax.a laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen and pelvis.during the procedure, a small incision will be made in your abdomen, and a laparoscope (a thin, flexible microscope) will be inserted.this will allow the surgeon to see inside your body and make sure the tumour hasn’t spread before recommending its removal.this procedure will be carried out under ageneral anaesthetic(where you’re put to sleep so you don’t feel any pain or discomfort).abiopsyinvolves taking a sample from a suspected tumour, which can then be tested to see if it’s cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).a biopsy can be carried out during an eus, ercp or laparoscopy using a small instrument attached to the endoscope to collect a number of cells.it’s also possible for a biopsy to be carried out using a long, thin needle that’s passed through your abdomen. the needle will be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound or ct scan.recovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process.you’ll probably experience some pain after your operation. the staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief.after any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. this means you won’t be able to eat or drink straight away.you’ll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. you may be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation.after the tumour has been removed, you will probably have a 6-month course ofchemotherapy, which greatly increases your chance of being cured. however, as cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don’t recover completely.treatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth. brain, nerves and spinal cord chronic pancreatitis cancer research uk: pancreatic

       " 'Panic disorder': 'panic disorder is where you have recurring and regular panic attacks, often for no apparent reason.everyone experiences feelings of anxiety and panic at certain times during their lifetime. it’s a natural response to stressful or dangerous situations.however, for someone with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time.anxiety is a feeling of unease. it can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. there are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including phobias– an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal generalised anxiety disorder (gad) – a long-term condition that causes excessive anxiety and worry relating to a variety of situations post-traumatic stress disorder – a condition with psychological and physical symptoms caused by distressing or frightening eventsa panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms.you may experience an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. as well as these feelings, you may also have physical symptoms such as: nausea sweating trembling a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)the number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. some people may have one or two attacks each month, while others may have several attacks a week.read more about thesymptoms of panic disorder.panic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they’re not dangerous. an attack won’t cause you any physical harm, and it’s unlikely that you’ll be admitted to hospital if you’ve had a panic attack.as with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn’t fully understood.however, it’s thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors.read about the possiblecauses of panic disorder.it’s important to be aware that some physical conditions and disorders can have similar symptoms to those of anxiety. for example: mitral valve prolapse postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (pots) anaemia paroxysmal atrial tachycardia – episodes of rapid and regular heartbeats that begin and end abruptly thyrotoxicosis – where large amounts of thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing rapid heartbeat,sweating, tremor and anxiety poorly controlleddiabetes adrenal tumours – growths that develop on the adrenal glands (two triangular-shaped glands that form part of the kidneys) carcinoid syndrome – a set of symptoms caused by some carcinoid tumours that can develop in the cells of the endocrine system (glands that produce and secrete hormones) zollinger-ellison syndrome – causes overproduction of insulin and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)see your gp if you have symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder (see above).you may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.read more abouthow panic disorder is diagnosed.the aim of treating

vehicle licensing agency (dvla)about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability.gov.uk has further information and advice aboutdriving with a disability or health condition.panic disorder is treatable, but to make a full recovery it’s important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it’s given at an early stage.left untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. it can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or otherphobias.agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong.read more about thecomplications of panic disorder.the symptoms of a panic attack can be very frightening and distressing.symptoms tend to occur suddenly, without warning and often for no apparent reason.as well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can also cause a variety of other symptoms, including: a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations) sweating trembling hot flushes chills shortness of breath a choking sensation chest pain nausea dizziness feeling faint numbness or pins and needles dry mouth a need to go to the toilet ringing in your ears a feeling of dread or a fear of dying a churning stomach a tingling sensation in your fingers shivering shakingthe physical symptoms of a panic attack are unpleasant, and they can also be accompanied by thoughts of fear and terror.for this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which creates a cycle of living in ‘fear of fear’ and adds to the sense of panic.sometimes, the symptoms of a panic attack can be so intense they can make you feel like you’re having aheart attack.however, it’s important to be aware that symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath won’t result in you having a heart attack. although panic attacks can often be frightening, they don’t cause any physical harm. people who have had panic disorder for some time usually learn to recognise this ‘heart attack sensation’ and become more aware of how to control their symptoms.most panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes. some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. however, it’s likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack.people with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week.people with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. the panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable.if you have panic disorder, you may also feel anxious about when your next attack will be.during a panic attack your symptoms can be so intense and out of your control that you can feel detached from the situation, your body and your surroundings. it can almost feel as if you’re an observer, making the situation seem very unreal.this sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. being detached from the situation doesn’t provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating.as with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn’t fully understood.it’s thought that panic disorder is probably caused by a combination of physical and psychological factors. some of these factors are outlined below.a trauma, such asbereavement, can sometimes trigger feelings of panic and anxiety. these feelings may be obvious soon after the event or they may be triggered unexpectedly years later.having a close family member with panic disorder is thought to increase a person’s risk of developing it. however, the precise nature of the risk isn’t known.neurotransmitters are chemicals that occur naturally in the brain. it’s thought that an imbalance of these chemicals may increase your risk of developing conditions such as panic disorder.some experts believe that panic disorder is linked to an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide. breathing in air with high carbon dioxide levels can bring on panic attacks, and breathing techniques can help to relieve or stop panic attacks.another theory is that people who experience panic attacks tend to focus on minor physical symptoms and interpret them in a catastrophic way. this triggers a nervous system response that causes the panic attack.everyone who has panic disorder will experience panic attacks.however, not everyone who has panic attacks is diagnosed with panic disorder.some people have panic attacks in response to specific situations. for example, they may have a phobia (overwhelming fear) of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) and have a panic attack when faced with an enclosed space.while most people withphobiasonly experience panic attacks when faced with the thing that triggers their fear, the panic attacks of people with panic disorder usually occur without warning and for no obvious reason.this means that panic disorder will only be diagnosed after experiencing recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, and if the attacks are followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.your gp will ask you to describe the symptoms you’ve been experiencing. they’ll also ask you how often your symptoms occur and in what situations.it’s important to tell your gp about how you’ve been feeling and how your symptoms have affected you.although it can sometimes be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life, try not to feel anxious or embarrassed.your gp needs to gain a good understanding of your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment for you.your gp may also want to carry out a physical examination to look for signs of any physical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.for example, anoveractive thyroidgland (hyperthyroidism) can sometimes cause similar symptoms to a panic attack.by ruling out any underlying medical conditions, your gp will be able to make the correct diagnosis.the main aim in treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks and ease the severity of symptoms.psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.depending on your individual circumstances, you may need one of these treatment types or a combination of the two.if you’re offered psychological therapy, it will probably be in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt). if this doesn’t work, medication may be recommended.before starting any form of treatment, your gp will discuss all of the options with you, outlining the advantages of each type and making you aware of any possible risks or side effects.no single treatment works for everyone and you may need to try a number of treatments before finding one that works for you. the treatment that’s recommended will depend on your general level of health, the severity of your condition and your personal preferences.it’s important you understand what your treatment will involve. if you don’t understand something your gp has told you, ask them to explain it in more detail.psychological therapy has proven long-term benefits and it’s recommended for treating panic disorder. it will usually take the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt).cbt is thought to be one of the most effective psychological treatments for panic disorder. it involves having regular sessions with a therapist.the therapist may discuss with you how you react when you have a panic attack and what you think about when you’re experiencing an attack.once you and your therapist have identified any negative thoughts and beliefs, you can work on replacing them with more realistic and balanced ones. your therapist can also teach you ways of changing your behaviour, making it easier for you to deal with future panic attacks.for example, they may be able to show you breathing techniques that can be used to help keep you calm during a panic attack.thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)recommends a total of seven to 14 hours of cbt to be completed within a four month period. treatment will usually involve having a weekly one to two hour session.nice also recommends that in certain situations a shorter programme of cbt may be appropriate. this can involve a reduced number of hours of cbt with ‘homework’ being set between sessions so that you can practice what you’ve learnt after each session.you should visit your gp regularly while you’re having cbt so that they can assess your progress and see how you’re doing.support groups can provide useful information and advice about how you can effectively manage your panic disorder. they’re also a good way of meeting other people who’ve had similar experiences of the condition.panic attacks can sometimes be frightening and isolating, so it can be helpful to know that other people are experiencing the same feelings and emotions as you.anxiety ukandtriumph over phobia (top uk)are uk-based charities that provide information and support for people with anxiety disorders.support groups often involve face-to-face meetings where you can talk about your problems and difficulties with others. many can also provide support and guidance over the telephone or in writing.ask your gp about support groups for panic disorder near you. you can also use the services directory tofind anxiety services in your area.antidepressantsare often associated withdepression, but they can also be used to treat a number of other psychological conditions.antidepressants can take two to four weeks before becoming effective. it’s therefore important to continue taking them, even if you feel they’re not working. you should only ever stop taking prescribed medication if your gp specifically advises you to do so.selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)and tricyclic antidepressants are two types of antidepressants that are often recommended for treating panic disorder.when starting a new type of medication, you should be regularly assessed by your gp at two, four, six and 12 week intervals. this will allow you to discuss any issues that you have with your medication, and enables your gp to assess which treatment is most effective. it will also provide you with the opportunity to try a different type of medication if you want to.selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain.they’re the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant for treating panic disorder. they’re usually started at a low dose before gradually being increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.common side effects of ssris include: nausea headaches low sex drive (loss of libido) blurred vision diarrhoeaorconstipation dizziness dry mouth loss of appetite sweating feeling agitated insomnia(sleep problems) abdominal painwhen you first start taking ssris, your feelings of anxiety and panic may get slightly worse. in most cases, this is temporary and your symptoms will start to return to normal levels within a few days of taking the medicine.speak to your gp if you feel that your symptoms have got worse and that they’re not showing signs of returning to normal levels after a few days.after you start to take a ssri, you should visit your gp after two, four, six, and 12 weeks so that they can check on your progress and see whether you’re responding to the medicine. not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it’s important that your progress is carefully monitored.if your gp feels it necessary, you may require regularblood testsor blood pressure checks when taking antidepressants. if after 12 weeks of taking the medication you don’t show any signs of improvement, your gp may prescribe an alternative ssri to see if it has any effect.the length of time that you’ll have to take a ssri for will vary depending on how well you respond to the treatment. even if you feel that your panic disorder has been successfully treated, it’s likely that you’ll need to keep taking the medication for at least six to 12 months.if you stop taking your medication before this time, the risk of your symptoms recurring may be increased. some people may have to take ssris for longer than the usual six to 12 month period.when you and your gp decide that it’s appropriate for you to stop taking ssris, you will gradually be weaned off them by slowly reducing your dosage. as with antidepressants, you should never stop taking ssris unless your gp specifically advises you to.stopping your medication straight away without being weaned off, or without seeking advice from your gp, may result in withdrawal symptoms such as: dizziness numbness and tingling nausea and vomiting headache anxiety sleep disturbances sweatingthese symptoms can also occur if you miss a dose of medication, or if your dose is reduced. the symptoms are usually mild, but they can be severe if the medication is stopped suddenly.for some people, this means having to take ssris on a long-term basis. for others, a course of cbt can help to reduce the risk of their symptoms recurring.contact your gp if you experience troublesome side effects that don’t ease.if ssris aren’t suitable, or if your symptoms don’t improve after a 12 week course of ssris, your gp may try prescribing a different type of antidepressant.tricyclic antidepressants work in a similar way to ssris. they regulate the levels of the chemicals noradrenaline and serotonin in your brain, which has a positive effect on your feelings and mood.imipramine and clomipramine are two tricyclic antidepressants that are often prescribed to treat panic disorder. tricyclic antidepressants aren’t addictive.ssris are usually prescribed before tricyclic antidepressants because they have fewer side effects. common side effects of tricyclic antidepressants include: constipation difficulty urinating blurred vision dry mouth weight gain or weight loss drowsiness sweating lightheadedness skin rashthe side effects should ease after seven to 10 days as your body starts to get used to the medication. however, see your gp if they become troublesome and don’t ease.pregabalin is another medication that’s often used to treat panic disorder. it’s an anticonvulsant that’s also used to treatepilepsy(a condition that causes repeated seizures). however, it’s also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety.side effects of pregabalin can include: drowsiness dizziness increased appetite and weight gain blurred vision headaches dry mouth vertigo– the sensation that you, or the environment around you, are moving or spinningpregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than ssris.clonazepam is another medication that’s often used to treat epilepsy and is also sometimes prescribed for panic disorder.it can cause a wide variety of side effects including lethargy (lack of energy), abnormal eye movement (nystagmus), confusion and allergic reactions.you may be referred to a mental health specialist if treatments such as attending a support group, cbt and medication don’t improve yoursymptoms of panic disorder.a mental health specialist will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. they’ll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it. they may also ask you about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends.the specialist will be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to effectively treat your symptoms. the type of mental health specialist that you’ll be referred to will depend on your individual situation. for example, you may be referred to a: psychiatrist – a trained medical doctor who specialises in mental health; a psychiatrist is one of the only mental health specialists who is able to prescribe medication clinical psychologist – who is trained in the scientific study of human behaviour and mental processes and focuses solely on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; a clinical psychologist will help you to find ways of effectively managing your anxiety and panic attacksthere are several self-help techniques you can use to help treat the symptoms of panic disorder yourself.some of these techniques are listed below.if possible, you should stay where you are during a panic attack. the attack could last up to an hour, so you may need to pull over and park where it’s safe to do so if you’re driving.if you have a panic attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations will eventually pass.during an attack, try to focus on something that’s non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket.while you’re having a panic attack, try to focus on your breathing. feelings of panic andanxietycan get worse if you breathe too quickly. try breathing slowly and deeply while counting to three on each breath in and out.when you have a panic attack, try to identify what it is you fear and challenge it. you can achieve this by constantly reminding yourself that what you fear isn’t real and that it will pass in a few minutes.many things can go through your mind during a panic attack – for example, some people think about disaster or death. instead of focusing on negative thoughts, try to concentrate on positive images.think of a place or a situation that makes you feel peaceful, relaxed or at ease. once you have this image in your mind, try to focus your attention on it. it should help distract you from the situation and may also help ease your symptoms.thinking positively can be difficult, particularly if you’ve got used to thinking negatively over a long period of time. creative visualisation is a technique that requires practice, but you may gradually notice positive changes in the way you think about yourself and others.fighting a panic attack can often make it worse. trying to resist the attack and finding you’re unable to can increase your sense of anxiety and panic.instead, during a panic attack, reassure yourself by accepting that although it may seem embarrassing, and your symptoms may be difficult to deal with, the attack isn’t life-threatening. focus on the fact that the attack will evetually end and try your best to let it pass.if you have panic disorder, you may feel constantly stressed and anxious, particularly about when your next panic attack may be. learning to relax can help to relieve some of this tension, and it may also help you to deal more effectively with your panic attacks when they occur.some people find complementary therapies, such as massage and aromatherapy, help them to relax. activities, such asyoga and pilates, can also be helpful. you can also practise breathing and relaxation techniques, which you can use during a panic attack to help ease your symptoms.regular exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, will help reduce stress and release tension. it can also encourage your brain to release the chemical serotonin, which can help improve your mood.it’s recommended that adults aged 19-64 years should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such ascyclingor fastwalking, every week.they should also domuscle-strengthening activitieson two or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).visit your gp for a fitness assessment before starting a new exercise programme if you haven’t exercised before or for a long time.read more about thephysical activity guidelines for adults.unstable blood sugar levels can contribute to thesymptoms of a panic attack. therefore, you should maintain ahealthy, balanced diet, eat regularly and avoid eating sugary food and drinks. also, avoid caffeine,alcoholand smoking because they can all contribute to panic attacks.panic disorder is a treatable condition, but to make a full recovery it’s very important you seek medical help as soon as possible.this is because treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it’s given at an early stage.left undiagnosed and untreated, panic disorder can become a debilitating and isolating illness. it can also increase your risk of developing other psychological conditions.agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong.if you have agoraphobia, leaving home, going out in public and travelling alone can cause intense anxiety. many people with agoraphobia avoid everyday activities because of their phobia.agoraphobia is one of the conditions that can develop alongside panic disorder. people with panic disorder can develop agoraphobia because of their fear of having a panic attack in a public place.you may worry that a panic attack in a public place will be embarrassing, or that you’ll have difficulty getting help if you need it. you may also worry about public places that you would have difficulty leaving, such as a train, if you were to have a panic attack.if you have agoraphobia, you may find it difficult to leave the house, particularly if you’re not with a trusted family member or a friend.if you have panic disorder, you may also develop otherfears and phobias, which can often seem irrational. for example, you may start to worry about a particular object or action that triggers your attacks and become fearful of those things.panic disorder is more common in teenagers than in younger children.panic attacks can be particularly debilitating for children and young people. severe panic disorder may affect their development and learning. the fear of having a panic attack may stop children from going to school and engaging in a social life. they may also find it difficult to concentrate on their schoolwork.diagnosing panic disorderin children is usually a case of taking a detailed medical history and carrying out a thorough physical examination to rule out any physical causes for the symptoms.screening for other anxiety disorders may also be needed to help determine what’s causing your child’s panic attacks.panic attacks in children are often dramatic events, including screaming and crying and an increased breathing rate (hyperventilation).if your child displays the signs and symptoms of panic disorder over a prolonged period of time, your gp may refer them to a specialist for further assessment and treatment.the specialist may recommend a course ofpsychotherapyfor your child, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt).some studies have shown that conditions that cause intense anxiety, such as panic disorder, can also increase your risk of developing an alcohol or drug problem.the side effects or withdrawal symptoms of both prescribed medication and illegal drugs can increase thesymptoms of anxiety.smoking and caffeine can also make your anxiety symptoms worse, so you should try togive up smoking(if you smoke) and limit the amount of caffeine in your diet.

the more common symptoms are described below.however, the order in which these develop and their severity is different for each individual. it’s unlikely that a person with parkinson’s disease would experience all or most of these.the three main symptoms of parkinson’s disease affect physical movement: tremor – shaking, which usually begins in the hand or arm and is more likely to occur when the limb is relaxed and resting slowness of movement (bradykinesia) – where physical movements are much slower than normal, which can make everyday tasks difficult and can result in a distinctive slow, shuffling walk with very small steps muscle stiffness (rigidity) – stiffness and tension in the muscles, which can make it difficult to move around and make facial expressions, and can result in painful muscle cramps (dystonia)these main symptoms are sometimes referred to by doctors as parkinsonism as there can be causes other than parkinson’s disease.parkinson’s disease can also cause a range of other physical and mental symptoms. balance problems – these can make someone with the condition more likely to have afalland injure themselves loss of sense of smell (anosmia) – sometimes occurs several years before other symptoms develop nerve pain – can cause unpleasant sensations, such as burning, coldness or numbness problems with urination – such as having to get up frequently

refer you to a specialist for further tests.read more aboutdiagnosing parkinson’s diseaseparkinson’s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra.nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. dopamine acts as a messenger between the parts of the brain and nervous system that help control and co-ordinate body movements.if these nerve cells die or become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. this means the part of the brain controlling movement can’t work as well as normal, causing movements to become slow and abnormal.the loss of nerve cells is a slow process. the symptoms of parkinson’s disease usually only start to develop when around 80% of the nerve cells in the substantia nigra have been lost.it’s not known why the loss of nerve cells associated with parkinson’s disease occurs, although research is ongoing to identify potential causes.currently, it’s believed a combination of genetic changes and environmental factors may be responsible for the condition.a number of genetic factors have been shown to increase a person’s risk of developing parkinson’s disease, although exactly how these make some people more susceptible to the condition is unclear.parkinson’s disease can run in families as a result of faulty genes being passed to a child by their parents. however, it’s rare for the disease to be inherited this way.some researchers also feel environmental factors may increase a person’s risk of developing parkinson’s disease.it’s been suggested that pesticides and herbicides used in farming and traffic or industrial pollution may contribute to the condition.however, the evidence linking environmental factors to parkinson’s disease is inconclusive.“parkinsonism” is the umbrella term used to describe the symptoms of tremors, muscle rigidity and slowness of movement.parkinson’s disease is the most common type of parkinsonism, but there are also some rarer types where a specific cause can be identified.these include parkinsonism caused by: medication (drug-induced parkinsonism) – where symptoms develop after taking certain medications, such as some types of antipsychotic medication, and usually improve once the medication is stopped other progressive brain conditions – such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple systems atrophy, and corticobasal degeneration cerebrovascular disease – where a series of smallstrokescause several parts of the brain to dieyou can read more aboutparkinsonismon the parkinson’s uk website.no tests can conclusively show that you have parkinson’s disease. your doctor will base a diagnosis on your symptoms, medical history and a detailed physical examination.your gp will talk to you about the problems you’re experiencing and may ask you to perform some simple mental or physical tasks, such as moving or walking around, to help with the diagnosis.in the early stages, your gp may find it difficult to say whether you definitely have the condition because symptoms are usually mild.if your gp suspects parkinson’s disease, you’ll be referred to a specialist. this will usually be: a neurologist – a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system a geriatrician – a specialist in problems affecting elderly peopleif your gp thinks you may be in the early stages of parkinson’s disease, you should see a specialist within six weeks. if they think you may be in the later stages, you should see a specialist within two weeks.the specialist will most likely ask you to perform a number of physical exercises so they can assess whether you have any problems with movement.a diagnosis of parkinson’s disease is likely if you have at least two of the three following symptoms: shaking or tremor in a part of your body that usually only occurs at rest slowness of movement (bradykinesia) muscle stiffness (rigidity)if your symptoms improve after taking a medication called levodopa, it’s more likely you have parkinson’s disease.special brain scans, such as a single photon emission computed tomography (spect) scan, may also be carried out in some cases to try to rule out other causes of your symptoms.being told you have parkinson’s disease can be emotionally distressing, and the news can often be difficult to take in.this means it’s

brain and nerves that control movement.increasing the levels of dopamine using levodopa usually improves movement problems.it is usually taken as a tablet or liquid, and is often combined with other medication, such as benserazide or carbidopa.these medications stop the levodopa being broken down in the bloodstream before it has a chance to get to the brain.they also reduce the side effects of levodopa, which include: feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting tiredness dizzinessif you’re prescribed levodopa, the initial dose is usually very small and will be gradually increased until it takes effect.at first, levodopa can cause a dramatic improvement in the symptoms.however, its effects can be less long-lasting over the following years – as more nerve cells in the brain are lost, there are fewer of them to absorb the medicine. this means the dose may need to be increased from time to time.long-term use of levodopa is also linked to problems such as uncontrollable, jerky muscle movements (dyskinesias) and “on-off” effects, where the person rapidly switches between being able to move (on) and being immobile (off).dopamine agonists act as a substitute for dopamine in the brain and have a similar but milder effect compared with levodopa. they can often be given less frequently than levodopa.they are often taken as a tablet, but are also available as a skin patch (rotigotine).sometimes dopamine agonists are taken at the same time as levodopa, as this allows lower doses of levodopa to be used.possible side effects of dopamine agonists include: nausea or vomiting tiredness and sleepiness dizzinessdopamine agonists can also cause hallucinations and increased confusion, so they need to be used with caution, particularly in elderly patients, who are more susceptible.for some people, dopamine agonists have been linked to the development of compulsive behaviours, especially at high doses, including addictive gambling and an excessively increased libido.talk to your healthcare specialist if you think you may be experiencing these problems.as the person themselves may not realise the problem, it’s key that carers and family members also note any abnormal behaviour and discuss it with an appropriate professional at the earliest opportunity.if you’re prescribed a course of dopamine agonists, the initial dose is usually very small to prevent nausea and other side effects.the dosage is gradually increased over a few weeks. if nausea becomes a problem, your gp may prescribe anti-sickness medication.a potentially serious, but uncommon, complication of dopamine agonist therapy is sudden onset of sleep.this generally happens as the dose is being increased and tends to settle once the dose is stable.people are usually advised to avoid driving while the dose is being increased in case this complication occurs.monoamine oxidase-b (mao-b) inhibitors, including selegiline and rasagiline, are another alternative to levodopa for treating early parkinson’s disease.they block the effects of an enzyme or brain substance that breaks down dopamine (monoamine oxidase-b), increasing dopamine levels.both selegiline and rasagiline can improve the symptoms of parkinson’s disease, although their effects are small compared with levodopa. they can be used alongside levodopa or dopamine agonists.mao-b inhibitors are generally very well tolerated, but can occasionally cause side effects, including: nausea headache abdominal pain high blood pressurecatechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) inhibitors are prescribed for people in later stages of parkinson’s disease. they prevent levodopa from being broken down by the enzyme comt.side effects of comt inhibitors include: nausea or vomiting diarrhoea abdominal painwhen parkinson’s symptoms become difficult to control with tablets alone, a number of other treatments can be considered.a dopamine agonist called apomorphine can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) either by: a single injection, when required a continuous infusion using a small pump carried around on your belt, under your clothing, or in a bagif you have severe on-off fluctuations, a type of levodopa called duodopa may be used.this medication comes as a gel that’s continuously pumped into your gut through a tube inserted through your abdominal wall.there’s an external pump attached to the end of the tube, which you carry around with you.about 25 specialist neuroscience centres in the uk offer this treatment. this treatment is only available if you have very severe on-off fluctuations or involuntary movements.most people with parkinson’s disease are treated with medication, although a type of surgery called deep brain stimulation is used in some cases.this surgery is also available in specialist neuroscience centres around the uk, but it’s not suitable for everyone.if surgery is being considered, your specialist will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you.deep brain stimulation involves surgically implanting a pulse generator similar to a heart pacemaker into your chest wall.this is connected to one or two fine wires placed under the skin, and is inserted precisely into specific areas in your brain.a tiny electric current is produced by the pulse generator, which runs through the wire and stimulates the part of your brain affected by parkinson’s disease.although surgery doesn’t cure parkinson’s disease, it can ease the symptoms for some people.as well as the main symptoms of movement problems, people with parkinson’s disease can experience a wide range of additional symptoms that may need to be treated separately.these include: depression and anxiety – this can be treated with self care measures such as exercise, psychological therapy or medication; read more abouttreating depression problems sleeping (insomnia) – this can be improved by making changes to your normal bedtime routine; read more abouttreating insomnia erectile

compared with standard ones.all clinical trials in the uk are carefully overseen to ensure they are worthwhile and safely conducted. participants in clinical trials sometimes do better overall than those in routine care.if you are asked if you want to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet about the trial.if you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. you can refuse to take part or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.some people with parkinson’s disease find complementary therapies help them feel better. many complementary treatments and therapies claim to ease the symptoms of parkinson’s disease.however, there’s no clinical evidence they’re effective in controlling the symptoms of parkinson’s disease.most people think complementary treatments have no harmful effects. however, some can be harmful and they shouldn’t be used instead of the medicines prescribed by your doctor.some types of herbal remedies, such as st john’s wort, can interact unpredictably if taken with some types of medication used to treat parkinson’s disease.if you’re considering using an alternative treatment along with your prescribed medicines, check with your care team first.it’s important to do what you can to stay physically and mentally healthy if you have parkinson’s disease.regular exercise is particularly important in helping relieve muscle stiffness, improving your mood, and relieving stress.there are many activities you can do to help keep yourself fit, ranging from more active sports like tennis andcycling, to less strenuous activities such aswalking, gardening andyoga.you should also try toeat a balanced dietcontaining all the food groups to give your body the nutrition it needs to stay healthy.everyone with a long-term condition is encouraged to get a yearlyflu jabeach autumn.thepneumococcal vaccinationis also usually recommended, which is a one-off injection that protects against a serious chest infection called pneumococcal pneumonia.being diagnosed with a long-term condition like parkinson’s disease can put a strain on you, your family and friends. it can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they’re close to you.dealing with the deterioration of symptoms, such as increasing difficulty with movement, may make you feel frustrated and depressed. spouses, partners or carers will inevitably feel anxious or frustrated as well.be open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. don’t feel shy about telling them you need some time to yourself, if that’s what you want.if you have any questions about your condition, your gp or parkinson’s disease specialist nurse may be able to help.you may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or someone at a specialist helpline. your gp surgery will have details of these.some people find it helpful to talk to others with parkinson’s disease, either at a local support group or in an internet chat room.it’s worth taking time to think about your specific needs and what would help you achieve the best quality of life.for example, you may wish to consider equipment, help in your home, and home adaptations.parkinson’s ukis the main parkinson’s support and research charity in the uk.they can offer the support and advice you may need if you’re

disease. you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.if you’ve been diagnosed with parkinson’s disease, you must inform the driver and vehicle licensing agency (dvla) and your insurance company.you won’t necessarily have to stop driving. you’ll be asked to complete a form providing more information about your condition, as well as details of your doctors and specialists. the dvla will use this to decide whether you’re fit to drive.complex parkinson’s disease is defined as the stage when treatment is unable to consistently control symptoms, or the person has developed uncontrollable jerky movements (disabling dyskinesia).these problems can still be helped by adjustment or addition of some of the medications used totreat parkinson’s disease, under the supervision of a doctor with a specialist interest in parkinson’s disease.as parkinson’s disease progresses, you’ll be invited to discuss the care you want with your healthcare team as you near the end of your life. this is known as palliative care.when there’s no cure for an illness, palliative care tries to alleviate symptoms, and is also aimed at making the end of a person’s life as comfortable as possible.this is done by attempting to relieve pain and other distressing symptoms, while providing psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family.palliative care can be provided at home or in a hospice, residential home or hospital. you may want to consider talking to your family and care team in advance about where you’d like to be

       " 'Patau’s syndrome': 'patau’s syndrome, also known as trisomy 13, is a rare but serious genetic condition. it begins to affect babies when they’re in the womb, and will continue to cause health problems throughout their life.in the uk, around 2 in every 10,000 births are affected by patau’s syndrome.when a baby is conceived (made), they inherit genetic material from both their parents. this genetic material is called a chromosome.humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes. in each pair, 1 of the chromosomes is inherited from the mother and 1 is inherited from the father.if a baby has patau’s syndrome, they have inherited an extra copy of chromosome 13. this extra copy can be present in some or all of the baby’s cells and can lead to health problems for the baby.there are 3 different forms of patau’s syndrome:in full form patau’s syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 13. this extra copy is present in all of the baby’s cells.around 80% of babies born with patau’s syndrome have the full form of the syndrome.in mosaic form patau’s syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 13, but the copy is only present in some of the baby’s cells.in partial form patau’s syndrome, the baby has only inherited part of an extra copy of chromosome 13. this is a very rare form of patau’s syndrome.most cases result from a random change in the egg or sperm in healthy parents. this change is not caused by anything the parents did before or during pregnancy.you’ll be offeredscreening for patau’s syndromewhen you’re between 11 and 14 weeks pregnant.the screening test will show if your baby has a high or low chance of having patau’s syndrome.if screening shows that there’s a high chance your baby has patau’s syndrome, you can choose to have a furtherdiagnostic testif you wish.no test can tell if your baby has full, mosaic or partial patau’s syndrome, or how they’ll be affected.around 7 in 10 (70%) of pregnancies diagnosed with patau’s syndrome from screening tests will end inmiscarriageorstillbirth.the risk of miscarriage decreases as the pregnancy progresses, but there’s still a risk of stillbirth.if your baby is affected by patau’s syndrome, it’s likely they will have some health conditions. exactly how your baby is affected will depend on the form of patau’s syndrome they have.full form patau’s syndrome is considered to be a life-limiting condition. this means it can affect how long a baby can live.around 4 in 10 (43.1%) babies with full form patau’s syndrome will live longer than 1 week. around 1 in 10 (9.7%) will live longer than 5 years.babies born with full form patau’s syndrome will have a learning disability that may be severe. they’re also likely to have a wide range of health conditions, some of which can be serious. statistically:currently we can’t predict how babies with mosaic or partial forms of patau’s syndrome will be affected. this is because it depends on: how many cells contain the extra chromosome (mosaic) how much of the extra chromosome they have (partial)some babies may have severe health problems like those seen in full form patau’s syndrome. other babies may have much less serious health issues. there are even cases where the baby seems to have no health issues at all.most babies with a form of patau’s syndrome will have some form of learning disability.the life expectancy for babies with mosaic or partial forms of patau’s syndrome is also very variable. some will live long lives, while others will have a much shorter life expectancy.each child is unique, and patau’s syndrome will affect each child differently. like all children they will have their own personalities, likes and dislikes, and things that make them who they are.babies with full form patau’s syndrome usually have a low birthweight and are considered “medically fragile”. this means they are at high risk of infections and complications that require treatment in hospital. they may also: have difficulty feeding and may need fed by a tube have difficulty breathing and have apnoea (pauses in their breathing)despite their complex needs, children with patau’s syndrome can make progress with their development, although slowly.many children are reported to be able to communicate their needs, show awareness of surroundings, and some can sit and stand supported. there are also cases of older children attending school.feedback from many parents suggests that children with patau’s syndrome have a good quality of life and are valued members of the family.babies with patau’s syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (cardriss) register. the register is maintained by public health scotland.the register records how many

different types of tissue. the type of penile cancer you have will depend on the type of cell the cancer developed from.the most common types of penile cancer include: squamous cell penile cancer – which accounts for more than 90% of cases and starts in the cells that cover the surface of the penis carcinoma in situ (cis) – a particular type of squamous cell cancer where only the cells in the skin of the penis are affected and it hasn’t spread any deeper adenocarcinoma – cancer that starts in the glandular cells of the penis that produce sweat melanoma of the penis – where the cancer

is also a risk factor for cancer of the penis. the condition rarely affects men and anyone with a penis under 40 years of age. it most commonly occurs in men and anyone with a penis aged over 60.smoking is the most significant lifestyle factor associated with penile cancer. chemicals found in cigarettes can damage cells in the penis, which increases your risk of getting the condition.conditions that affect the penis, such as phimosis, which makes the foreskin difficult to retract, increase your chances of developing infections such as balanitis.repeated infections are linked to a higher risk of developing some types of penile cancer, because they can weaken your immune system.thecancer research ukwebsite has more information about therisks and causes of penile

will be removed so it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells.treatment for penile cancer will depend on the size of the affected area and the rate at which the cancer has spread.for example, in most cases of carcinoma in situ (cis), where only the skin cells of the penis are affected, treatment will usually involve either using a chemotherapy cream or having laser surgery to remove the affected area of skin. you will usually have a skin graft after surgery.the main treatments for penile cancer that isn’t at a very early stage are: surgery radiotherapy chemotherapysurgery

much penile tissue as possible.as part of most treatments for penile cancer, the lymph glands (small organs that are part of the immune system) in the groin will be assessed to determine if the cancer has spread.the test that’s used, known as a sentinel node biopsy, is widely available in the uk. in some cases, the lymph glands may need to be surgically removed.as with most types of cancer, the

peripheral neuropathy isn’t treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected. this can lead to gangrene (tissue death) if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the affected foot has to be amputated.peripheral neuropathy may affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system (cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy). you may need treatment to increase your blood pressure or, in rare cases, apacemaker.read more about complications of peripheral neuropathysymptoms vary according to the type of peripheral neuropathy and may develop quickly or slowly.the main types of peripheral neuropathy include: sensory neuropathy – damage to the nerves that carry messages of touch, temperature, pain and other sensations to the brain motor neuropathy – damage to the nerves that control movement autonomic neuropathy – damage to the nerves that control involuntary bodily processes, such as digestion, bladder function and control of blood pressure mononeuropathy – damage to a single nerve outside of the central nervous systemin many cases, someone with peripheral neuropathy may have more than one of these types at the same time.a combination of sensory and motor neuropathy is particularly common (sensorimotor polyneuropathy).the symptoms of the main types of peripheral neuropathy are described below.symptoms of sensory neuropathy can include: prickling and tingling sensation in the affected body part pins and needles numbness and less of an ability to feel pain or changes in temperature, particularly in your feet a burning or sharp pain, usually in the feet feeling pain from something that should not be painful at all, such as a very light touch (allodynia) loss of balance or co-ordination caused by less ability to tell the position of the feet or hands (sensory ataxia)symptoms of motor neuropathy can include: twitching and muscle cramps muscle weakness or paralysis affecting one or more muscles thinning (wasting) of muscles foot drop – difficulty lifting up the front part of your foot and toes, particularly noticeable when walkingdamage to the autonomic nerves can result in a wide range of symptoms depending on where in the body the damage occurs.symptoms of autonomic neuropathy can include: constipationordiarrhoea, particularly at night feeling sick, bloating and belching low blood pressure(postural or orthostatic hypotension), which can make you feel faint or dizzy when standing up rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) excessive sweatingor a lack of sweating problems with sexual function, such aserectile dysfunctionin men difficulty fully emptying your bladder of urine bowel incontinence(loss of bowel control)depending on the specific nerve affected, symptoms of mononeuropathy can include: altered sensation or weakness in the fingers double vision or other problems with focusing your eyes, sometimes with eye pain weakness of one side of your face bell’s palsy foot or shin pain, weakness or altered sensationthe most common type of mononeuropathy is carpal tunnel syndrome (cts). the carpal tunnel is a small tunnel in your wrist.in cts, the median nerve becomes compressed where it passes through this tunnel, which may cause tingling, pain or numbness in the fingers.diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in the uk.neuropathy can also be caused by other health conditions and certain medications. in some cases, no cause can be identified and this is termed idiopathic neuropathy.peripheral neuropathy caused by eithertype 1 diabetesortype 2 diabetesis called diabetic polyneuropathy. it’s probably caused by high levels of glucose in your blood damaging the tiny blood vessels that supply your nerves.peripheral neuropathy becomes more likely the longer you’ve had diabetes. up to 1 in every 4 people with the condition experience some pain caused by nerve damage.if you have diabetes, your risk of polyneuropathy is higher if your blood sugar is poorly controlled or you: smoke regularly consume large amounts of alcohol are over 40 years oldif you have diabetes, you should examine your own feet regularly to check for ulcers (open wounds or sores) or chilblains.as well as diabetes, there are many other possible causes of peripheral neuropathy.some of the health conditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy include: excessive alcohol drinking for years low levels of vitamin b12 or other vitamins physical damage to the nerves – such as from an injury or during surgery anunderactive thyroid gland(hypothyroidism) certain infections – such asshingles,lyme disease, diphtheria, botulism andhiv inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis) chronic liver disease orchronic kidney disease monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (mgus) – the presence of an abnormal protein in the blood certain types of cancer, such aslymphoma(a cancer of the lymphatic system) andmultiple myeloma(a type of bone marrow cancer) charcot-marie-tooth (cmt) disease and other types of hereditary motor sensory neuropathy – genetic conditions that cause nerve damage, particularly in the feet having high levels of toxins in your body, such as arsenic, lead or mercury guillain-barré syndrome – a rare condition that causes rapid onset of paralysis within days amyloidosis – a group of rare but serious conditions caused by deposits of abnormal protein called amyloid in tissues and organs throughout the body conditions caused by overactivity of the immune system – such asrheumatoid arthritis,lupusorsjogren’s syndromea few medications may sometimes cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect in some people. these include: some types ofchemotherapyfor cancer – especially forbowel cancer, lymphoma ormyeloma some antibiotics, if taken for months – such as metronidazole or nitrofurantoin phenytoin – used to treatepilepsy– if taken for a long time amiodarone and thalidomidea number of tests may be used to diagnose peripheral neuropathy and its underlying cause.when you see your gp, they’ll ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area of your body. this may involve testing sensation, strength and reflexes.your doctor may also arrange blood tests, especially to check for causes such asdiabetesorvitamin b12 deficiency.some people may need to see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system) in hospital for further tests such as: a nerve conduction test (ncs) – where small metal wires called electrodes are placed on your skin which release tiny electric shocks that stimulate your nerves; the speed and strength of the nerve signal is measured electromyography (emg) – where a small needle is inserted through your skin into your muscle and used to measure the electrical activity of your musclesncs and emg are usually carried out at the same time.your gp can usually identify the underlying cause of a peripheral neuropathy.if diabetes is suspected, they can usually make a confident diagnosis based on your symptoms, a physical examination and checking the levels of glucose in your blood and urine.if you’re taking a medication known to cause peripheral neuropathy, your gp may temporarily stop or reduce your dose to see whether your symptoms improve.if the cause is uncertain, you may be referred to a neurologist for more extensive blood tests to check: whether you have a rare acquired cause that may be responsible whether you have a genetic abnormality, such as charcot-marie-tooth diseaseyou may need alumbar punctureto test the cerebrospinal fluid (a clear, colourless fluid that surrounds and supports the brain and spinal cord) for inflammation.occasionally, a nervebiopsymay be carried out as part of your diagnosis. this is a minor surgical procedure where a small sample of a peripheral nerve is removed from near your ankle so it can be examined under a microscope.it’s then checked for changes that could be a sign of certain types of peripheral neuropathy. however, nerve biopsies are rarely needed.you may also need a scan to look for any underlying cause of your neuropathy, such as: anx-ray acomputerised tomography (ct) scan amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scantreatment for peripheral neuropathy may include treating any underlying cause or any symptoms you’re experiencing.treatment may be more successful for certain underlying causes. for example, ensuringdiabetesis well controlled may help improve neuropathy or at least stop it getting worse.there are many different possiblecauses of peripheral neuropathy, some of which can be treated in different ways. for example: diabetes can sometimes be controlled by lifestyle changes, such as stopping smoking, cutting down on alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly vitamin b12 deficiencycan be treated with b12 injections or tablets peripheral neuropathy caused by a medication you’re taking may improve if the medication is stoppedsome less common types of peripheral neuropathy may be treated with medication, such as: corticosteroids– powerful anti-inflammatory medication immunosuppressants – medications that reduce the activity of the immune system injections of immunoglobulin – mixture of blood proteins called antibodies made by the immune systemhowever, the underlying cause may not always be untreatable.you may also require medication to treat any nerve pain (neuropathic pain) you’re experiencing.unlike most other types of pain, neuropathic pain doesn’t usually get better with common painkillers, such asparacetamolandibuprofenand other medications are often used.these should usually be started at the minimum dose, with the dose gradually increased until you notice an effect, because the ideal dose for each person is unpredictable. higher doses may be better at managing the pain, but are also more likely to cause side effects.the most common side effects are tiredness, dizziness or feeling “drunk”. if you get these, it may be necessary to reduce your dose. don’t drive or operate machinery if you experience drowsiness or blurred vision. you also may become more sensitive to the effects of alcohol.the side effects should improve after a week or two as your body gets used to the medication. however, if your side effects continue, tell your gp as it may be possible to change to a different medication that suits you better.even if the first medication tried doesn’t help, others may.many of these medications may also be used for treating other conditions, such as depression, epilepsy, anxiety or headaches. if you’re given anantidepressant, this may treat pain even if you’re not depressed. this doesn’t mean your doctor suspects you’re depressed.the main medications recommended for neuropathic pain include: amitriptyline – also used for treatment ofheadachesanddepression duloxetine – also used for treatment of bladder problems and depression pregabalin and gabapentin – also used to treatepilepsy, headaches oranxietythere are also some additional medications that can be used to relieve pain in a specific area of the body or to relieve particularly severe pain for short periods. these are described below.if your pain is confined to a particular area of your body and you can’t, or would prefer not to, take the medications above, you may benefit from using capsaicin cream.capsaicin is the substance that makes chilli peppers hot and is thought to work in neuropathic pain by stopping the nerves sending pain messages to the brain.a pea-sized amount of capsaicin cream is rubbed on the painful area of skin three or four times a day.side effects of capsaicin cream can include skin irritation and a burning sensation in the treated area when you first start treatment.don’t use capsaicin cream on broken or inflamed skin and always wash your hands after applying it.this is a large sticking plaster that contains a local anaesthetic. it’s useful when pain affects only a small area of skin. it’s stuck over the area of painful skin and the local anaesthetic is absorbed into the skin that’s covered.tramadol is a powerful painkiller related to morphine that can be used to treat neuropathic pain that doesn’t respond to other treatments your gp can prescribe.like all opioids, tramadol can be addictive if it’s taken for a long time. it will usually only be prescribed for a short time. tramadol can be useful to take at times when your pain is worse.common side effects of tramadol include: feeling sick or vomiting dizziness constipationin addition to treating pain, you may also require treatment to help you manage other symptoms you’re experiencing as a result of peripheral neuropathy.for example, if you have muscle weakness, you may need physiotherapy to learn exercises to improve your muscle strength. you may also need to wear splints to support weak ankles or use walking aids to help you get around.other problems associated with peripheral neuropathy may be treatable with medication, such as: erectile dysfunction constipation the slow movement of food through your stomach (gastroparesis)in some cases, you may need more invasive treatment, such as botulinum toxin injections forhyperhidrosisorurinary catheterisationif you have problems emptying your bladder.peripheral neuropathy can sometimes cause other medical problems, such as foot ulcers and heart rhythm changes, and blood circulation problems.these complications vary depending on the underlying cause of the condition.a diabetic foot ulcer is an open wound or sore on the skin that’s slow to heal. these are common in people with diabetic polyneuropathy.if you have numb feet, it’s easy to cut your foot by stepping on something sharp.an ulcer can also occur if you unknowingly develop a blister caused by badly fitting shoes. if you don’t feel any pain, you may continue walking without protecting the blister. if the cut or blister gets worse, it may develop into an ulcer.high blood sugar can damage your blood vessels, causing the blood supply to your feet to become restricted. a reduced blood supply to the skin on your feet means it receives a lower number of infection-fighting cells, which can mean wounds take longer to heal and can lead to gangrene.if you do develop a wound infection in one of your feet as a result of peripheral neuropathy, there’s a risk this could lead to gangrene (death of part of the skin or underlying tissues).if gangrene does develop, you may need surgery to remove the damaged tissue (known as debridement) and antibiotics to treat any underlying infection. in severe cases your toe or foot may need to be amputated.if you have diabetes, you should take extra care of your feet. get your feet checked regularly by a podiatrist (a medical professional, also known as a chiropodist, who specialises in foot care).cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (can) is another potentially serious problem that’s common in people with diabetic polyneuropathy.can occurs when damage to the peripheral nerves disrupts the automatic functions that control your blood circulation and heartbeat.the two main noticeable symptoms of can are: an inability to exercise for more than a very short period of time orthostatic hypotension – a type of low blood pressure that can make you feel dizzy or faint when you stand upyou may be able to control the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension by using a number of self care techniques, such as: standing or sitting up slowly and gradually drinking plenty of fluids to increase the volume of your blood and raise your blood pressure wearing compression stockings to help prevent blood falling back down into your legs tilting your bed by raising it at the head endin some cases, medication may be required to treat orthostatic hypotension.two widely used medications are: fludrocortisone – which works by increasing the volume of your blood midodrine – which works by tightening your blood vesselsa more serious concern with can is that your heart may suddenly develop an abnormal pattern of beating (arrhythmia), which could lead to a cardiac arrest, where your heart stops beating altogether.to prevent this, you may be prescribed medication to help regulate the beating of your heart, such as flecainide,beta-blockersor amiodarone.if you have can, you’ll probably need to have regular check-ups so your heart function can be monitored. trigeminal neuralgia pain concern

       " 'Personality disorder': 'personality disorders are conditions where an individual differs significantly from an average person. this may be related to how they:changes in how a person feels and distorted beliefs about other people can lead to odd behaviour. this can be distressing and may upset others.common features of a personality disorder include: being overwhelmed by negative feelings like distress, anxiety, worthlessness or anger avoiding other people feeling empty and emotionally disconnected odd behaviour difficulty maintaining stable and close relationships, especially with partners, children and professional carers periods of losing contact with realitysome people may also have difficulty managing negative feelings without self-harming. this can include abusing drugs and alcohol or taking overdoses. in rare cases, it may include threatening other people.people with personality disorders often experience other mental health problems. this includesdepressionandsubstance misuse.symptoms typically get worse withstress.personality disorders are common mental health problems.they usually emerge in adolescence and continue into adulthood. they may be mild, moderate or severe. people may have periods of “remission” where they function well.personality disorders may be associated with genetic and family factors. experiences of distress or fear during childhood, like neglect or abuse, are common.many people have only mild conditions so only need help at times of stress (such as bereavement). people with more severe problems may need specialist help for longer.there are different types of personality disorders.a person with a paranoid personality disorder is extremely distrustful and suspicious. other features include: thinking other people are lying to them or trying to manipulate them feeling they cannot trust their friends and associates worrying that any confidential information shared with others will be used against them thinking there are hidden meanings in remarks most would regard as innocent worrying that their spouse or partner is unfaithful, despite a lack of evidencesomeone with a schizoid personality disorder may appear cold and detached. they may also avoid making close social contact with others. other features include: preferring to take part in activities that do not need interaction with others having little desire to form close relationships, including sexual relationships being uninterested when receiving criticism or praise having a limited ability to experience pleasure or joya person with a schizotypal personality disorder is likely to: have poor social skills have delusional thoughts behave in unusual waysother features include: believing in special powers – like telepathy or the ability to influence other people’s emotions and actions having unusual ways of speaking – like long, rambling vague sentences or going off on a tangent experiencing excessive anxiety in social situations – even if they’ve known a particular person or group of people for a long timea person may also attach undue and misguided significance to everyday events. for example, thinking newspaper headlines are secret messages to them.a person with an antisocial personality disorder sees other people as vulnerable. this means they may intimidate or bully others without remorse.symptoms include: lack of concern, regret or remorse about other people’s distress irresponsibility and disregard for normal social behaviour difficulty in sustaining long-term relationships little ability to tolerate frustration and control their anger lack of guilt, or not learning from their mistakes blaming others for problems in their livesa person with borderline personality disorder: is emotionally unstable has impulses to self-harm has very intense and unstable relationships with othersa person with a histrionic personality disorder is anxious about being ignored. as a result, they feel an overwhelming urge to be noticed. they also have the urge to be the centre of everyone’s attention.features include: displaying excessive emotion, yet appearing to lack real emotional sincerity dressing provocatively and engaging in inappropriate flirting or sexually seductive behaviour moving quickly from one emotional state to another being self-centred and caring little about other people constantly seeking reassurance and approval from other peoplesymptoms and signs may co-exist with borderline and narcissistic personality disorders.a person with narcissistic personality disorder swings between: seeing themselves as special, and fearing they’re worthlessthey may act as if they have an inflated sense of their own importance. they may also show an intense need for other people to look up to them.other symptoms include: exaggerating their achievements and abilities thinking they’re entitled to be treated better than other people exploiting other people for their own personal gain lacking empathy for other people’s weaknesses looking down on people they feel are “beneath” them feeling deeply envious of people they see as being “above” thema person with avoidant personality disorder: appears painfully shy is socially inhibited feels inadequate is extremely sensitive to rejectionunlike people with schizoid personality disorders, they desire close relationships with others. however, they lack the confidence and ability to form them.a person with dependent personality disorder feels they can’t be independent. they may show an excessive need for others to look after them and are “clingy”. other features include: finding it difficult to make decisions without other people’s guidance needing others to take responsibility over what should be their own life choices not being able to express disagreement with other people finding it difficult to start new activities due to a lack of confidence going to extremes to get support and comfort feeling helpless and uncomfortable when alone urgently needing to start a new relationship when one comes to an end having an unrealistic and constant fear they’ll be left alone to fend for themselvesa person with obsessive compulsive personality disorder is: anxious about issues that seem out of control or “messy” preoccupied with orderliness and ways to control their environmentthey may come across to others as a “control freak”.other features include: having an excessive interest in lists, timetables and rules perfectionism – being so focused on completing a task perfectly that they struggle to finish it being a workaholic having very rigid views about issues like morality, ethics and how a person should behave hoarding items that seem to have no monetary or sentimental value being unable to delegate tasks to other people disliking spending money, as they think it’s always better to save for a “rainy day”this personality disorder differs fromobsessive compulsive disorder (ocd).people with ocd are aware that their behaviour is abnormal and are anxious about it. whereas, most people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder think their behaviour is acceptable. they usually have no desire to change it.some people with ocd feel the need to carry out rituals. for example, having to touch every second lamppost as they walk down the street. this is not usually the case with people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder.people with ocd may feel the need to make lists or organise items in their house, but feel anxious about doing so. people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder feel less anxiety through such tasks. they may become irritated when prevented from doing so.many people recover from personality disorders over time.treatment usually involves a course of psychological therapy tailored to the individual. this treatment usually lasts at least 6 months. but, it may last longer depending on the severity of the condition and other problems.psychotherapyinvolves discussing thoughts, emotions and behaviours with a trained professional. the aim is to improve people’s ability to regulate their thoughts and emotions.some therapies focus on dysfunctional thoughts. others focus on self-reflection and being aware of how your mind works. some therapies, especially group therapies, help people understand social relationships better.psychological therapies can be effective for many personality disorders. but, they should only be delivered by a trained professional. they should have experience working with personality disorders and other conditions. this is because personality disorders can be associated with high-risk behaviours, like self-harm.the psychotherapist will listen and discuss important issues with you. they can also suggest strategies to resolve problems. if necessary, they’ll help you change your attitudes and behaviour.a range of different psychotherapies are used to treat personality disorders.read more about types of counselling and therapyno medications are currently licensed for the treatment of any personality disorder. but, medications may be prescribed to treat associated

       " 'Pleurisy': 'pleurisy is inflammation of the sheet-like layers that cover the lungs (the pleura).the most common symptom of pleurisy is a sharp chest pain when breathing deeply. sometimes the pain is also felt in the shoulder.the pain may be worse when you cough, sneeze or move around, and it may be relieved by taking shallow breaths.other symptoms can include shortness of breath and a drycough.visit your gp if you experience the above symptoms. seek immediate medical help if your chest pain is severe, particularly if you also have other symptoms, such as coughing up blood, nausea or sweating.pleurisy can usually be diagnosed by studying your symptoms. your gp can listen to your chest to check for the distinctive dry, crunching sound that suggests you may have pleurisy.further tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause of your pleurisy and to assess how severe it is. these can include: blood teststo determine whether you have an infection or an autoimmune condition chestx-rays anultrasound scan acomputerised tomography (ct) scan abiopsy– a small sample of pleural or lung tissue is removed for further testingmost cases are the result of a viral infection (such as theflu) or a bacterial infection (such aspneumonia).in rarer cases, pleurisy can be caused by conditions such as a blood clot blocking the flow of blood into the lungs (pulmonary embolism) orlung cancer.pleurisy can affect people of all ages, but people of 65 years and over are most at risk, because they’re more likely to develop achest infection.read more about thecauses of pleurisy.treatment for pleurisy depends on the underlying cause.for example, pleurisy caused by a viral infection will often resolve itself without treatment. however, pleurisy caused by a bacterial infection is usually treated withantibiotics, and people who are frail or already in poor health may be admitted to hospital.non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such asibuprofen, are often used to relieve the chest pain associated with pleurisy.if excess fluid builds up between the pleural layers, it may be necessary to drain the fluid to prevent breathing difficulties.read more abouttreating pleurisy.pleurisy is inflammation of the pleura. it’s usually caused by another condition, such as an infection, but sometimes no cause can be identified.the pleura are two thin sheets of tissue that separate the lungs and ribcage. one is attached to the ribcage and the other is attached to the lungs.between the pleural sheets is a thin layer of liquid that lubricates the pleura, helping to reduce friction when you breathe in and out.when there’s inflammation, the surfaces of the two layers can become rough and the fluid can become sticky. this can cause the layers to rub together, resulting in pain and discomfort.an infection is the most common cause of pleurisy. any type of infection has the potential to spread to the pleura, but viral infections are usually responsible. viruses known to cause pleurisy include: theinfluenza (flu)virus the epstein-barr virus – which causesglandular fever cytomegalovirus (cmv) – a common virus found in most people, which doesn’t usually cause any noticeable symptoms parainfluenza – the virus that causes the childhood condition croupin some cases, pleurisy is caused by bacteria, such as: streptococcal bacteria – often associated withpneumonia, throat infections and some types of skin infections, such asimpetigoandcellulitis staphylococcal bacteria – often associated with skin infections,food poisoningand, more seriously,blood poisoning (sepsis)meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) can cause pleurisy, especially in hospital patients. mrsa is a type of bacteria with a resistance to a number of commonly used antibiotics.other possible causes of pleurisy include: injury – if the ribs are bruised or fractured, the pleura can become inflamed pulmonary embolism – a blood clot developing inside the lungs sickle cell anaemia– a blood disorder that usually affects people of african or caribbean descent chemotherapyandradiotherapy hiv or aids lung cancer mesothelioma– a type of cancer caused by inhaling asbestosautoimmune conditions, such asrheumatoid arthritisandlupus, are other possible causes of pleurisy. in these conditions, something goes wrong with the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) and it begins to attack healthy tissue.treatment for pleurisy usually involves relieving pain and treating the underlying cause of the condition.if treated promptly, pleurisy often resolves without any lasting damage to the lungs.the chest pain associated with pleurisy can be treated using a type of painkiller known asnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). most often,ibuprofenis used.if nsaids are ineffective or unsuitable, you may be prescribed another painkiller, such asparacetamolor codeine.it may seem strange, but lying down on the side of your chest that hurts may also help to reduce the pain.it may also be necessary to treat the underlying cause of your pleurisy.if you have pleurisy caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll need a course ofantibiotics. depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may be either tablets or injections. combinations of different antibiotics are sometimes used.however, if your pleurisy is caused by a viral infection, further treatment may not be required, as the infection usually resolves itself after a few days.in cases where your symptoms are particularly severe or you’re already in poor health, you may need to be admitted to hospital so your body’s functions can be supported until your condition stabilises.in some cases, pleurisy causes a build-up of excess fluid around the lungs called pleural effusion.pleural effusion can result in shortness of breath that gets progressively worse. this is more likely in cases of pleurisy caused by pulmonary embolism or a bacterial infection.if pleural effusion doesn’t clear up as your pleurisy is treated, or if you’re very short of breath, a tube will need to be inserted so the fluid can be drained away.the tube may be inserted using eithergeneral anaesthetic(where you’re asleep) orlocal anaesthetic(the area where the tube is inserted is numbed).if a lot of fluid has to be drained away, you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. flu pneumonia pleurisy',\n",
       " 'Pneumonia': 'pneumonia is swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. it’s usually caused by a bacterial infection.at the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs are clusters of tiny air sacs. if you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid.the symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days.common symptoms of pneumonia include: acough– which may be dry, or produce thick yellow, green, brown or blood-stained mucus (phlegm) difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow, and you may feel breathless, even when resting rapid heartbeat fever feeling generally unwell sweating and shivering loss of appetite chest pain – which gets worse when breathing or coughingless common symptoms include: coughing up blood (haemoptysis) headaches fatigue nausea or vomiting wheezing joint and muscle pain feeling confused and disorientated, particularly in elderly peoplesee your gp if you feel unwell and you have typical symptoms of pneumonia.seek urgent medical attention if you’re experiencing severe symptoms, such as rapid breathing, chest pain or confusion.in the uk, pneumonia affects around 8 in 1,000 adults each year. it’s more widespread in autumn and winter.pneumonia can affect people of any age, but it’s more common – and can be more serious – in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly.people in these groups are more likely to need hospital treatment if they develop pneumonia.pneumonia is usually the result of a pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called streptococcus pneumoniae.many different types of bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi.as well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include: viral pneumonia – most commonly caused by therespiratory syncytial virus (rsv)and sometimesinfluenzatype a or b; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children aspiration pneumonia – caused by breathing in vomit, a foreign object, such as a peanut, or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical fungal pneumonia – rare in the uk and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system hospital-acquired pneumonia – pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumoniathe following groups have an increased risk of developing pneumonia: babies and very young children elderly people people who smoke people with other health conditions, such asasthma,cystic fibrosis, or a heart, kidney or liver condition people with a weakened immune system – for example, as a result of a recent illness, such asflu, havinghiv or aids, havingchemotherapy, or taking medication following an organ transplantyour gp may be able to diagnose pneumonia by asking about your symptoms and examining your chest. further tests may be needed in some cases.pneumonia can be difficult to diagnose because it shares many symptoms with other conditions, such as thecommon cold,bronchitisandasthma.to help make a diagnosis, your gp may ask you: whether you feel breathless or you’re breathing faster than usual how long you’ve had your cough, and whether you’re coughing up mucus and what colour it is if the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or outyour gp may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds.they may also listen to your chest by tapping it. lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound from normal healthy lungs.if you have mild pneumonia, you probably won’t need to have a chestx-rayor any other tests.you may need a chest x-ray or other tests, such as a sputum (mucus) test orblood tests, if your symptoms haven’t improved within 48 hours of starting treatment.mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by: getting plenty of rest takingantibiotics drinking plenty of fluidsif you don’t have any other health problems, you should respond well to treatment and soon recover, although your cough may last for some time.as pneumonia isn’t usually passed from one person to another, it’s safe to be around others, including family members.however, people with a weakened immune system should avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better.for at-risk groups, pneumonia can be severe and may need to be treated in hospital.this is because it can lead to serious complications, which in some cases can be fatal, depending on a person’s health and age.read more abouttreating pneumonia.complications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, such asdiabetes.possible complications of pneumonia include: pleurisy– where the thin linings between your lungs and ribcage (pleura) become inflamed, which can lead to respiratory failure a lung abscess – a rare complication that’s mostly seen in people with a serious pre-existing illness or a history of severe alcohol misuse blood poisoning (septicaemia)– also a rare but serious complicationyou’ll be admitted to hospital for treatment if you develop one of these complications.although most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and aren’t passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading.for example, you should: cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when you cough or sneeze throw away used tissues immediately – germs can live for several hours after they leave your nose or mouth wash your hands regularly to avoid transferring germs to other people or objectsa healthy lifestyle can also help prevent pneumonia. for example, you should avoid smoking as it damages your lungs and increases the chance of infection.find out how tostop smoking.excessive and prolonged alcohol misuse also weakens your lungs’ natural defences against infections, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia.people at high risk of pneumonia should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine and flu vaccine.mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home with rest, antibiotics and by drinking plenty of fluids. more severe cases may need hospital treatment.unless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise, you should always finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better.if you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic.after starting treatment, your symptoms should steadily improve.however, how quickly they improve will depend on how severe your pneumonia is.as a general guide, after: one week – fever should have resolved four weeks – chest pain and mucus production should have substantially reduced six weeks – cough and breathlessness should have substantially reduced three months – most symptoms should have resolved, but you may still feel very tired (fatigue) six months – most people will feel back to normalvisit your gp if your symptoms don’t improve within three days of startingantibiotics.symptoms may not improve if: the bacteria causing the infection is resistant to

muscle stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes. it may also cause other symptoms, including: high temperature (fever) and sweating extreme tiredness (fatigue) loss of appetite weight loss depressionif you have pain and stiffness that lasts longer than a week, you should see your gp so the cause can be investigated.diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica can be difficult because the symptoms are similar to those of many other conditions, includingrheumatoid arthritis. these conditions will need to be ruled out before polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosed.read more about thesymptoms of polymyalgia rheumaticaanddiagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica.the cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be responsible.polymyalgia rheumatica is relatively common in the uk. it’s estimated that one in every 1,200 people develop the condition every year.polymyalgia rheumatica is age-related. most people who are diagnosed with the condition are over 70. it’s extremely rare in people younger than 50. it’s also more common in women than men.the main treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica is acoritcosteroid medicationcalled prednisolone, which is used to help relieve the symptoms.you’ll initially be prescribed a high dose of prednisolone, which will be reduced gradually over time.most people with polymyalgia rheumatica will need to take a long-term course of corticosteroid treatment (lasting 18 months to two years) to prevent their symptoms returning.read more abouttreating polymyalgia rheumatica.the most common symptom of polymyalgia rheumatica (pmr) is pain and stiffness in the shoulder muscles, which develops quickly over a few days or weeks.the muscles in the neck and hips are also often affected. both sides of the body are usually affected.the stiffness often feels worse first thing in the morning after you wake up and starts to improve after about 45 minutes as you become more active.some people with polymyalgia rheumatica have additional symptoms, including: a mild high temperature (fever) of 37-38c (98.6-100.4f) depression fatigue (extreme tiredness) loss of appetite weight lossif you have symptoms of pain and stiffness that last longer than a week, you should make an appointment to see your gp so that the cause can be investigated.you should seek immediate

which is worse when you’re eating pain in the tongue when chewing vision loss or vision disturbances, such as double visionthese symptoms may indicate a more serious condition called giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis).call your gp immediately for advice if you have any of the above symptoms. if this isn’t possible, contact your localout of hours serviceor call the nhs 24 ‘111’ service.diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica (pmr) can often be quite a lengthy process that involves several different tests.this is because the condition shares many symptoms with more common health conditions, such asrheumatoid arthritis, which need to be ruled out first.there’s no specific test for polymyalgia rheumatica, but it’s likely that a series ofblood testswill be carried out.two blood tests –erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr)andc-reactive protein (crp)– can be used to check the levels of inflammation in your body.if the esr and crp test results are normal, it’s unlikely that polymyalgia rheumatica will be diagnosed because your doctor won’t want to prescribe a long-term course of steroids if the diagnosis is uncertain. sometimes, the esr may be normal and crp may be raised, which would be more likely to indicate a positive diagnosis. this is why both tests are usually carried out at the same time.as inflammation is a characteristic of many conditions, high levels don’t automatically mean that you have polymyalgia rheumatica. further tests may be needed to help rule out other conditions that cause inflammation. for example, a test forrheumatoid factor and anti-ccp antibodies, may be carried out to rule out rheumatoid arthritis.blood tests can also help determine: whether there’s an infection in your blood how well some of your organs, such as your kidneys, are working whether you have anoveractive thyroid glandor anunderactive thyroid gland(both conditions can cause muscle pain)you may also have a urine test to check how well your liver is functioning.x-raysandultrasound scansmay also be used to look at the condition of your bones and joints.after other possible causes of your symptoms have been ruled out, a checklist can be used to see whether your symptoms match those most commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.a confident diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica can usually be made if you meet all of the following criteria: you’re over 50 years of age you have pain in your shoulders or your hips you have stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes your symptoms have lasted longer than two weeks blood tests show raised levels of inflammation in your body your symptoms rapidly improve after treatment withcorticosteroidsread more abouttreating polymyalgia rheumatica.steroid medication (corticosteroids) is the preferred treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica (pmr).a type of corticosteroid called prednisolone is usually prescribed.prednisolone works by blocking the effects of certain chemicals that cause inflammation inside your body. it doesn’t cure polymyalgia rheumatica, but it can help relieve the symptoms.when used to treat polymyalgia rheumatica, prednisolone is taken as a tablet. most people will be prescribed several tablets to take once a day.you’ll be prescribed a high dose of prednisolone initially, and the dose will be gradually reduced every one to two months.although your symptoms should improve within a few days of starting treatment, you’ll probably need to continue taking a low dose of prednisolone for about two years.in many cases, polymyalgia rheumatica improves on its own after this time. however, there’s a chance that the condition will return (relapse) once treatment stops.don’t suddenly stop taking steroid medication unless a doctor in charge of your care tells you it’s safe to do so. suddenly stopping treatment with steroids can make you feel very ill.about one in 20 people who take prednisolone will experience changes in their mental state when they take the medication.you may feeldepressedandsuicidal, anxious or confused. some people also experience hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there). contact your gp as soon as possible if you experience changes to your mental state.other side effects of prednisolone include: increased appetite that often leads to weight gain increased blood pressure mood changes, such as becoming aggressive or irritable with people weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) stomach ulcers increased risk of infection, particularly with the varicella-zoster virus (the virus that causeschickenpoxandshingles)seek immediate medical advice if you think you’ve been exposed to the varicella-zoster virus, or if a member of your household develops chickenpox or shingles.the risk of these side effects should improve as your dose of prednisolone is decreased.seeside effects of corticosteroidsfor more information about how these side effects may affect you and how they’re treated.sometimes, other medicines may be combined with corticosteroids to help prevent relapses or to allow your dose of prednisolone to be reduced.some people are prescribed immunosuppressant medication, such as methotrexate. this is used to reduce or suppress the immune system (the body’s defence against infection and illness). it may be helpful for people with polymyalgia rheumatica who have frequent relapses or don’t respond to normal steroid treatment.your doctor may recommend painkillers, such asparacetamol, ornon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), to help relieve pain and stiffness while your dose of prednisolone is reduced.your gp will ask you to attend regular follow-up appointments to check how well you’re responding to treatment, whether your dose of prednisolone needs to be adjusted, and how well you’re coping with the side effects of the medication.during these appointments, you’ll haveblood teststo check the levels of inflammation inside your body.follow-up appointments are usually recommended every few weeks for the first three months and then at three- to six-monthly intervals after this time.contact your gp if your symptoms return

       " 'Post-polio syndrome': 'post-polio syndrome is a slow progressive condition that affects some people that have hadpolio. it’s not life threatening but it can cause problems in your ability to carry out daily activities.poliois a serious viral infection that used to be common in the uk and worldwide. it’s rarer now because it can be prevented with vaccination.in around 1 in 100 people, the polio virus causes paralysis, which in rare cases can be life threatening.cases of polio in the uk fell dramatically when routine vaccination was introduced in the mid-1950s.the symptoms of post-polio syndrome include:the muscle weakness and atrophy usually affects muscles that were previously affected by polio. sometimes it affects other muscles.this can impact your mobility and your ability to do everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or drying your hair.chronic fatigue is one of the most common and troublesome symptoms of post-polio syndrome. this can be physical fatigue (tiredness) and brain fatigue. brain fatigue can cause problems with concentration, attention and memory.mri scanscan show white spots in the brains of polio survivors which may be related to brain fatigue.the symptoms can gradually get worse over many years. there are supportive treatments that can help with symptoms.although post-polio syndrome is rarely life threatening, some people can develop breathing and swallowing difficulties that can lead to serious problems likechest infections.some people experience a sensitivity to some types of anaesthesia causing them to take longer to recover from having anaesthesia.post-polio syndrome is caused by the polio virus. it only affects people who’ve had polio although it can take 15 – 40 years after the infection for it to develop. it’s not known if there’s anything that can be done to prevent it.the exact cause behind who’ll experience post-polio syndrome after having the polio virus is unclear.it could be because of gradual degeneration (breaking down) of nerve cells (motor neurones) in the brainstem or spinal cord that were damaged by the polio virus. this gradual change explains why it can take years for post-polio syndrome symptoms to appear.during recovery from polio, surviving motor neurone cells grow new nerve ends to connect with other muscle fibres. this helps to regain muscle strength as someone recovers from the polio virus.over time, these new nerve ends put the motor neurone cell under stress. the cells slowly break down, resulting in the loss of muscle strength.people who have had severe polio at a young age or during adolescence (teenage years) might be more likely to experience post-polio syndrome. people who had a more serious infection in early adulthood are also more likely to develop post-polio syndrome.post-polio syndrome is not contagious.it can be difficult to diagnose post-polio syndrome. there are no specific tests for it, and it can be mistaken for other conditions.your gp might suspect post-polio syndrome if: you had polio followed by a long period of stable symptoms (usually 15 years) your symptoms have developed graduallythe symptoms of post-polio syndrome are slow and progressive. the sudden appearance of symptoms is more likely to be caused by something else. a prolonged period of bed rest as a result of another illness or serious injury can trigger post-polio syndrome symptoms.there are some tests that can be done to rule out conditions with similar symptoms.you might be offeredblood testsand scans of your spine.other tests that might be offered include:

following:exercise can help slow down the progressive muscle weakness that post-polio syndrome causes. however, being active can become difficult because your symptoms might become worse after exercise or activity. any exercise should be pain free because too much exercise can cause more damage. you should pace yourself to avoid becoming exhausted from exercise.your healthcare team might suggest you try using pacing techniques. this might involve: prioritising tasks finding different ways of doing tasks which prevent pain or exhaustion getting help from others to do particularly exhausting tasks taking regular breaks and having rest periods regularly throughout your day doing some regular gentle exercise that you can gradually build up and stopping before you become exhaustedpacing can help you prevent becoming worn out. it can help to space out activities throughout the day to allow for rest periods where you can recover in between.making effective and efficient use of your muscles and strength in this way can help them to last longer.medication to relieve pain might be used in addition to pacing techniques. your healthcare team might suggest over the counter painkillers like aspirin,paracetamoloribuprofen. other stronger anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates might be considered too depending on individual needs.talk to your gp if you’re taking over the counter medicines as they shouldn’t be used long term. they can cause complications like stomach ulcers if taken over a long period of time.your healthcare team or gp might suggest medication like gabapentin or pregabalin for your pain if over the counter medications aren’t working.when taking medication for your pain, you might not feel the damage being caused to your muscles and joints

others don’t.read more about thecauses of ptsd.people who repeatedly experience traumatic situations such as severe neglect, abuse or violence may be diagnosed with complex ptsd.complex ptsd can cause similar symptoms to ptsd and may not develop until years after the event. it’s often more severe if the trauma was experienced early in life as this can affect a child’s development.read more

assessment and treatment.ptsd can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event.any treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and how soon they occur after the traumatic event. any of the following treatment options may be recommended: watchful waiting – monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse without treatment. psychotherapy– such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (emdr). antidepressants– such as paroxetine or mirtazapine.read more abouttreating ptsd.the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) can have a significant impact on your day-to-day life.in most cases, the symptoms develop during the first month after a traumatic event. however, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear.some people with ptsd experience long periods when their symptoms are less noticeable, followed by periods where they get worse. other people have constant, severe symptoms.the specific symptoms of ptsd can vary widely between individuals, but generally fall into the categories described below.re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of ptsd. this is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event in the form of: flashbacks nightmares repetitive and distressing images or sensations physical sensations – such as pain, sweating, nausea or tremblingsome people have constant negative thoughts about their experience, repeatedly asking themselves questions that prevent them from coming to terms with the event.for example, they may wonder why the event happened to them and if they could have done anything to stop it, which can lead to feelings of guilt or shame.trying to avoid being reminded of the traumatic event is another key symptom of ptsd. this usually means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience.many people with ptsd try to push memories of the event out of their mind, often distracting themselves with work or hobbies.some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all. this is known as emotional numbing. this can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn, and they may also give up pursuing activities they used to enjoy.someone with ptsd may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax. they may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled. this state of mind is known as hyperarousal.hyperarousal often leads to: irritability angry outbursts sleeping problems (insomnia) difficulty concentratingmany people with ptsd also have a number of other problems, including: other mental health problems – such asdepression, anxiety orphobias self-harming or destructive behaviour – such as drug misuse oralcohol misuse other physical symptoms – such asheadaches, dizziness, chest pains andstomach achesptsd sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.ptsd can affect children as well as adults. children with ptsd can have similar symptoms to adults, such as having trouble sleeping and upsetting nightmares.like adults, children with ptsd may also lose interest in activities they used to enjoy and may have physical symptoms such as headaches andstomach aches.however, there are some symptoms that are more specific to children with ptsd, such as: bedwetting being unusually anxious about being separated from a parent or other adult re-enacting the traumatic event(s) through their playit’s normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these improve naturally over a few weeks.you should visit your gp if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome.your gp will want to discuss your symptoms with you in as much detail as possible. they’ll ask whether you’ve experienced a traumatic event in the recent or distant past and whether you’ve re-experienced the event through flashbacks or nightmares.your gp can refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you’d benefit from treatment. seetreating ptsdfor more information.post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) can develop after a very stressful, frightening or distressing event, or after a prolonged traumatic experience.types of events that can lead to ptsd include: serious road accidents violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect witnessing violent deaths military combat being held hostage terrorist attacks natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis a diagnosis of a life-threatening condition an unexpected severe injury or death of a close family member or friendptsd isn’t usually related to situations that are simply upsetting, such as divorce, job loss or failing exams.ptsd develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. it isn’t fully understood why some people develop the condition while others don’t. however, certain factors appear to make some people more likely to develop ptsd.if you’ve haddepressionor anxiety in the past, or you don’t receive much support from family or friends, you’re more susceptible to developing ptsd after a traumatic event.there may also be a genetic factor involved in ptsd. for example, having a parent with a mental health problem is thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.although it’s not clear exactly why people develop ptsd, a number of possible reasons have been suggested. these are described below.one suggestion is that the symptoms of ptsd are the result of an instinctive mechanism intended to help you survive further traumatic experiences.for example, the flashbacks many people with ptsd experience may force you to think about the event in detail so you’re better prepared if it happens again. the feeling of being “on edge” (hyperarousal) may develop to help you react quickly in another crisis.however, while these responses may be intended to help you survive, they’re actually very unhelpful in reality because you can’t process and move on from the traumatic experience.studies have shown that people with ptsd have abnormal levels of stress hormones.normally, when in danger, the body produces stress hormones such as adrenaline to trigger a reaction in the body. this reaction, often known as the “fight or flight” reaction, helps to deaden the senses and dull pain.people with ptsd have been found to continue to produce high amounts of fight or flight hormones even when there’s no danger. it’s thought this may be responsible for the numbed emotions and hyperarousal experienced by some people with ptsd.in people with ptsd, parts of the brain involved in emotional processing appear different in brain scans.one part of the brain responsible for memory and emotions is known as the hippocampus. in people with ptsd, the hippocampus appears smaller in size. it’s thought that changes in this part of the brain may be related to fear and anxiety, memory problems and flashbacks.the malfunctioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and nightmares from being properly processed, so the anxiety they generate doesn’t reduce over time.treatment of ptsd results in proper processing of the memories so, over time, the flashbacks and nightmares gradually disappear.the main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) are psychotherapy and medication.traumatic events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and seeking professional help is often the only way of effectively treating ptsd.it’s possible for ptsd to be successfully treated many years after the traumatic event occurred, which means it’s never too late to seek help.before having treatment for ptsd, a detailed assessment of your symptoms will be carried out to ensure treatment is tailored to your individual needs.your gp will often carry out an initial assessment, but you’ll be referred to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment if you’ve had symptoms of ptsd for more than four weeks or your symptoms are severe.there are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have ptsd, such as: a psychologist – an expert in how the mind works a community psychiatric nurse – a nurse who specialises in mental healthcare a psychiatrist – a mental health specialist who diagnoses and treats mental health conditionsif you have mild symptoms of ptsd, or you’ve had symptoms for less than four weeks, an approach called watchful waiting may be recommended.watchful waiting involves carefully monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse. it’s sometimes recommended because 2 in every 3 people who develop problems after a traumatic experience get better within a few weeks without treatment.if watchful waiting is recommended, you should have a follow-up appointment within one month.if you have ptsd that requires treatment,psychotherapyis usually recommended first. a combination of psychotherapy and medication may be recommended if you have severe or persistent ptsd.psychotherapy is a type of therapy often used to treat emotional problems and mental health conditions such as ptsd,depression,anxietyandobsessive compulsive disorder.the treatment is carried out by trained mental health professionals who listen to you and help you come up with effective strategies to resolve your problems.the main types of psychotherapy used to treat people with ptsd are described below.cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) is a type of therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think and act.trauma-focused cbt uses a range of psychological treatment techniques to help you come to terms with the traumatic event.for example, your therapist may ask you to confront your traumatic memories by thinking about your experience in detail. during this process your therapist helps you cope with any distress you feel, while identifying any unhelpful thoughts or misrepresentations you have about the experience.your therapist can help you gain control of your fear and distress by changing the negative way you think about your experience. for example, feeling you’re to blame for what happened or fear that it may happen again.you may also be encouraged to gradually restart any activities you’ve avoided since your experience, such as driving a car if you had an accident.you’ll usually have 8-12 weekly sessions of trauma-focused cbt, although fewer may be needed. sessions usually last for around 60-90 minutes.eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (emdr) is a relatively new treatment which has been found to reduce the symptoms of ptsd.it involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of your therapist’s finger, while recalling the traumatic incident. other methods may include the therapist tapping their finger or playing a tone.it’s not clear exactly how emdr works but it may help you to change the negative way you think about a traumatic experience.you may also be offered group therapy as some people find it helpful to speak about their experiences with other people who also have ptsd. group therapy can be used to teach you ways to manage your symptoms and help you understand the condition.there are also a number of charities which provide counselling and support groups for ptsd. for example: combat stress– a military charity specialising in helping ex-servicemen and women rape crisis– a charity providing a range of services for women and girls who have experienced abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault victim support– providing support and information to victims or witnesses of crime cruse– a uk charity providing support and information for people who have experiencedbereavementantidepressantssuch as paroxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, amitriptyline or phenelzine are sometimes used to treat ptsd in adults.of these medications, paroxetine and sertraline are the only ones licensed specifically for the treatment of ptsd. however, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and phenelzine have also been found to be effective and may be recommended as well.however, these medications will only be used if: you choose not to have trauma-focused psychological treatment psychological treatment wouldn’t be effective because there’s an ongoing threat of further trauma (such as domestic violence) you’ve gained little or no benefit from a course of trauma-focused psychological treatment you have an underlying medical condition, such as severe depression, that significantly affects your ability to benefit from psychological treatmentamitriptyline or phenelzine will usually only be used under the supervision of a mental health specialist.antidepressants can also be prescribed to reduce any associated symptoms of depression and anxiety and to help with sleeping problems. however, they’re not usually prescribed for people younger than 18 unless recommended by a specialist.if medication for ptsd is effective, it’s usually be continued for a minimum of 12 months before being gradually withdrawn over the course of four weeks or longer. if a medication isn’t effective at reducing your symptoms, your dosage may be increased.before prescribing a medication, your doctor should inform you about possible side effects you may have while taking it, along with any possible withdrawal symptoms when the medication is withdrawn.for example, common side effects of paroxetine include feeling sick, blurred vision, constipation and diarrhoea.possible withdrawal symptoms associated with paroxetine include sleep disturbances, intense dreams, anxiety and irritability. withdrawal symptoms are less likely if the medication is reduced slowly.for children and young people with ptsd, trauma-focused cbt is usually recommended.this normally involves a course of 8-12 sessions that have been adapted to suit the child’s age, circumstances and level of development. where appropriate, treatment includes consulting with and involving the child’s family.treatment with medication isn’t usually recommended for children and young people with ptsd.complex ptsd may be diagnosed in adults or children who have repeatedly experienced traumatic events, such as violence, neglect or abuse.complex ptsd is thought to be more severe if: the traumatic events happened early in life the trauma was caused by a parent or carer the person experienced the trauma for a long time the person was alone during the trauma there is still contact with the person responsible for the traumaas it may take years for the symptoms of complex ptsd to be recognised, a child’s development, including their behaviour and self-confidence, can be altered as they get older.adults with complex ptsd may lose their trust in people and feel separated from others.the symptoms of complex ptsd are similar tosymptoms of ptsdbut may include: feelings of shame or guilt difficulty controlling your emotions periods of losing attention and concentration – this is known as dissociation physical symptoms – such as headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches cutting yourself off from friends and family relationship difficulties destructive or risky behaviour – such as self-harm,alcohol misuseor drug abuse suicidalthoughtsone of the key symptoms of complex ptsd is losing trust in people. if possible, people with complex ptsd are recommended to slowly start doing regular activities such as: finding friends getting a job regular exercise taking on hobbiesit’s important to try and develop some feelings of trust. it may take some time, but a trusting relationship with a therapist will help treat complex ptsd.treatment from a therapist may be given in three stages, described below.one of the first steps in treating complex ptsd may involve speaking with a therapist to learn how to control feelings of distrust and lose the feeling of being ‘disconnected’ from friends and family.certain techniques, known as ‘grounding’ techniques, may be able to help you separate an abusive or traumatic past from the present. the aim is to make the past seem less frightening and reduce the amount of flashbacks you experience.with time, you can begin to experience less anxiety and learn to cope with daily life.trauma-focused therapy may include: certain types ofpsychotherapy cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (emdr)these treatments may help you to control any distressing thoughts but must be approached carefully to avoid making the situation worse.the final stage is to begin to use these skills and techniques to develop better relationships with other people.medication, such asantidepressants, may still be recommended if psychotherapy isn’t possible or you feel unsafe.you can read more information about complex ptsd onthe royal college of psychiatrists website.if you think you’re experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) or complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cptsd), it’s important for you to visit your gp and discuss your concerns. the ptsd and cptsd self-help guide can help with managing symptoms while you wait for an assessment by your gp or a mental health professional.this guide aims to help you: consider

       " 'Postnatal depression': 'postnatal depression is a type of depression. many parents experience it after having a baby.it’s a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 mothers within a year of giving birth. it can also affect fathers and partners, although this is less common.with the right support, which can include self-help strategies and therapy, most people make a full recovery.postnatal depression affects everyone differently. it can start at any point in the first year after giving birth. it can continue from depression in pregnancy. it may develop suddenly or gradually.many people feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. this is often called the ‘baby blues’ and is so common that it’s considered normal. the baby blues don’t last for more than 2 weeks after giving birth.if your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression.the main symptoms of postnatal depression include:these symptoms can affect your day-to-day life and your relationships with your baby, family and friends. you think you have postnatal depressiondon’t struggle on alone and hope the problem will go away. it can take a lot longer to feel better if it’s not addressed.postnatal depression can develop gradually and it can be hard to recognise. some parents may avoid talking to family and friends about how they’re feeling. this may be because they worry they’ll be judged for not coping or not appearing happy.signs for partners, family and friends to look out for in new parents include: frequently crying for no obvious reason having difficulty bonding with their baby getting no pleasure from playing with them or feeling no good as a parent withdrawing from contact with other people speaking negatively all the time and claiming that they’re hopeless neglecting themselves, like not washing or changing their clothes losing all sense of time, like being unaware whether 10 minutes or 2 hours have passed losing their sense of humour constantly worrying that something is wrong with their baby, regardless of reassurance from othersif you think someone you know is depressed, encourage them to talk about their feelings. this could be to talk to you, a friend, their gp or their health visitor.the cause of postnatal depression isn’t completely clear. some of the factors it has been associated with include: a history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life or during pregnancy having no close family or friends to support you a poor relationship with your partner recent stressful life events, like a bereavement experiencing the ‘baby blues’even if you don’t have any of these symptoms, having a baby is a life-changing event that can sometimes trigger depression.it often takes time to adapt to becoming a new parent. looking after a small baby can be stressful and exhausting.postnatal depression can be lonely, distressing and frightening. but, support and treatments are available. with the right treatment and support, most people make a full recovery, although it can take time.talk to your gp about the pros and cons of different treatments so you can decide together what’s best for you.your gp might also want to check your physical health to see if there are any problems that may need to be addressed as well. for example, you may be anaemic after giving birth. this could add to any feelings of depression you might have.psychological therapies are usually the first treatment recommended for postnatal depression.guided self-help involves working through a book or an online course. you can do this on your own or with some help from a therapist.it focusses on the issues you might be facing, with practical advice on how to deal with them.the courses typically last 9 to 12 weeks.cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) is a type of talking therapy. it’s based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour.cbt aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave in a more positive way.cbt can be carried out either one-to-one with a therapist or in a group. treatment will often last 3 to 4 months.interpersonal therapy (ipt) involves talking to a therapist about the problems you’re experiencing.it aims to identify problems in your relationships with family, friends or partners. it then looks at how they might relate to your feelings of depression.treatment also usually lasts 3 to 4 months.antidepressantsmay be recommended if: you have moderate or severe depression you don’t want to try psychological treatment psychological treatment doesn’t help you have mild postnatal depression and a previous history of depressionthey can help ease symptoms like: low mood irritability lack of concentration sleeplessnessthis helps you to function normally and helps you cope better with your new baby.antidepressants usually need to be taken for at least a week before the benefit starts to be felt. this means it’s important to keep taking them even if you don’t notice an improvement straight away. you’ll usually need to take them for around 6 months after you begin to feel better. if you stop too early, your depression may return.if you’re breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about suitable medicines. some types of antidepressants are safe to take while breastfeeding.your doctor should explain any risks of taking antidepressants. you should be offered the type with the least risk for you and your baby.there are many things you can try yourself to improve your symptoms and help you cope. talk to your partner, friends and family to help them understand how you’re feeling talk to your loved ones about what they can do to support you accept help from others when it’s offered ask your loved ones if they can help look after the baby and do tasks like housework, cooking and shopping make time for yourself – try to do activities that you find relaxing and enjoyable rest when you can – although it can be difficult when you’re looking after a baby, try to sleep whenever you get the chance followgood sleeping habits ask your partner to help with the night-time work exercise regularly – this has been shown to help boost mood in people with mild depression eat regular,healthy meals do not go for long periods without eating do not drink alcohol or take drugs, as this can make you feel worseask your health visitor about support services in your area. they may be able to put you in touch with a social worker, counsellor or local support group. it can be reassuring to meet other people who are going through something similar.find postnatal depression support and information in your areayou might be referred to aspecialist

       " 'Pressure ulcers': 'pressure ulcers are an injury that breaks down the skin and underlying tissue. they are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure.they are sometimes known as “bedsores” or “pressure sores”.pressure ulcers can range in severity from patches of discoloured skin to open wounds that expose the underlying bone or muscle.read more about thesymptoms of pressure ulcers.pressure ulcers can develop when a large amount of pressure is applied to an area of skin over a short period of time. they can also occur when less pressure is applied over a longer period of time.the extra pressure disrupts the flow of blood through the skin. without a blood supply, the affected skin becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming.pressure ulcers tend to affect people with health conditions that make it difficult to move, especially those confined to lying in a bed or sitting for prolonged periods of time.conditions that affect the flow of blood through the body, such astype 2 diabetes, can also make a person more vulnerable to pressure ulcers.learn more about thecauses of pressure ulcers.it’s estimated that just under half a million people in the uk will develop at least 1 pressure ulcer in any given year. this is usually people with an underlying health condition – for example, around 1 in 20 people who are admitted to hospital with a sudden illness will develop a pressure ulcer.people over 70 years old are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers, as they are more likely to have mobility problems and ageing skin.treatment for pressure ulcers includes the use of dressings, creams and gels designed to speed up the healing process and relieve pressure. surgery is sometimes recommended for the most serious cases.for some people, pressure ulcers are an inconvenience that require minor nursing care. for others, they can be serious and lead to life-threatening complications, such asblood poisoningor gangrene.read more about thecomplications of pressure ulcers.pressure ulcers can be unpleasant, upsetting and challenging to treat. therefore, a range of techniques is used to prevent them developing in the first place. these include: regularly changing a person’s position using equipment to protect vulnerable parts of the body – such as specially designed mattresses and cushionsread abouttreating pressure ulcersandpreventing pressure ulcersfor more information.unfortunately, even with the highest standards of care, it’s not always possible to prevent pressure ulcers in particularly vulnerable people.the parts of the body most at risk of developing pressure ulcers are those that are not covered by a large amount of body fat and are in direct contact with a supporting surface, such as a bed or a wheelchair.for example, if you are unable to get out of bed, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on your: shoulders or shoulder blades elbows back of your head rims of your ears knees, ankles, heels or toes spine tail bone (the small bone at the bottom of your spine)if you are a wheelchair user, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on: your buttocks the back of your arms and legs the back of your hip bonehealthcare professionals use several grading systems to describe the severity of pressure ulcers. the most common is the european pressure ulcer advisory panel (epuap) grading system. the higher the grade, the more severe the injury to the skin and underlying tissue.a grade 1 pressure ulcer is the most superficial type of ulcer. the affected area of skin appears discoloured – it is red in white people, and purple or blue in people with darker-coloured skin. grade 1 pressure ulcers do not turn white when pressure is placed on them. the skin remains intact, but it may hurt or itch. it may also feel either warm and spongy, or hard.in grade 2 pressure ulcers, some of the outer surface of the skin (the epidermis) or the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) is damaged, leading to skin loss. the ulcer looks like an open wound or a blister.in grade 3 pressure ulcers, skin loss occurs throughout the entire thickness of the skin. the underlying tissue is also damaged, although the underlying muscle and bone are not. the ulcer appears as a deep, cavity-like wound.a grade 4 pressure ulcer is the most severe type of pressure ulcer. the skin is severely damaged and the surrounding tissue begins to die (tissue necrosis). the underlying muscles or bone may also be damaged.people with grade 4 pressure ulcers have a high risk of developing a life-threatening infection.pressure ulcers are caused by sustained pressure being placed on a particular part of the body.this pressure interrupts the blood supply to the affected area of skin. blood contains oxygen and other nutrients that are needed to help keep tissue healthy. without a constant blood supply, tissue is damaged and will eventually die.the lack of blood supply also means that the skin no longer receives infection-fighting white blood cells. once an ulcer has developed, it can become infected by bacteria.people with normal mobility do not develop pressure ulcers, as their body automatically makes hundreds of regular movements that prevent pressure building up on any part of their body.for example, you may think that you are lying still when asleep, but you may shift position up to 20 times a night.pressure ulcers can be caused by: pressure from a hard surface – such as a bed or wheelchair pressure that is placed on the skin through involuntary muscle movements – such as muscle spasms moisture – which can break down the outer layer of the skin (epidermis)the time it takes for a pressure ulcer to form will depend on: the amount of pressure how vulnerable a person’s skin is to damagegrade 3 or 4 pressure ulcers can develop quickly. for example, in susceptible people, a full-thickness pressure ulcer can sometimes develop in just 1 or 2 hours. however, in some cases, the damage will only become apparent a few days after the injury has occurred.there are several factors that increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. these include: mobility problems – anything that affects your ability to move some or all of your body poor nutrition – for your skin to remain healthy, it requires nutrients that can only be supplied by eating a nutritious diet an underlying health condition that disrupts your blood supply or makes your skin more vulnerable to injury and damage being over 70 years old urinary incontinenceand/orbowel incontinence serious mental health conditionsthese are discussed in more detail below.possible reasons for having a mobility problem are: having a spinal cord injury that causes some or all of your limbs to be paralysed brain damage caused by an event such as astrokeorsevere head injury, which results in paralysis having a condition that is causing progressive damage to the nerves your body uses to move parts of the body – such asalzheimer’s disease,multiple sclerosis (ms)orparkinson’s disease having severe pain that makes it difficult to move some or all of your body having a fractured or broken bone recovering from the effects of surgery being in acoma having a condition that makes it difficult to move your joints and bones – such asrheumatoid arthritisreasons that your diet may lack nutrition include: anorexia nervosa– a mental health condition where a person has an unhealthy obsession with maintaining a low body weight dehydration– you do not have enough fluids in your body dysphagia– difficulty swallowing foodhealth conditions that can make you more vulnerable to pressure ulcers include: type 1 diabetesandtype 2 diabetes– the high levels of blood sugar associated with diabetes can disrupt normal blood flow peripheral arterial disease (pad) – blood supply in the legs becomes restricted due to a build-up of fatty substances in the arteries heart failure– previous damage to the heart means it is no longer able to pump enough blood around the body kidney failure– the kidney loses most or all of its functions, which can lead to a build-up of dangerous toxins (poisons) in the blood that can cause tissue damage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)– a collection of lung diseases; the low levels of oxygen in the blood associated with copd can make the skin more vulnerable to damagethere are several reasons why ageing skin is more vulnerable to pressure ulcers. these include: with age, the skin loses some of its elasticity (stretchiness), which makes it more vulnerable to damage reduced blood flow to the skin, due to the effects of ageing the amount of fat under the skin tends to decrease as people get olderboth urinary incontinence (inability to control your bladder) and bowel incontinence (inability to control your bowels) can cause certain areas of the skin to become moist and vulnerable to infection. this can cause pressure ulcers to form.people with severe mental health conditions such asschizophrenia(a condition where people have problems telling the difference between reality and imagination) or severe depression have an increased risk of pressure ulcers for a number of reasons. these include: their diet tends to be poor they often have other physical health conditions, such as diabetes or incontinence they may neglect their personal hygiene, making their skin more vulnerable to injury and infectionpressure ulcers are easily diagnosed by looking at them. however, health professionals prefer to prevent ulcers developing in the first place, so it’s important to assess a person’s risk of developing them.as part of the risk assessment process, the following will be considered: your general health your ability to move whether you have any problems that may affect your posture whether you have any symptoms that may indicate an infection your mental health whether you have had pressure ulcers in the past whether you haveurinary incontinenceorbowel incontinence your diet how well your blood circulation system is workingas part of the risk assessment, you may be referred for blood and urine tests.blood testscan be a good way of assessing your general state of health and whether your diet is providing enough nutrition.urine tests can be used to check how well your kidneys are working and whether you have aurinary tract infection, which can be a cause for concern if you are incontinent or if you have had spinal damage.if you are thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, but you are not staying in a hospital or care home, you may be advised to regularly check for early signs of the condition.look out for areas of discolouration and patches of skin that feel unusually spongy or tough to the touch. use a mirror to check parts of your body that can be difficult to see, such as your back or buttocks. contact your gp or your healthcare team if you notice any signs of damage.treatment for pressure ulcers can vary, depending on the grade of the ulcer. treatment options may include regularly changing your position, or using special mattresses and dressings to relieve pressure or protect the skin. in some cases, surgery may be needed.pressure ulcers are a complex health problem arising from many interrelated factors. therefore, your care may be provided by a team comprising different types of healthcare professionals. this type of team is sometimes known as a multidisciplinary team (mdt).your mdt may include: a tissue viability nurse (a nurse who specialises in wound care and prevention) a social worker a physiotherpist anoccupational therapist a dietitian medical and surgical experts with experience in pressure ulcer managementit’s important to avoid putting pressure on areas that are vulnerable to pressure ulcers or where pressure ulcers have already formed. moving and regularly changing your position helps to prevent pressure ulcers developing and relieves the pressure on the ulcers that have developed.after your risk assessment is completed, your care team will draw up a “repositioning timetable”, which states how often you need to be moved. for some people, this may be as often as once every 15 minutes. others may need to be moved only once every 2 hours.the risk assessment will also consider the most effective way of avoiding putting any vulnerable areas of skin under pressure whenever possible.you may also be given training and advice about: correct sitting and lying positions how you can adjust your sitting and lying position how often you need to move or be moved how best to support your feet how to maintain good posture the special equipment you should use and how to use itthere are a range of special mattresses and cushions that can relieve pressure on vulnerable parts of the body. your care team will discuss the types of mattresses and cushions most suitable for you.those thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, or who have pre-existing grade 1 or 2 pressure ulcers, usually benefit from a specially designed foam mattress, which relieves the pressure on their body.people with a grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcer will require a more sophisticated mattress or bed system. for example, there are mattresses that can be connected to a constant flow of air, which is automatically regulated to reduce pressure as and when required.specially designed dressings and bandages can be used to protect pressure ulcers and speed up the healing process. examples of these types of dressings include: hydrocolloid dressings – these contain a special gel that encourages the growth of new skin cells in the ulcer, while keeping the surrounding healthy area of skin dry alginate dressings – these are made from seaweed and contain sodium and calcium, which are known to speed up the healing processtopical preparations, such as creams and ointments, can be used to help speed up the healing process and prevent further tissue damage.if you have a pressure ulcer, you will not routinely be prescribed antibiotics. these are usually only prescribed to treat an infected pressure ulcer and prevent the infection from spreading.antiseptic cream may also be applied directly to pressure ulcers to clear out any bacteria that may be present.certain dietary supplements, such as protein, zinc and vitamin c, have been shown to accelerate wound healing.if your diet lacks these vitamins and minerals, your skin may be more vulnerable to developing pressure ulcers. as a result of this, you may be referred to a dietitian so that a suitable dietary plan can be drawn up for you.in some cases, it may be necessary to remove dead tissue from the ulcer to help stimulate the healing process. this procedure is known as debridement.if there is a small amount of dead tissue, it may be possible to remove it using specially designed dressings and paste. larger amounts of dead tissue may be removed using mechanical means. some mechanical debridement techniques include: cleansing and pressure irrigation – where dead tissue is removed using high-pressure water jets ultrasound – dead tissue is removed using low-frequency energy waves laser – dead tissue is removed using focused beams of light surgical debridement – dead tissue is removed using surgical instruments, such as scalpels and forcepsalocal anaestheticwill be used to numb the area of skin and tissue around the ulcer so that debridement does not cause any pain or discomfort.maggot therapy, also known as larvae therapy, is an alternative method of debridement. maggots are ideal for debridement because they feed on dead and infected tissue without touching healthy tissue. they also help to fight infection by releasing substances that kill bacteria and stimulate the healing process.during maggot therapy, the maggots are mixed into a wound dressing and the area is covered with gauze. after a few days, the dressing is taken off and the maggots are removed.many people may find the idea of maggot therapy off-putting, but research has found that it is often more effective than more traditional methods of debridement.it’s not always possible for a grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcer to heal. in such cases, surgery will be required to seal the wound and prevent any further tissue damage occurring.surgical treatment involves cleaning the wound and closing it by bringing together the edges of the wound (direct closure), or by using tissue moved from a nearby part of the body (flap reconstruction).pressure ulcer surgery can be challenging, especially because most people who have the procedure are already in a poor state of health. there is a risk of a large number of possible complications occurring after surgery, including: infection tissue death of the implanted flap muscle weakness blisters(small pockets of fluid that develop inside the skin) recurrence of the pressure ulcers blood poisoning infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) internal bleeding abscesses (painful collections of pus that develop inside the body) deep vein thrombosis(a blood clot that develops inside the veins of the leg)despite the risks, surgery is often a necessity to prevent life-threatening complications, such asblood poisoningand gangrene (the decay or death of living tissue).even with the best possible medical care, complications can arise from grade 3 or grade 4 pressure ulcers and can occasionally be life-threatening.these complications are discussed below.infection can spread from the site of the pressure ulcer to a deeper layer of skin. this type of infection is called cellulitis. it causes symptoms of pain and redness, plus swelling of the skin. it will need to be treated with a course of antibiotics.read more information aboutcellulitis.left untreated, there is a risk that the infection can spread to the blood (see below) or the underlying bone or joint. in rare cases, where pressure ulcers involve the lower back, tail bone and spine, the pressure ulcer can spread to the membranes that surround the spine and brain. this is known asmeningitis.if a person with a weak immune system has a pressure ulcer that becomes infected, there is a risk that the infection will spread into their blood and other organs. this is known as blood poisoning or septicaemia.in the most serious cases of blood poisoning, damage to multiple organs can lead to a large drop in blood pressure, known asseptic shock, which can be fatal. symptoms include cold skin and an increased heart beat.blood poisoning is a medical emergency. it requires immediate treatment in an intensive care unit (icu), so that the functions of the body can be supported while the infection is treated with antibiotics or antiviral medication.read more information aboutblood poisoning.infection can also spread from a pressure ulcer into underlying joints (septic arthritis) and bones (osteomyelitis).both of these infections can damage the cartilage, tissue and bone. they may also affect the joints and limbs.antibiotics are required to treat bone and joint infections. in the most serious of cases, infected bones and joints may need to be surgically removed.necrotising fasciitis, commonly known as “flesh-eating” bacteria, is a serious skin infection that causes rapid tissue death. it can occur when a pressure ulcer becomes infected with a particular type of bacteria, such as group a streptococci.emergency treatment is required. it involves a combination of antibiotics and surgical debridement of the dead tissue.gas gangrene is a serious but rare form of infection that occurs when a pressure ulcer becomes infected with the clostridium bacteria. the bacteria thrive in environments where there is little or no oxygen. they produce gases and release dangerous toxins. symptoms of gas gangrene include severe pain and rapid swelling of the skin.gas gangrene requires immediate treatment with surgical debridement. in the most serious of cases, it may be necessary to amputate the affected body part to prevent the gangrene from spreading to the rest of the body.as part of your treatment plan, your care team will discuss with you the best way to prevent pressure ulcers. this will be based on your individual circumstances.however, you may find that the general advice outlined below is helpful.making regular and frequent changes to your position is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. if a pressure ulcer has already developed, regularly changing position will help to avoid putting further pressure on it, and give the wound the best chance of healing.as a general rule, wheelchair users will need to change their position at least once every 15 to 30 minutes. people who are confined to bed will need to change their position at least once every 2 hours.once you have developed a pressure ulcer, it’s important that you minimise or avoid putting any further pressure on it to give the wound the best chance of healing.if you are unable to change position yourself, a carer or relative will need to assist you. for more information and advice about positional changes, read abouttreating pressure ulcers.eating a healthy, balanced diet that contains an adequate amount of protein and a good variety of vitamins and minerals can help prevent skin damage and speed up the healing process. you may be referred to a dietitian so that a dietary plan can be drawn up for you.if you currently have a reduced appetite due to a pre-existing health condition, the following advice may be useful: try eating smaller meals throughout the day, rather than 2 or 3 larger meals. set a timetable for when you should eat, rather than waiting until you feel hungry. this should ensure that you receive the necessary nutrition. avoid drinking large amounts of fluids just before you are about to eat, as this will make you feel fuller than you actually are. if you find swallowing difficult, try drinking specially made nutritional drinks or puréed foods and soups. if you are a vegetarian, it’s important to eat high-protein alternatives to meat. cheese, yoghurt, peanut butter, custard, beans and nuts are all good sources of protein.read more information abouthealthy eatingfor more advice.if you have known risk factors for pressure ulcers, it’s important that you check your skin on a daily basis for any signs of pressure ulcers, such as discoloured areas of skin. this is particularly important if you have an underlying condition, such as nerve damage or diabetes, which may dampen or numb feelings of pain in certain parts of your body.you can use a mirror to check the parts of your body that are difficult to see, such as your bottom and the heels of your feet. if you notice any damage, report it to your care team. if you are at home, contact your gp or community nurse. if you are in hospital or a nursing home, inform one of your nurses or carers.if you are a smoker, giving up is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. smoking reduces the levels of oxygen in your blood. it also weakens your immune system, which increases your risk of developing pressure ulcers.read aboutquitting smokingfor further information and advice about giving up smoking.',\n",
       " 'Prostate cancer': 'prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and anyone with a prostate in the uk.prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have it for many years.symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis).when this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied.these symptoms shouldn’t be ignored, but they do not mean you definitely have prostate cancer. it is more likely that they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as bph orprostate enlargement).read more about thesymptoms of prostate cancerthe prostate is a small gland in the pelvis. about the size of a satsuma, it’s located between the penis and the bladder and surrounds the urethra.the main function of the prostate is to help in the production of semen. it produces a thick white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen.the causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. however, certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition.the chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. most cases develop in men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or older.for reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in men and anyone with a prostate of african-caribbean african descent. it’s less common in men and anyone with a prostate of asian descent.men and anyone with a prostate who have first-degree male relatives (such as a father or brother) affected by prostate cancer are also at a slightly increased risk.read more about thecauses of prostate cancerthere is no single test for prostate cancer. all the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you.the most commonly used tests for prostate cancer areblood tests, a physical examination of your prostate (known as adigital rectal examination or dre) and abiopsy.the blood test, known as a prostate-specific antigen (psa) test, measures the level of psa and may help detect early prostate cancer. men and anyone with a prostate are not routinely offered psa tests to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable.this is because the psa blood test is not specific to prostate cancer. psa can be raised due to a large non-cancerous growth of the prostate (bph), a urinary tract infection or inflammation of the prostate, as well as prostate cancer. raised psa levels also cannot tell a doctor whether a man has life-threatening prostate cancer or not. this means a raised psa can lead to unnecessary tests and treatment.however, you can ask to be tested for prostate cancer once the benefits and risks have been explained to you.read more aboutdiagnosing prostate cancerandpsa screening for prostate cancerin many cases, treatment is not immediately necessary.if the cancer is at an early stage and not causing symptoms, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ or ‘active surveillance’ may be adopted. this involves carefully monitoring your condition.some cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages. treatments include surgically removing the prostate,radiotherapyand hormone therapy.some cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread. if the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, typically the bones, it cannot be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms.all treatment options carry the risk of significant side effects, includingerectile dysfunctionandurinary incontinence. for this reason, many people choose to delay treatment until there is a risk the cancer might spread.newer treatments, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) or cryotherapy, aim to reduce these side effects. some hospitals may offer them as an alternative to surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy. however, the long-term effectiveness of these treatments are not yet known.read more abouttreating prostate canceras prostate

and anyone with a prostate of asian descent family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase the risk of you developing it; having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of developing prostate cancer obesity – there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer exercise – men and anyone with a prostate who regularly exercises have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer; a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancerin addition, some research has shown that prostate cancer rates appear to be lower in men and anyone with a prostate who eat foods containing certain nutrients including lycopene, found in cooked tomatoes and other red fruit, and selenium, found in brazil nuts. however, more research is needed.read further information:

further tests for suspected prostate cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.psa is a protein produced by the prostate gland. all men and anyone with a prostate have a small amount of psa in their blood, and it increases with age.prostate cancer can increase the production of psa, and so a psa test looks for raised levels of psa in the blood that may be a sign of the condition in its early stages.however, psa testing is not a specific test for prostate cancer. most men and anyone with a prostate who has prostate cancer will not have a raised psa level. most people with a raised psa level will not have cancer, as psa levels rise in all men and anyone with a prostate as they get older.read more aboutpsa screening for prostate cancerthe next step is a dre, which can be done by your gp.during a dre, your gp will insert a lubricated and gloved finger into your rectum. the rectum is close to your prostate gland, so your gp can check to feel if the surface of the gland has changed. this will feel a little uncomfortable, but should not be painful.prostate cancer can make the gland hard and bumpy. however, in most cases, the cancer causes no changes to the gland and a dre may not be able to detect the cancer.dre is useful in ruling outprostate enlargementcaused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, as this causes the gland to feel firm and smooth.your gp will assess your risk of having prostate cancer based on a number of factors, including your psa levels, the results of your dre, and your age, family history and ethnic group. if you are at risk, you should be referred to hospital to discuss the options of further tests.the most commonly used test is a transrectal ultrasound-guidedbiopsy(trus). a biopsy may also be taken during acystoscopy examinationor through the skin behind the testicles (perineum).during a trus biopsy, an ultrasound probe (a machine that uses sound waves to build a picture of the inside of your body) is inserted into your rectum. this allows the doctor or specialist nurse to see exactly where to pass a needle through the wall of your rectum to take small samples of tissue from your prostate.the procedure can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful, so you may be given alocal anaestheticto minimise any discomfort. as with any procedure, there may be complications, including bleeding and infection.although it is more reliable than a psa test, the trus biopsy can have problems. it can miss up to 1 in 5 cancers, because the location of the cancer is unknown when it is carried out. the doctors can see the prostate using the ultrasound scan, but not the tumour(s) if they are present.you may need another biopsy if your symptoms persist, or your psa level continues to rise. your doctor may request an mri scan of the prostate before another biopsy.the trus biopsy can also find small low-risk cancers that do not need treatment, but may cause you anxiety. many people often choose to undergo surgery or radiotherapy that may not benefit them but causes side effects, such as incontinence anderectile dysfunction.the samples of tissue from the biopsy are studied in a laboratory. if cancerous cells are found, they can be studied further to see how quickly the cancer will spread. this process is known as ‘staging and grading’ and helps doctors to decide which treatment is the most appropriate.read further information: cancer research uk:the stages of prostate cancer macmillan:grading and staging of prostate cancerif there is a significant chance the cancer has spread from your prostate to other parts of the body, further tests may be recommended.these include: amagnetic resonance imaging (mri)orcomputerised tomography (ct)scan – these scans build a detailed picture of the inside of your body an isotope bone scan – this can tell if the cancer has spread to your bones; a small amount of radiation dye is injected into the vein and collects in parts of the bone where there are any abnormalitiesread further information: cancer research uk:prostate cancer teststhere is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the uk. this is because it has not been proved that the benefits would outweigh the risks.routinely screening all men and anyone with a prostate to check their prostate-specific antigen (psa) levels is a controversial subject in the international medical community. there are several reasons for this: psa tests are unreliable and can suggest prostate cancer when no cancer exists (a false-positive result) – this means that many men often have invasive and sometimes painful biopsies for no reason the psa test can find aggressive prostate cancer that needs treatment, but it can also find slow-growing cancer that may never cause symptoms or shorten life – some men and anyone with a prostate may therefore face difficult decisions about treatment treating prostate cancer in its early stages can be beneficial in some cases but the side effects of the various treatments are potentially so serious that men may choose to delay treatment until it is absolutely necessary although screening has been shown to reduce a man’s chance of dying from prostate cancer, it would mean many people receive treatment unnecessarilymore research is needed to determine whether a screening programme would provide men and anyone with a prostate with more benefit than harm.one european study showed deaths from prostate cancer could be reduced by 20% if there was a screening programme, but this needs to be balanced against the harms of: overdiagnosis – people being diagnosed with a cancer that will never cause symptoms or death during their lifetime overtreatment – people being treated unnecessarily for tumours that would be unlikely to be harmfulas there are many reasons why psa levels may be high at any one time, researchers are trying to make the psa test, or a variation of it, more accurate. this includes looking at how psa levels change over time and comparing the psa level to prostate size.researchers are also looking at whether new imaging tests, such as mri scans, or other blood and urine tests, can be used to decide which people with an elevated psa should have a biopsy.instead of a national screening programme, there is an informed choice programme called prostate cancer risk management for healthy men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or over who ask their gp about psa testing. it aims to give men and anyone with a prostate good information on the pros and cons of a psa test.if you’re aged 50 or over with a prostate and decide to have your psa levels tested after talking to your gp, they will be able to arrange for it to be carried out for free on the nhs.if results show you have a raised level of psa, your gp may suggest further tests.because the results of the psa test are not as reliable as doctors would like, other tests and investigations are needed to diagnose prostate cancer.a psa test cannot identify prostate cancer on its own, and changes in psa levels alone are not a good reason to start treatment.if you are thinking about asking for a psa test, it is important that you first discuss whether it is right for you with your gp so you understand what the results might mean.theprostate cancer risk management programmehas information on the risks and benefits of the psa test to help you decide whether or not to have it.doctors will use the results of your prostate examination, biopsy and scans to identify the ‘stage’ of your prostate cancer (how far the cancer has spread). the stage of the cancer will determine which types of treatments will be necessary.a widely used method of staging is a number staging system. the stages are: stage 1 – the cancer is very small and completely within the prostate gland stage 2 – the cancer is within the prostate gland, but is larger stage 3 – the cancer has spread from the prostate and may have grown into the tubes that carry semen stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes or another part of the body, including the bladder, rectum or bones; about 20 to 30% of cases are diagnosed at this stageif prostate cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the chances of survival are generally good.read further information: cancer research uk:the stages of prostate cancerwatchful waiting is often recommended for older men and anyone with a prostate when it is unlikely that the cancer will affect your natural life span.if the cancer is in its early stages and not causing symptoms, you may decide to delay treatment, and wait to see if any symptoms of progressive cancer develop. if this happens, pain medication and hormone medication to control prostate cancer are usually used.watchful waiting may also be recommended for people with a higher risk of prostate cancer if: your general health means you are unable to receive any form of treatment your life expectancy means you will die with the cancer rather than from itin this case, hormone treatment may be started if there are symptoms caused by the prostate cancer.active surveillance aims to avoid unnecessary treatment of harmless cancers, while still providing timely treatment for men and anyone with a prostate who needs it.when they are diagnosed, around half to two-thirds of men and anyone with a prostate with low-risk prostate cancer do not need treatment. surveillance is a safe strategy that provides a period of observation to gather extra information over time to see whether the disease is changing.active surveillance involves you having regular psa tests and often several biopsies to ensure any signs of progression are found as early as possible. sometimes, mri scans may also be carried out. if these tests reveal the cancer is changing or progressing, you can then make a decision about further treatment.about 1 in 3 people who undergo surveillance will later have treatment. this does not mean they made the wrong initial decision. good evidence shows that active surveillance is safe over an average of 6 years. men undergoing active surveillance will have delayed any treatment-related side effects, and those who eventually need treatment will be reassured that it was necessary.a radical prostatectomy is the surgical removal of your prostate gland. this treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer.like any operation, this surgery carries some risks, and there may be some side effects: some people have problems withurinary incontinence– this can range from leaking small drips of urine, to leaking larger amounts but this usually clears up within 3 to 6 months of the operation some men have problems getting an erection (erectile dysfunction)– this sometimes improves with time, but around half will have long-term problems in extremely rare cases, problems arising after surgery can be fatalfor many men and anyone with a prostate, having a radical prostatectomy will get rid of the cancer cells. however, for around 1 in 3 people, the cancer cells may not be fully removed, and the cancer cells may return sometime after the operation.radiotherapy after prostate removal surgery may increase the chances of a cure, although research is still being carried out into when it should be used after surgery.after a radical prostatectomy, you will no longer ejaculate during sex. this means that you will not be able to have a child through sexual intercourse. you may want to ask your doctors about storing a sperm sample before the operation, so it can be used later for in vitro fertilisation (ivf).read further information: macmillan:surgery for early prostate cancerradiotherapyinvolves using radiation to kill cancerous cells. this treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer. radiotherapy can also be used to slow the progression of metastatic prostate cancer and relieve symptoms.radiotherapy is normally given as an outpatient at a hospital near you. it is done in short sessions for 5 days a week, for 4 to 8 weeks. there are short-term and long-term side effects associated with radiotherapy.you may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of successful treatment. hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning.short-term effects of radiotherapy can include: discomfort around the rectum and anus (the opening through which stools pass out of your body) diarrhoea loss of pubic hair tiredness cystitis– an inflammation of the bladder lining, which can cause you to urinate frequently; urination may be painfulpossible long-term side effects can include: an inability to obtain an erection urinary incontinence back passage problems (diarrhoea, bleeding, discomfort)as with radical prostatectomy, there is a 1 in3 chance the cancer will return. in these cases, medication is usually used to control the cancer instead of surgery. this is because there is a higher risk of complications from surgery in men and anyone with a prostate who have previously had radiotherapy.some hospitals now offer new minimally invasive treatments if radiotherapy fails to work, sometimes as part of a clinical trial. these new treatments are called high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) and cryotherapy. these treatments have fewer side effects, but the long-term outcomes are not yet known.read further information: macmillan:radiotherapy for early prostate cancerbrachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where the radiation dose is delivered inside the prostate gland. it is also known as internal or interstitial radiotherapy.the radiation can be delivered using a number of tiny radioactive seeds that are surgically implanted into the tumour. this is called low dose-rate brachytherapy.the radiation can also be delivered through hollow, thin needles placed inside the prostate. this is called high dose-rate brachytherapy.this method has the advantage of delivering a high dose of radiation to the prostate, while minimising damage to other tissues. however, the risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary problems is the same as with radiotherapy, although the risk of bowel problems is slightly lower.read further information: cancer research uk:internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) for prostate cancerhormone therapy is often used in combination with radiotherapy. for example, you may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of a successful treatment. hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning.hormone therapy alone should not normally be used to treat localised prostate cancer in people who are fit and willing to receive surgery or radiotherapy. this is because it does not cure the cancer on its own. hormone therapy can be used to slow the progression of advanced prostate cancer and relieve symptoms.hormones control the growth of cells in the prostate. in particular, prostate cancer needs the hormone testosterone to grow. the purpose of hormone therapy is to block the effects of testosterone, either by stopping its production or by stopping your body being able to use testosterone.hormone therapy can be given as: injections to stop your body making testosterone, called luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) agonists tablets to block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone, called anti-androgen treatment combined lhrh and anti-androgen treatmentthe main side effects of hormone treatment are caused by their effects on testosterone. they usually go away when treatment stops. they include loss of sex drive anderectile dysfunction(this is more common with lhrh agonists than anti-androgens).other possible side effects include: hot flushes sweating weight gain swelling and tenderness of the breastsan alternative to hormone therapy is to surgically remove the testicles, called orchidectomy. the operation does not cure prostate cancer, but by removing the testosterone, it controls the growth of the cancer and its symptoms.read

bladder to your penis) and pieces of the prostate are removed.this is carried out undergeneral anaestheticor a spinal anaesthetic (epidural).this is done to relieve pressure from the urethra to treat any problematic symptoms you may have with urination. it does not cure the cancer.read more information abouttransurethral resection of the prostate (turp).hifu is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate.an ultrasound probe inserted into the rectum releases high-frequency sound waves through the wall of the rectum. these sound waves kill cancer cells in the prostate gland by heating them to a high temperature.the risk of side effects from hifu is usually lower than other treatments.however, possible effects can include impotence (in 5 to 10 in every 100) or urinary incontinence (in less than 1 in every 100). back passage problems are rare.fistulas (an abnormal channel between the urinary system and rectum) are also rare, affecting less than 1 in every 500. this is because the treatment targets the cancer area only and not the whole prostate.however, hifu treatment is still going through clinical trials for prostate cancer. in some cases, doctors can carry out hifu treatment outside of clinical trials. hifu is not widely available and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven.read further information: cancer research uk:high intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) for prostate cancercryotherapy is a method of killing cancer cells by freezing them. it is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate gland.tiny probes called cryoneedles are inserted into the prostate gland through the wall of the rectum. they freeze the prostate gland and kill the cancer cells, but some normal cells also die.the aim is to kill cancer cells while causing as little damage as possible to healthy cells. the side effects of cryotherapy can include: erectile dysfunction – this can affect between 2 and 9 in every 10 incontinence – this affects less than 1 in 20it is rare for cryotherapy to cause rectal problems or fistulas.cryotherapy is still undergoing clinical trials for prostate cancer. in some cases, doctors can carry out cryotherapy treatment outside of clinical trials. it is not widely available and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven.if the cancer has reached an advanced stage, it is no longer possible to cure it. however, it may be possible to slow its progression, prolong your life and relieve symptoms.treatment options include: radiotherapy hormone treatment chemotherapyif the cancer has spread to your bones, medicines called bisphosphonates may be used. bisphosphonates help reduce bone pain and bone loss.chemotherapyis mainly used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic prostate cancer) and which is not responding to hormone therapy.chemotherapy destroys cancer cells by interfering with the way they multiply. chemotherapy does not cure prostate cancer, but can keep it under control and reduce symptoms (such as pain) so everyday life is less affected.the main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their effects on healthy cells, such as immune cells. they include infections, tiredness, hair loss, sore mouth, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. many of these side effects can be prevented or controlled with other medicines, which your doctor can prescribe for you.steroid tablets are used when hormone therapy no longer works because the cancer is resistant to it. this is called hormone-refractory cancer.steroids can be used to try to shrink the tumour and stop it from growing. the most effective steroid treatment is dexamethasone.there are a number of new medications that could be used if hormones and chemotherapy fail. your medical team can tell you if these are suitable and available for you.nice has recently issued guidance on medications called abiraterone and enzalutamide.read the nice guidelines on: enzalutamide for metastatic

give you support and pain relief. this is calledpalliative care. support is also available for your family and friends.if you have no symptoms, prostate cancer should have little or no effect on your everyday activities. you should be able to work, care for your family, carry on your usual social and leisure activities, and look after yourself. however, you may be understandably worried about your future. this may make you feelanxiousordepressed, and affect your sleep.if your prostate cancer progresses, you may not feel well enough to do all the things you used to. after an operation or other treatment, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, you will probably feel tired and need time to recover.if you have advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, you may have symptoms that slow you down and make it difficult to do things. you may have to reduce your working hours or stop working altogether.whatever stage your prostate cancer has reached, try to give

       " 'Psoriasis': 'psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales.these patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. most people are only affected with small patches. in some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore.psoriasis affects around 2% of people in the uk. it can start at any age, but most often develops in adults under 35 years old. the condition affects men and women equally.the severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. for some people it’s just a minor irritation, but for others it can have a major impact on their quality of life.psoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe.read more about thesymptoms of psoriasis.people with psoriasis have an increased production of skin cells.skin cells are normally made and replaced every 3 to 4 weeks, but in psoriasis this process only lasts about 3 to 7 days. the resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis.although the process isn’t fully understood, it’s thought to be related to a problem with the immune system. the immune system is your body’s defence against disease and infection, but for people with psoriasis, it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake.psoriasis can run in families, although the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear.many people’s psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a “trigger”. possible triggers of psoriasis include an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines.the condition isn’t contagious, so it can’t be spread from person to person.read more about thecauses of psoriasis.a gp can often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin.in rare cases, a small sample of skin, called abiopsy, will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. this determines the exact type of psoriasis and rules out other skin disorders, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis,lichen planus, lichen simplex and pityriasis rosea.you may be referred to a dermatologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe.if your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specialises in arthritis). you may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such asrheumatoid arthritis, and x-rays of the affected joints may be taken.there’s no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches.in most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin d analogues ortopical corticosteroids. topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin.if these aren’t effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light.in severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. these are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body.read more abouttreating psoriasis.although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.for example, some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance. it’s also quite common to develop tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. this is known as psoriatic arthritis.speak to your gp or healthcare team if you have psoriasis and you have any concerns about your physical and mental wellbeing. they can offer advice and further treatment if necessary. there are also support groups for people with psoriasis, such asthe psoriasis association, where you can speak to other people with the condition.read more aboutliving with psoriasis.you can find support and information from organisations like: changing faces– a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice the psoriasis association– provides support groups for people with psoriasis where you can speak to other people with the conditionpsoriasis typically causes patches of skin that are dry, red and covered in silver scales. some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness.there are several different types of psoriasis. many people have only one form of psoriasis at a time, although 2 different types can occur together. one type may change into another type, or become more severe.most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping.you should see your gp if you think you may have psoriasis.this is the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases. its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, which are covered in silver scales. they normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. the plaques can be itchy, sore or both. in severe cases, the skin around your joints may crack and bleed.this can occur on parts of your scalp or on the whole scalp. it causes red patches of skin covered in thick silvery-white scales. some people find scalp psoriasis extremely itchy, while others have no discomfort. in extreme cases it can cause hair loss, although this is usually only temporary.in about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. nails can often become loose and separate from your nail bed. in severe cases, your nails may crumble.guttate psoriasis causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp. there’s a good chance that guttate psoriasis will disappear completely after a few weeks, but some people go on to develop plaque psoriasis.this type of psoriasis sometimes occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers.this affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. it can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather.pustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body.this causes pustules on a wide area of skin, which develop very quickly. the pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. the pustules may reappear every few days or weeks in cycles. during the start of these cycles, von zumbusch psoriasis can cause fever, chills, weight loss and fatigue.this causes pustules to appear on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. the pustules gradually develop into circular brown, scaly spots, which then peel off. pustules may reappear every few days or weeks.this causes pustules to appear on your fingers and toes. the pustules then burst, leaving bright red areas that may ooze or become scaly. these may lead to painful nail deformities.erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. this can cause intense itching or burning. erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection,dehydration,heart failure, hypothermia andmalnutrition.psoriasis occurs when skin cells are replaced more quickly than usual. it’s not known exactly why this happens, but research suggests it’s caused by a problem with the immune system.your body produces new skin cells in the deepest layer of skin. these skin cells gradually move up through the layers of skin until they reach the outermost level. then they die and flake off. this whole process normally takes around 3 to 4 weeks.in people with psoriasis, this process only takes about 3 to 7 days. as a result, cells that aren’t fully mature build up rapidly on the surface of the skin, causing red, flaky, crusty patches covered with silvery scales.your immune system is your body’s defence against disease and it helps fight infection. one of the main types of cell used by the immune system is called a t-cell.t-cells normally travel through the body to detect and fight invading germs such as bacteria, but in people with psoriasis they start to attack healthy skin cells by mistake. this causes the deepest layer of skin to produce new skin cells more quickly than usual, which in turn triggers the immune system to produce more t-cells.it’s not known what exactly causes this problem with the immune system, although certain genes and environmental triggers may play a role.psoriasis runs in families. 1 in 3 people with psoriasis has a close relative with the condition.however, the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. research studies have shown many different genes are linked to the development of psoriasis. it’s likely that different combinations of genes may make people more vulnerable to the condition. however, having these genes doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll develop it.many people’s psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger. knowing your triggers may help you to avoid a flare-up. common triggers include: an injury to your skin, such as a cut, scrape, insect bite or sunburn (this is known as the koebner response) drinking excessive amounts of alcohol smoking stress hormonal changes, particularly in women (for example, during puberty and themenopause) certain medicines such as lithium, some antimalarial medicines, anti-inflammatory medicines includingibuprofen, ace inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure) andbeta blockers(used to treat congestive heart failure) throat infections – in some people, usually children and young adults, a form of psoriasis called guttate psoriasis develops after a streptococcal throat infection (although most people who have streptococcal throat infections don’t develop psoriasis) other immune disorders, such ashiv, which cause psoriasis to flare up or to appear for the first timepsoriasis isn’t contagious, so it can’t be spread from person to person.treatments are determined by the type and severity of your psoriasis and the area of skin affected. your doctor will probably start with a mild treatment, such as topical creams (which are applied to the skin), and then move on to stronger treatments if necessary.a wide range of treatments are available for psoriasis, but identifying which treatment is most effective can be difficult. talk to your doctor if you feel a treatment isn’t working or you have uncomfortable side effects.treatments fall into 3 categories: topical – creams and ointments that are applied to your skin phototherapy – your skin is exposed to certain types of ultraviolet light systemic– oral and injected medications that work throughout the entire bodyoften, different types of treatment are used in combination.your treatment for psoriasis may need to be reviewed regularly. you may want to make a care plan (an agreement between you and your health professional) as this can help you manage your day-to-day health.the various treatments for psoriasis are outlined below. you can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for psoriasis, allowing you to compare your treatment options.topical treatments are usually the first treatments used for mild to moderate psoriasis. these are creams and ointments you apply to affected areas.some people find that topical treatments are all they need to control their condition, although it may take up to 6 weeks before there’s a noticeable effect.if you have scalp psoriasis, a combination of shampoo and ointment may be recommended.emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. if you have mild psoriasis, an emollient is probably the first treatment your gp will suggest.the main benefit of emollients is to reduce itching and scaling. some topical treatments are thought to work better on moisturised skin. it’s important to wait at least half an hour before applying a topical treatment after an emollient.emollients are available as a wide variety of products and can be bought over the counter from a pharmacy or prescribed by your gp, nurse or health visitor.steroid creams or ointments (topical corticosteroids)are commonly used to treat mild to moderate psoriasis in most areas of the body. the treatment works by reducing inflammation. this slows the production of skin cells and reduces itching.topical corticosteroids range in strength from mild to very strong. only use topical corticosteroids when recommended by your doctor. stronger topical corticosteroids can be prescribed by your doctor and should only be used on small areas of skin or on particularly thick patches. overusing topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning.vitamin d analogue creams are commonly used along with or instead of steroid creams for mild to moderate psoriasis affecting areas such as the limbs, trunk or scalp. they work by slowing the production of skin cells. they also have an anti-inflammatory effect.examples of vitamin d analogues are calcipotriol, calcitriol and tacalcitol. there are very few side effects, as long as you don’t use more than the recommended amount.calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are ointments or creams that reduce the activity of the immune system and help to reduce inflammation. they’re sometimes used to treat psoriasis affecting sensitive areas (such as the scalp, the genitals and folds in the skin) if steroid creams aren’t effective.these medications can cause skin irritation or a burning and itching sensation when they’re started, but this usually improves within a week.coal tar is a thick, heavy oil and is probably the oldest treatment for psoriasis. how it works isn’t exactly known, but it can reduce scales, inflammation and itchiness. it may be used to treat psoriasis affecting the limbs, trunk or scalp if other topical treatments aren’t effective.coal tar can stain clothes and bedding, and has a strong smell. it can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).dithranol has been used for over 50 years to treat psoriasis. it has been shown to be effective in suppressing the production of skin cells and has few side effects. however, it can burn if too concentrated.it’s typically used as a short-term treatment for psoriasis affecting the limbs or trunk under hospital supervision, as it stains everything it comes into contact with, including skin, clothes and bathroom fittings. it’s applied to your skin (while wearing gloves) and left for 10 to 60 minutes before being washed off.dithranol can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).phototherapy uses natural and artificial light to treat psoriasis. artificial light therapy can be given in hospitals and some specialist centres, usually under the care of a dermatologist. these treatments aren’t the same as using a sunbed.ultraviolet b (uvb) phototherapy uses a wavelength of light that is invisible to human eyes. the light slows down the production of skin cells and is an effective treatment for some types of psoriasis that haven’t responded to topical treatments. each session only takes a few minutes, but you may need to go to hospital 2 or 3 times a week for 6 to 8 weeks.for this treatment, you’ll first be given a tablet containing compounds called psoralens, or psoralen may be applied directly to the skin. this makes your skin more sensitive to light. your skin is then exposed to a wavelength of light called ultraviolet a (uva). this light penetrates your skin more deeply than ultraviolet b light.this treatment may be used if you have severe psoriasis that hasn’t responded to other treatment. side effects of the treatment include nausea, headaches, burning and itchiness. you may need to wear special glasses for 24 hours after taking the tablet to prevent the development of cataracts. long-term use of this treatment isn’t encouraged, as it can increase your risk of developing skin cancer.combining phototherapy with other treatments often increases its effectiveness. some doctors use uvb phototherapy in combination with coal tar, as the coal tar makes the skin more receptive to light. combining uvb phototherapy with dithranol cream may also be effective (this is known as ingram treatment).if your psoriasis is severe or other treatments haven’t worked, you may be prescribed systemic treatments by a specialist. systemic treatments are treatments that work throughout the entire body.these medications can be very effective in treating psoriasis, but they all have potentially serious side effects. all the systemic treatments for psoriasis have benefits and risks. before starting treatment, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and any risks associated with them.there are 2 main types of systemic treatment, called non-biological (usually given as tablets or capsules) and biological (usually given as injections). these are described in more detail below.methotrexate can help to control psoriasis by slowing down the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. it’s usually taken once a week.methotrexate can cause nausea and may affect the production of blood cells. long-term use can cause liver damage. people who have liver disease shouldn’t take methotrexate, and you shouldn’t drink alcohol when taking it.methotrexate can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it’s important that women use contraception and don’t become pregnant while they take this drug and for 3 months after they stop. methotrexate can also affect the development of sperm cells, so men shouldn’t father a child during treatment and for 3 weeks afterwards.ciclosporin is a medicine that suppresses your immune system (immunosuppressant). it was originally used to prevent transplant rejection, but has proved effective in treating all types of psoriasis. it’s usually taken daily.ciclosporin increases your chances of kidney disease and high blood pressure, which will need to be monitored.acitretin is an oral retinoid that reduces the production of skin cells. it’s used to treat severe psoriasis that hasn’t responded to other non-biological systemic treatments. it’s usually taken daily.acitretin has a wide range of side effects, including dryness and cracking of the lips, dryness of the nasal passages and, in rarer cases,hepatitis.acitretin can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it’s important that women use contraception and don’t become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 2 years after they stop taking it. however, it’s safe for a man taking acitretin to father a baby.biological treatments reduce inflammation by targeting overactive cells in the immune system. these treatments are usually used if you have severe psoriasis that hasn’t responded to other treatments, or if you can’t use other treatments.etanercept is injected twice a week and you’ll be shown how to do this. if there’s no improvement in your psoriasis after 12 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.the main side effect of etanercept is a rash where the injection is given. however, as etanercept affects the whole immune system, there’s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infection. if you hadtuberculosisin the past, there’s a risk it may return. you’ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.adalimumab is injected once every 2 weeks and you’ll be shown how to do this. if there’s no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.adalimumab can be harmful to a developing baby, so it’s important that women use contraception and don’t become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 5 months after the treatment finishes.the main side effects of adalimumab include headaches, a rash at the injection site and nausea. however, as adalimumab affects the whole immune system, there’s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. you’ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.infliximab is given as a drip (infusion) into your vein at the hospital. you’ll have 3 infusions in the first 6 weeks, then 1 infusion every 8 weeks. if there’s no improvement in your psoriasis after 10 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.the main side effect of infliximab is a headache. however, as infliximab affects the whole immune system, there’s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. you’ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.ustekinumab is injected at the beginning of treatment, then again 4 weeks later. after this, injections are every 12 weeks. if there’s no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.the main side effects of ustekinumab are a throat infection and a rash at the injection site. however, as ustekinumab affects the whole immune system, there’s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. you’ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.if you have psoriasis, you may find the following advice helpful.self care is an essential part of your daily life. it involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from those involved in your care. self care includes staying fit and maintaining good physical and mental health, preventing illness or accidents, and caring more effectively for minor illnesses and long-term conditions.people with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from self care. they can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, a better quality of life, and be more active and independent. having acare planwill help you manage your treatment so that it fits your lifestyle.it’s important to use your treatment as prescribed, even if your psoriasis improves. continuous treatment can help to prevent flare-ups. if you have any questions or concerns about your treatment or any side effects, talk to your gp or healthcare team.because psoriasis is usually a long-term condition, you may be in regular contact with your healthcare team. discuss your symptoms or concerns with them, as the more the team knows, the more they can help you.people with psoriasis have a slightly higher risk of developingdiabetesandcardiovascular diseasethan the general population, although it’s not known why. regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone, not just people with psoriasis, because they can help to prevent many health problems.eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly can also relieve stress, which may improve your psoriasis.because of the effect that psoriasis can have on physical appearance, low self-esteem and anxiety are common among people with the condition. this can lead todepression, especially if the psoriasis gets worse.your gp or dermatologist will understand the psychological and emotional impact of psoriasis, so talk to them about your concerns or anxieties.some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. this causes tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue, as well as stiffness. it commonly affects the ends of the fingers and toes. in some people, it affects the lower back, neck and knees. most people develop psoriatic arthritis after psoriasis, but about 20% develop it before they’re diagnosed with psoriasis.there’s no single test for psoriatic arthritis. it’s normally diagnosed using a combination of methods, including looking at your medical history, physical examinations, blood tests, x-rays and mri scans. if you have psoriasis, you’ll usually have an annual assessment to look for signs of psoriatic arthritis.if your doctor thinks you have psoriatic arthritis, you’ll usually be referred to a specialist called a rheumatologist, so you can be treated with anti-inflammatory or anti-rheumatic medicines.psoriasis doesn’t affect fertility, and women with psoriasis can have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. some women find their psoriasis improves during pregnancy, but for others it gets worse.talk to your healthcare team if you’re thinking of having a baby. some treatments for psoriasis can be harmful to a developing baby, so use contraception while taking them. this can apply to both men and women, depending on the medication. your healthcare team can suggest the best ways to control your psoriasis before you start trying for a family.many people with psoriasis have found that getting involved in support groups helps them. support groups can increase your self-confidence, reduce feelings of isolation, and give you practical advice about living with the condition.further information and support for psoriasis is available

       " 'Psoriatic arthritis': 'psoriatic arthritis is a type ofarthritisthat develops in some people with the skin conditionpsoriasis. it typically causes affected joints to become inflamed (swollen), stiff and painful.between 20-40% of people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. psoriasis affecting the skin affects around 3% of people.in most cases, people will experience problems with their skin before they notice any symptoms affecting their joints. in a minority of cases, skin problems may develop after or at the same time as joint problems.like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is thought to be a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. it’s not clear why some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis and others don’t.the pain, swelling and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the condition often affects particular areas including the hands feet knees elbows neck and spinetendons can also be involved – in some people they may be the major problem.symptoms usually develop slowly meaning that many people are unaware that they are developing psoriatic arthritis. in rarer cases, symptoms can develop suddenly and without warning.the severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person. some people may have severe problems affecting many joints, whereas others may only notice mild symptoms in one or two joints.there may be times when your symptoms improve and periods when they get worse (known as flare-ups or relapses). some people may reach a point where they have no symptoms at all (known as remission).relapses can be very difficult to predict, but can often be managed with medication when they happen.you should speak to your gp if you experience constant pain, swelling or stiffness in your joints – even if you haven’t been diagnosed with psoriasis.if you have been diagnosed with psoriasis, you should have check-ups at least once a year to monitor your condition. make sure you let your doctor know if you’re experiencing any problems with your joints.if your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment.a rheumatologist will usually be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis if you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, and other types of arthritis – such asrheumatoid arthritisandosteoarthritis– have been ruled out.a number of tests may be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis, includingblood teststo check for signs of inflammation in your body and the presence of certain antibodies found in other types of arthritis, as well asx-raysor scans of your joints.the main aims of treatment will be to relieve your symptoms, slow the progression of the condition and improve your quality of life.for most people, this will involve trying a number of different medications, some of which can also treat the psoriasis. ideally, you should take one medication to treat both your psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis whenever possible.the main medications used to treat psoriatic arthritis are summarised below.your gp may first prescribenon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)to see if they help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.there are two types of nsaids and they work in slightly different ways: traditional nsaids, such asibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac cox-2 inhibitors (often called coxibs), such as celecoxib or etoricoxiblike all medications, nsaids can have side-effects, but your doctor will take precautions to reduce the risk of these, such as prescribing the lowest dose necessary to control your symptoms for the shortest time possible.if side-effects do happen, they usually affect the stomach and intestines, and can includeindigestionandstomach ulcers. a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) that helps protect your stomach by reducing the amount of acid it produces will therefore often be prescribed alongside nsaids.if nsaids alone are not helpful, some of the medications below may be recommended.like nsaids,corticosteroidscan help reduce pain and swelling.if you have a single inflamed or swollen joint, your doctor may inject the medication directly into the joint. this can offer rapid relief with minimal side effects, and the effect can last from a few weeks to several months.corticosteroids can also be taken as a tablet, or as an injection into the muscle, to help when lots of joints are inflamed. however, doctors are generally cautious about this because the medication can cause significant side effects if used in the long term, and psoriasis can flare up when you stop using it.disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) are medications that work by tackling the underlying causes of the inflammation in your joints. they can help to ease your symptoms and slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis. the earlier you start taking a dmard, the more effective it will be.psoriatic arthritis can be treated with a variety of dmards including: methotrexate sulphasalazine leflunomide cyclosporin antimalarials (such as hydroxychloroquine) azathioprine apremilastyour rheumatologist will discuss the most appropriate choice of dmard for you.it can take several weeks or months to notice a dmard working. therefore, it’s important to keep taking the medication, even if it doesn’t seem to be working at first.dmard therapy is monitored according to guidelines such as british society for rheumatology (bsr).biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for psoriatic arthritis. you may be offered one of these treatments if: your psoriatic arthritis has not responded to at least two different types of dmard you are not able to be treated with at least two different types of dmard because of other problems e.g. other diseases.biological drugs work by directly blocking the chemicals in the blood, skin and joints that switch the immune system on, leading it to attack the lining of your joints and your skin.some of the biological medicines you may be offered are adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab injections. see our page ontreating psoriasisfor more information about these medications.  newer biological drugs include ustekinumab.the most common side-effect of biological treatments is a reaction in the area of skin where the medication is injected, such as redness, swelling or pain, although these reactions aren’t usually serious.however, biological treatments can sometimes cause other side-effects, including problems with your liver, kidneys or blood count, so you’ll usually need to have regular blood or urine tests to check for these.biological treatments can make you more likely to develop infections, so you should tell your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of an infection, such as asore throat, a high temperature (fever), urinary problems ordiarrhoea.biological treatments usually take between 2 and 6 months to take effect.if it’s effective, the medication can be continued. otherwise, your doctor may suggest stopping the medication or swapping to an alternative biological treatment.there isn’t enough scientific research evidence to say that complementary therapies, such as balneotherapy (bathing in water containing minerals), works in treating psoriatic arthritis.there is also not enough evidence to support taking any kind of food supplement as treatment.complementary therapies can sometimes react with other treatments, so you should talk to your gp, specialist or pharmacist if you’re thinking of using any.as with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions – such ascardiovascular disease (cvd)– if you have psoriatic arthritis. cvd is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such asheart diseaseandstroke.your doctor should carry out tests each year (such as blood pressure and cholesterol tests) so they can check whether you have cvd and offer additional treatment, if necessary.you can also help yourself by: having a good balance betweenrest and regular physical activity losing weight, if you’re overweight not smoking only drinking moderate amounts ofalcoholread more aboutliving with psoriasisandpreventing cvd.psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the eyes, such as conjunctivitis and iritis.if psoriatic arthritis affects your skin and joints, you may notice changes in your nails such as: dents pits discolouration loosening from the nail bedthis is less common if only your skin is affected.as well as your gp and a rheumatologist, you may also be cared for by: a specialist nurse – who will often be your first point of contact with your specialist care team a dermatologist (skin specialist) – who will be responsible for treating your psoriasis symptoms a physiotherapist – who can devise an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile an occupational therapist – who can identify any problems you have in everyday activities and find ways to overcome or manage these a psychologist – who can offer psychological support if you need it a podiatrist who can offer assessment and advice on foot problems if affected during the course of psa.like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse.in severe cases, there is a risk of the joints becoming permanently damaged or deformed, which may require surgical treatment.however, with an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it’s possible to slow down the progression of the condition and minimise or prevent permanent damage to the joints.

       " 'Psychosis': 'psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. this might involve hallucinations or delusions.the two mainsymptoms of psychosisare: hallucinations – where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren’t there; a common hallucination is hearing voices delusions – where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue – for example, thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill youthe combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can often severely disrupt perception, thinking, emotion, and behaviour.experiencing the symptoms of psychosis is often referred to as having a psychotic episode.psychosis isn’t a condition in itself – it’s triggered by other conditions.it’s sometimes possible to identify the cause of psychosis as a specific mental health condition, such as: schizophrenia– a condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions bipolar disorder– a mental health condition that affects mood; a person with bipolar disorder can have episodes ofdepression(lows) and mania (highs) severe depression – some people with depression also have symptoms of psychosis when they’re very depressedpsychosis can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, or physical conditions, such asparkinson’s disease, abrain tumour, or as a result of drug misuse oralcohol misuse.how often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause.for example, schizophrenia can be long term, but most people can make a good recovery and about a quarter only have a single psychotic episode. episodes related to bipolar disorder usually resolve, but may recur.read more about thecauses of psychosis.you should see your gp immediately if you’re experiencing psychotic episodes. it’s important psychosis is treated as soon as possible as early treatment usually has better long-term outcomes.your gp will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse. they may ask you some questions to help determine what’s causing your psychosis. for example, they may ask you: whether you’re taking any medication whether you’ve been taking illegal substances how your mood has been – for example, whether you’ve been depressed how you’ve been functioning day-to-day – for example, whether you’re still working whether you have a family history of mental health conditions – such as schizophrenia about your hallucinations – such as whether you’ve heard voices about your delusions – such as whether you feel people are controlling you whether you have any other symptomsyour gp should refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment.read more aboutdiagnosing psychosis.treatment for psychosis involves using a combination of: antipsychotic medication – which can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis psychological therapies – the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) has proved successful in helping people with schizophrenia; in appropriate cases, family therapy has been shown to reduce the need for hospital treatment in people with psychosis social support – support with social needs, such as education, employment, or accommodationmost people with psychosis who get better with medication need to continue taking it for at least a year. some people need to take medication long term to prevent symptoms recurring.if a person’s psychotic episodes are severe, they may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.read more about thetreatment of psychosis.people with psychosis often have a lack of insight. they’re unaware that they’re thinking and acting strangely.because of their lack of insight, it’s often down to the friends, relatives, or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them.if you’re concerned about someone you know and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they’ve previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. if you think the person’s symptoms are placing them at possible risk of harm, you can: take them to the nearest accident and emergency (a&e) department, if they agree call their gp or local out-of-hours gp call 999 and ask for an ambulancepeople with a history of psychosis are much more likely to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both.this may be because these substances can provide short-term symptom relief, although they usually make symptoms worse in the long term.people with psychosis also have a higher than average risk ofsuicide. it’s estimated 1 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt to commit suicide at some point in their life, and 1 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves.side effects can also occur if someone is taking antipsychotics on a long-term basis. weight gain is a common side effect. in rare cases, a person with psychosis may also developtype 2 diabetes.read more about thecomplications of psychosis.someone who develops psychosis will have their own unique set of symptoms and experiences, according to their particular circumstances.however, four main symptoms are associated with a psychotic episode. they are: hallucinations delusions confused and disturbed thoughts lack of insight and self-awarenessthese are outlined in more detail below.hallucinations are where a person perceives something that doesn’t exist in reality. they can occur in all five of the senses: sight – someone with psychosis may see colours and shapes, or people or animals that aren’t there sounds – someone with psychosis may hear voices that are angry, unpleasant or sarcastic touch – a common psychotic hallucination is that you are being touched when there is nobody there smell – usually a strange or unpleasant odour taste – some people with psychosis have complained of having a constant unpleasant taste in their moutha delusion is where a person has an unshakeable belief in something implausible, bizarre, or obviously untrue. paranoid delusion and delusions of grandeur are two examples of psychotic delusions.a person with psychosis will often believe an individual or organisation is making plans to hurt or kill them. this can lead to unusual behaviour. for example, a person with psychosis may refuse to be in the same room as a mobile phone because they believe they are mind control devices.someone with psychosis may also have delusions of grandeur. this is where they believe they have some imaginary power or authority. for example, they may think they’re the president of a country or they have the power to bring people back from the dead.people with psychosis often have disturbed, confused, and disrupted patterns of thought. signs of this include: rapid and constant speech random speech – for example, they may switch from one topic to another mid-sentence a sudden loss in their train of thought, resulting in an abrupt pause in conversation or activitypeople who have psychotic episodes are often totally unaware their behaviour is in any way strange or that their delusions or hallucinations are not real.they may recognise delusional or bizarre behaviour in others, but lack the self-awareness to recognise it in themselves.for example, a person with psychosis being treated in a psychiatric ward may complain that their fellow patients are mentally unwell, while they’re perfectly normal.postnatal psychosis, also called puerperal psychosis, is a severe form ofpostnatal depression, a type of depression some women experience after having a baby.it’s estimated postnatal psychosis affects around 1 in every 1,000 women who give birth. it most commonly occurs during the first few weeks after having a baby.postnatal psychosis is more likely to affect women who already have a mental health condition, such asbipolar disorderorschizophrenia.as well as the symptoms of psychosis, symptoms of postnatal psychosis can also include: a high mood (mania) – for example, talking and thinking too much or too quickly a low mood – for example,depression, lack of energy, loss of appetite, and trouble sleepingpostnatal psychosis is regarded as a medical emergency. contact your gp immediately if you think someone you know may have developed postnatal psychosis. if this isn’t possible, call the nhs 24 ‘111’ service or your local out-of-hours service.if you think there’s an imminent danger of harm, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.the causes of psychosis have three main classifications.they are psychosis caused by: mental (psychological) conditions general medical conditions substances, such as alcohol or drugsthe three classifications are described in more detail below.the following conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people: schizophrenia– a long-term (chronic) mental health condition that causes hallucinations and delusions bipolar disorder– a condition that affects a person’s moods, which can swing from one extreme to another (highs and lows) severestressoranxiety severedepression– feelings of persistent sadness that last for more than six weeks, includingpostnatal depression, which some women experience after having a baby lack of sleepthe underlying psychological cause will often influence the type of psychotic episode someone experiences.for example, a person with bipolar disorder is more likely to have delusions of grandeur, whereas someone with depression or schizophrenia is more likely to developparanoid delusions.the following medical conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in

misuseand drug misuse can trigger a psychotic episode.a person can also experience a psychotic episode if they suddenly stop drinking alcohol or taking drugs after using them for a long time. this is known as withdrawal.it’s also possible to experience psychosis after drinking large amounts of alcohol or if you’re high on drugs.drugs known to trigger psychotic episodes include: cocaine amphetamine (speed) methamphetamine (crystal meth) mephedrone (mcat or miaow) mdma (ecstasy) cannabis lsd (acid) psilocybins (magic mushrooms) ketaminein rare situations, psychosis can also occur as a side effect of some types of medication or as a result of an overdose of that medication.for example, levodopa, a medication used to treatparkinson’s disease, can sometimes cause psychotic episodes. however, any medicine that acts on the brain can cause psychosis with an overdose.never stop taking a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by your gp or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care.see your gp if you’re experiencing psychotic side effects caused by medication.there’s been a great deal of research into how psychosis affects the brain and how changes in the brain can triggersymptoms of psychosis.research has revealed several physical and biological changes occur in the brain during a psychotic episode. grey matter is the part of the brain responsible for processing thoughts.the results ofmagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanshave shown some people with a history of psychosis have less grey matter than most other people. however, it’s not yet fully understood why this is.researchers also believe dopamine plays an important role in psychosis.dopamine is a neurotransmitter, one of many chemicals the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another. it is associated with how we feel whether something is significant, important, or interesting.it’s thought levels of dopamine in the brain become too high in people with psychosis. the excess dopamine interrupts specific pathways in the brain that are responsible for some of its most important functions, such as: memory emotion social behaviour self-awarenessdisruption to these important brain functions may explain the symptoms of psychosis.evidence for the role of dopamine in psychosis comes from several sources, including brain scans and the fact medications known to reduce the effects of dopamine in the brain also reduce the symptoms of psychosis.however, illegal drugs known to increase levels of dopamine in the brain – such as cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines – can trigger psychosis.you should visit your gp if you’re experiencing psychotic episodes.it’s important to speak to your gp as soon as possible as the early treatment of psychosis usually has better long-term outcomes.there’s no test to positively diagnose psychosis. however, your gp will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse.your gp may ask questions to determine the cause of your psychosis. for example, they may ask you: whether you’re taking any medication whether you’ve been taking illegal substances how your moods have been – for example, whether you’ve been depressed how you’ve been functioning day-to-day – for example, whether you’re still working whether you have a family history of mental health conditions, such asschizophrenia about the details of your hallucinations, such as whether you’ve heard voices about the details of your delusions, such as whether you feel people are controlling you about any other symptoms you havethe evidence supporting the early treatment of psychosis means you’re likely to be referred to a specialist urgently. this will either be during or after your first episode of psychosis.who you’re referred to will depend on the services available in your area. you may be referred to: a community mental health team – a team of different mental health professionals who provide support to people with complex mental health conditions a crisis resolution team – a team of different mental health professionals who treat people currently experiencing a psychotic episode who would otherwise require hospitalisation an early intervention team – a team of mental health professionals who work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosisthese teams are likely to include some or all of the following healthcare professionals: a psychologist – a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions a psychiatrist – a qualified medical doctor who has received further training in treating mental health conditions a community mental health nurse – a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditionsyour psychiatrist will carry out a full assessment to help identify and diagnose any underlying mental health condition that could be causing your symptoms. this will help when planning yourtreatment for psychosis.the lack of insight associated with psychosis means people experiencing it aren’t always able to recognise their strange behaviour.they may be reluctant to visit their gp if they believe there’s nothing wrong with them, and you may need to get help for them.someone who has had psychotic episodes in the past may have been assigned a mental health worker, who works in social services, so try to contact them to express your concerns.someone who is having a psychotic episode for the first time may need a friend, relative or someone else close to them to persuade them to visit their gp.if they’re having a psychotic episode that’s rapidly getting worse, you should contact their crisis team or, if the team isn’t available, the duty psychiatrist at their nearest accident and emergency (a&e) department.if a person who is having a psychotic episode refuses to seek help and is believed to present a risk to themselves or others, their nearest relative can request a psychological assessment. yourlocal mental health trustcan advise you about this.if someone has very severe psychosis, they can be compulsorily detained at hospital for assessment and treatment under themental health (scotland) act 2015.treatment for psychosis involves a combination of antipsychotic medicines, psychological therapies, and social support.your treatment is likely to be co-ordinated by a team of mental health professionals working together. if this is your first psychotic episode, you may be referred to an early intervention team.an early intervention team is a team of healthcare professionals set up specifically to work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis.some early intervention teams only focus on a certain age range, such as people who are 14 to 35 years old.depending on your care needs, early intervention teams aim to provide: a full assessment of your symptoms prescriptions for medications psychological services social, occupational, and educational interventionstreatment for psychosis will vary, depending on the underlying cause. you’ll receive specific treatment if you’ve been diagnosed with an underlying mental health condition as well.for example,treatment for bipolar disorderuses a variety of medications, which could include antipsychotics to treat symptoms of mania, lithium and anticonvulsants to help stabilise mood, as well as psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt).treatment for schizophrenia usually involves a combination of antipsychotic medication and social support. cbt or another type ofpsychotherapycalled family therapy are also often used.psychosis related to drug or alcohol intoxication or withdrawal may only require a short course of antipsychotics or tranquillisers, which have a calming effect. referral to an addiction counsellor may then be recommended.antipsychotic medicines, also known as neuroleptics, are usually recommended as the first treatment for psychosis. they work by blocking the effect of dopamine, a chemical that transmits messages in the brain.however, they’re not suitable or effective for everyone, as side effects can affect people differently. in particular, antipsychotics will be monitored closely in people who also haveepilepsy, a condition that causes seizures or fits.people who havecardiovascular disease– conditions that affect the heart, blood vessels, or circulation, such asheart disease– will also be closely monitored.antipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but they may take several days or weeks to reduce other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts.antipsychotics can be taken by mouth (orally) or given as an injection. there are several slow-release antipsychotics, where you only need one injection every two to six weeks.depending on the underlying cause of your psychosis, you may only need to take antipsychotics until your psychosis subsides.however, if you have a condition like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, you may need to take antipsychotics on a long-term basis to prevent further episodes of psychosis.antipsychotics can have side effects, although not everyone will experience them and their severity will differ from person to person.side effects can include: drowsiness – this may affect your ability to drive shaking and trembling restlessness muscle twitches and spasms – where your muscles shorten tightly and painfully blurred vision dizziness constipation loss of sex drive (libido) dry mouthsee the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side effects. in addition, long-term use of antipsychotics can lead to complications like weight gain anddiabetes.read more about thecomplications of psychosis.tell your gp if you have side effects that are becoming particularly troublesome. there may be an alternative antipsychotic medicine you can take.never stop taking medication prescribed for you unless advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care.suddenly stopping prescription medication could trigger a return of your symptoms (relapse). when it’s time for you to stop taking your medication, it will be done gradually and under close observation.psychological treatment can help reduce the intensity and anxiety caused by psychosis. some possible psychological treatments are discussed below.cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) for psychosis is based on an understanding of how people make sense of their experiences and why some people become distressed by them.the aim of cbt is to identify unhelpful thinking patterns and emotions that may be causing your unwanted feelings and behaviours. it’s then possible to learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and balanced thoughts.a cbt therapist may encourage you to consider different ways of understanding what’s happening to you. the aim is to help you achieve goals that are meaningful and important to you, such as reducing your distress, returning to work or university, or regaining a sense of control.family therapy is known to be an effective form of treatment for people with psychosis. it’s a way of helping both you and your family cope with your condition.after having an episode of psychosis, you may rely on your family members for care and support. while most family members are happy to help, the stress of caring for somebody can place a strain on any family.family therapy involves a series of informal meetings that take place over a period of six months. meetings may include: discussing your condition and how it might progress, plus the available treatments exploring ways of supporting someone with psychosis deciding how to solve practical problems caused by psychosis, such as planning how to manage future psychotic episodesif you’re experiencing episodes of psychosis, you may benefit from being around other people who’ve had similar experiences.someone experiencing a psychotic episode may self-harm. suicidal thoughts and an increased risk of suicide are also common.self-harming behaviour is a relatively common complication in people with psychosis. a study found 1 in 10 people with psychosis also had a history of self-harm.the risk of self-harm is thought to be highest in people who are experiencing their first episode of psychosis but aren’t receiving treatment.see your gp if you’re self-harming. you can also call thesamaritanson 08457 90 90 90 for support.if you think a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for signs of unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on the wrists, arms, thighs, and chest. people who self-harm may keep themselves covered up at all times, even in hot weather.a person who’s self-harming may feel deep shame and guilt, or they may feel confused and worried by their own behaviour. it’s important to approach them with care and understanding.they may not want to discuss their self-harming behaviour with you, but you could suggest they speak to their gp or a counsellor on a support helpline.people with psychosis also have an increased risk ofsuicide. it’s estimated 1 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt suicide at some point in their life, and 1 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves.if you’re feeling suicidal, you can: call thesamaritanssupport service on 08457 90 90 90 go toyour nearest accident and emergency (a&e) departmentand tell the staff how you’re feeling contact the nhs 24 ‘111’ service speak to a friend, family member, or someone you trust make an urgent appointment to see your gp, psychiatrist, or care teamread more aboutgetting help if you’re feeling suicidal.if you’re worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, recommend that they contact one or more of the organisations above and encourage them, in a non-judgemental way, to talk about how they’re feeling.if the person has previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such asdepression, you can speak to a member of their care team for help and advice.read more about thewarning signs of suicideandsupporting someone who’s feeling suicidal.using antipsychotics on a medium- to long-term basis can cause a number of complications. some of the more common complications are discussed below.weight gain is a complication of many commonly used antipsychotics. there are two main reasons why weight gain is thought to occur.antipsychotics can: lead to an increase in appetite make you less activeyou’ll probably be advised to take more exercise to help burn off the excess fat.read aboutgetting started with exerciseandhow to lose weight safely.metabolic syndrome is a term describing a number of related conditions linked to weight gain, such as: high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) high cholesterol high blood pressure (hypertension) obesitythese health conditions can also increase your risk of developingtype 2 diabetes,heart diseaseand, most seriously,heart attackorstroke.because of the risk of metabolic syndrome, you’ll usually need to have regularblood testsand blood pressure tests while taking antipsychotics.if your test results show you have an increased risk of developing a condition such as heart disease, a number of preventative treatments, such asstatins, are available to help lower cholesterol levels.tardive dyskinesia (td) is another common complication of long-term antipsychotic use.td is a movement disorder where a person experiences involuntary movements, such as twitching, tics, grimaces, tremors, and spasms. it usually starts in the face and mouth before spreading to the rest of the body.in some cases, stopping taking an antipsychotic will provide relief from td symptoms, but in other cases it makes the symptoms worse.however, stopping medication isn’t always safe and has to be balanced against the risk of having a relapse.in some cases, td can be a permanent condition.there are also a number of treatments that can sometimes improve the symptoms of td, including: clonazepam – a medication used to treatepilepsy, a condition that affects the brain and causes seizures or fits vitamin e supplements – check with the doctor in charge of your care before taking vitamin supplements

       " 'Rare tumours': 'more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.rare cancers in children make up fewer than 1 in 30 of all childhood cancers and can broadly be grouped as:the causes of most rare childhood cancers are unknown. but if other family members have had particular types of cancer, this may sometimes suggest that there is an inherited faulty gene in the family. if this is a possibility, your child’s specialist will talk to you about it.rare cancers are treated with the same treatments used for other childhood cancers. this includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. your child may need a combination of these treatments.usually an operation is done to remove all or as much of the cancer as possible. other treatments, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, may be given after or sometimes before surgery. they may also be used if an operation is not possible.radiotherapyuses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. it can be used to treat any cancer cells that may be left behind after surgery, or to shrink a cancer.chemotherapyis the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. it is usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein. chemotherapy may be used to lower the risk of the cancer coming back or to treat cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.clinical trials are usually not available as the number of children with rare cancers is so small. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) aims to improve the care and treatment of children with cancer and it develops guidelines on the best ways of treating and managing those with rare tumours. doctors communicate with specialist colleagues in other countries to promote research in rare tumours and develop new forms of treatment.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",
       " 'Raynaud’s phenomenon': 'raynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body – usually the fingers and toes.it’s often referred to as raynaud’s syndrome, raynaud’s disease or just raynaud’s.raynaud’s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. the condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood.this causes the affected area to change colour to white, then blue and then red, as the bloodflow returns. you may also experience numbness, pain, and pins and needles.symptoms of raynaud’s can last from a few minutes to several hours.iit’s not a serious threat to your health, but can be painful and difficult to live with. if can affect your ability to move your fingers and hands. people with raynaud’s often go for long periods without any symptoms, and sometimes the condition goes away altogether.other parts of the body that can be affected by raynaud’s include the ears, nose, nipples and lips.in many cases, it may be possible to control the symptoms of raynaud’s yourself by avoiding the cold, wearing gloves and using relaxation techniques when feeling stressed.stopping smokingcan also improve symptoms, as smoking can affect your circulation.if you’re unable to control your symptoms yourself, then a medication called nifedipine may be recommended.read more abouttreating raynaud’s.there are two types of raynaud’s: primary – when the condition develops by itself (this is the most common type) secondary – when it’s caused by another health conditionmost cases of secondary raynaud’s are associated with conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue (autoimmune conditions), such as scleroderma andlupus.the causes of primary raynaud’s are unclear. however 1 in 10 people with primary raynaud’s goes on to develop a condition associated with secondary raynaud’s, such as lupus.your gp can help to determine whether you have primary or secondary raynaud’s by examining your symptoms and carrying outblood tests.read more aboutwhat causes raynaud’sanddiagnosing raynaud’s.secondary raynaud’s can severely restrict the blood supply, so it carries a higher risk of complications, such as ulcers, scarring and even tissue death (gangrene) in the most serious cases. however, severe complications are rare.read more about thecomplications of raynaud’s.raynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition. it affects up to 20% of the adult population worldwide. there may be as many as 10 million people with the condition in the uk.primary raynaud’s usually begins in your 20s or 30s. secondary raynaud’s can develop at any age, depending on the cause.raynaud’s is slightly more common in women than men.raynaud’s phenomenon is the result of over-sensitive blood vessels in the body’s extremities. in many cases, no cause is identified, although it’s sometimes linked to other health conditions.when your body is exposed to cold temperatures, the extremities, such as your fingers and toes, lose heat. this is because the small blood vessels under the skin spasm, slowing down the blood supply that is helping to preserve your body’s core temperature.in people with raynaud’s, the sensitive blood vessels overreact to cold temperatures and become narrower than usual, significantly restricting the blood flow.symptoms can be triggered by mildly cool weather, getting something out of the freezer, or running your hands under a cold tap. strong emotions such asstress or anxietymay also trigger symptoms.the most common form of raynaud’s is primary raynaud’s phenomenon. this means the condition occurs by itself, without being associated with another health condition.it seems that primary raynaud’s is caused by disruptions in how the nervous system controls blood vessels. exactly what causes these disruptions is unclear.there’s some evidence that primary raynaud’s may be an inherited condition, as cases have been known to run in families.in some cases, an underlying health condition could be causing the blood vessels to overreact. this is called secondary raynaud’s.the majority of cases of secondary raynaud’s are associated with autoimmune conditions, which cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue.autoimmune conditions known to be associated with secondary raynaud’s include: scleroderma – a condition that causes hardening and thickening of the skin rheumatoid arthritis– which causes joint pain and swelling sjogren’s syndrome– where the immune system attacks the body’s sweat and tear glands lupus– which causes tiredness, joint pain and skin rashesaround 1 in 10 people with primary raynaud’s go on to develop an autoimmune condition.blood-born viral infections,hepatitis bandhepatitis c, can occasionally trigger raynaud’s in some people.some types of cancer can cause secondary raynaud’s. these are usually cancers that develop inside the blood, bone marrow or immune system, such as: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia– a cancer of the white blood cells that mainly affects children lymphoma – a cancer that develops inside one or more of the glands that are part of the immune system multiple myeloma– a cancer that develops inside bone marrowsecondary raynaud’s can also be a side effect of taking certain medicines, including: some types of anti-migrainemedication – such as sumatriptan and ergotamine beta-blockers– which are used to treathigh blood pressureandheart disease somechemotherapymedicines decongestants thecontraceptive pill medicines used inhormone replacement therapy some types of medicines used to treat high blood pressureillegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can also cause secondary raynaud’s.raynaud’s sometimes results from a physical injury. it can also affect musicians, people who type a lot, or other people who use their fingers and hands more than usual.skin and tissue damage caused by frostbite can also lead to raynaud’s.smoking cigarettes also increases your risk of developing raynaud’s. read about thesupport available to help you quit smoking.vibration white finger is a term used when secondary raynaud’s has been caused by vibration. this typically happens to people who regularly use certain types of vibrating tools, such as: sanders, grinders and disc cutters hammer drills chainsaws, hedge trimmers and power mowersany vibrating tool that causes tingling or numbness in your fingers could lead to vibration white finger.your employer has a responsibility to protect you from vibration white finger. if the job can’t be done without vibrating tools: ask to use suitable low-vibration tools make sure you’re using the right tool for the job check tools are properly maintained keep cutting tools sharp reduce the amount of time you use the tool in one go by doing other jobs in between keep warm at work wear anti-vibration gloves store tools indoors, so they don’t have cold handles when next used encourage your blood circulation by keeping warm, stopping smoking and massaging and exercising your fingers during your breaksif you’re diagnosed with the condition, tell your employer as soon as possible. if you stop using vibrating tools at an early stage, you may recover fully.by law, your employer must contact thehealth and safety executiveabout your condition. you may be entitled to an industrial injuries disablement benefit, which is a payment given to people who have become ill or injured as a result of their work.see the gov.uk website for more information about theindustrial injuries disablement benefit.raynaud’s phenomenon can usually be diagnosed after an examination of your symptoms and some blood tests.your gp may place your hands in cold water or cool air to see if you show symptoms of raynaud’s.further testing is usually recommended to find out whether you have primary or secondary raynaud’s.secondary raynaud’s may require more treatment and, in some cases, referral to a specialist.secondary raynaud’s may be suspected if: your symptoms only started when you were over 30 years of age – most cases of primary raynaud’s begin between the ages of 20 to 30 you’re experiencing severe pain during an attack of raynaud’s only one side of your body is affectedyour gp may also check the tiny blood vessels, known as capillaries, found where your nail meets the finger. these capillaries are often larger in people with secondary raynaud’s, and look like red pen marks.your gp may also refer you forblood teststo check for other health conditions that could be causing your symptoms. these tests may include: a full blood count – to check for infection or, much less commonly, a cancer of the blood, such as leukaemia an antinuclear antibodies (ana) test – to check for an overactive immune system, which is common in people with autoimmune conditions such as scleroderma andlupus erythrocyte sedimentation rate – to check for an autoimmune disorderif you’ve been diagnosed with raynaud’s,scleroderma & raynaud’s uk (sruk)may be helpful.it is the uk’s leading charity for people affected by the condition.you can usually treat raynaud’s phenomenon yourself, although medication is sometimes necessary.if you’ve been diagnosed with secondary raynaud’s, you may be referred to a specialist in the treatment of the underlying condition.if your secondary raynaud’s may be a side effect of a medication, you may be asked to stop taking it, to see if your symptoms improve.the following advice is recommended for both primary and secondary raynaud’s. keep your whole body warm, especially your hands and feet. wear gloves and warm footwear in cold weather. if you smoke, stop. quitting smoking will improve your circulation, which should help to improve symptoms. exercise regularly, as this helps to improve your circulation and reduce stress levels (see below). for most people, 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week is recommended. read more aboutexercise. try to minimise your stress levels. regular exercise,eating a healthy diet, andrelaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or activities such asyoga, can help. you may find it useful to avoid stimulants such as coffee, tea and cola.if you find it difficult to control feelings of stress, you may require additional treatment, such as counselling. read more abouttherapies for stress.if your symptoms fail to improve, you may be prescribed nifedipine. this is the only medicine licensed to treat raynaud’s phenomenon in the uk. it doesn’t cure raynaud’s, but can help to relieve the symptoms.nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker – a type of medication that encourages the blood vessels to widen.depending on the pattern of your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment, you may be asked to take your medication every day. alternatively, you may only need to take it as prevention; for example, during a sudden snap of cold weather.side effects are common and include: oedema – swelling of certain parts of the body, such as your hands and feet, due to a build-up of fluid headaches heart palpitations dizziness constipationdon’t drink grapefruit juice when taking nifedipine, as this could make side effects worse.the side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine, but tell your gp if you find them particularly troublesome. there are alternative calcium channel blockers that may suit you better.other medications have been used to treat raynaud’s, but their use is controversial, as there is limited evidence to show they’re effective in most people. however, some people have claimed to benefit from treatment. these medications include: fluoxetine – which was widely used in the treatment of depression sildenafil – which is used to treat erectile dysfunction (inability to get or maintain an erection)these medicines are not licensed for the treatment of raynaud’s in the uk, but you may be prescribed them if it’s thought the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks.surgery for raynaud’s is rare. it’s usually only recommended if your symptoms are so severe that there’s a risk the affected body part, such as your fingers, could lose their blood supply and begin to die. read more about thecomplications of raynaud’s phenomenon.a type of surgery called sympathectomy is sometimes used. it involves cutting the nerves causing the affected blood vessels to spasm.the results of a sympathectomy are often only temporary and further treatment and possibly more surgery may be required after a few years.people with raynaud’s phenomenon have an increased risk of developing other problems, such as scleroderma.around 1 in 16 women and 1 in 50 men with raynaud’s develop a condition called scleroderma, usually between the ages of 25 and 55.scleroderma is when the body produces excessively high levels of collagen.scleroderma is a greek word meaning hard skin, but it can affect other areas of the body, such as the kidneys, heart and lungs.symptoms of scleroderma include: puffy and itchy skin tight and uncomfortable joints small calcium spots and red spots under the skin trouble swallowing, known asdysphagia diarrhoea, bloating orconstipationthere’s no cure for scleroderma, but there are ways of overcoming problems it may cause.for example, medicines can reverse or slow down the processes that cause damage around the body.for more information, visitscleroderma & raynaud’s uk (sruk), a uk charity dedicated to improving the lives of people affected by scleroderma and raynaud’s.in severe cases of raynaud’s, the blood supply to an affected body part can become severely diminished. without a constant supply of blood, the tissue in the body part will begin to die. this problem is rare and normally only occurs in secondary raynaud’s.the initial sign is an open sore, known as an ulcer, which develops on the surface of the body part. if you suspect a skin ulcer, contact your gp for advice.left untreated, the tissue can die, which is known as gangrene (specifically, dry gangrene).the symptoms of dry gangrene normally begin with a red line on the skin that marks the edges of the affected tissue. the tissue becomes cold and numb, and can be painful as the tissue dies. however, many people, particularly the elderly, experience no sensations.the affected area changes colour from red, to brown, to black. the dead tissue will then shrivel up, separate from the healthy tissue and fall off.these complications normally require admission to hospital, where you’ll be given medication designed to thin your blood, which should help to restore blood flow.if you fail to respond to treatment, you may need surgery to unblock or repair damaged blood vessels.',\n",
       " 'Reactive arthritis': 'reactive arthritis, formerly known as reiter’s syndrome, is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) in various places in the body.it usually develops following an infection, and in most cases clears up in a few months without causing long-term problems.the three most common places affected by reactive arthritis are: the joints (arthritis), which can cause pain, stiffness and swelling the eyes (conjunctivitis), which can cause eye pain and redness the urethra (non-gonococcal urethritis), which can cause pain when urinating (the urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body)however, most people will not experience all of these problems.read more about thesymptoms of reactive arthritis.reactive arthritis usually develops within four weeks of an infection, typically after a sexually transmitted infection (sti) such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel.for reasons that are still unclear, the immune system (the body’s defence against infection) appears to malfunction in response to the infection and starts attacking healthy tissue, causing it to become inflamed.read more about thecauses of reactive arthritis.see your gp if you have swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had symptoms of an infection such asdiarrhoeaor pain when passing urine.there is no single test for reactive arthritis, although blood and urine tests, genital swabs andx-raysmay be used to check for infection and rule out other causes of your symptoms.your gp will also want to know about your recent medical history, such as whether you may have recently had a bowel infection or an sti.there is currently no cure for reactive arthritis, but most people get better in around six months. meanwhile, treatment can help to relieve symptoms such as pain and stiffness.symptoms can often be controlled usingnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)and painkillers such asibuprofen.severe symptoms may require more powerful steroid medication (corticosteroids) or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards).read more abouttreating reactive arthritis.reactive arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects young adults aged 20-40.men are generally affected more than woman – particularly in cases linked to stis, which are estimated to be about 10 times more common in men.people who have a certain gene called hla-b27, which is found in around one in every 10 people in the uk, are about thought to be around 50 times more likely to develop reactive arthritis than those who don’t have this gene.the most effective way to reduce your risk of reactive arthritis is to avoid the stis and bowel infections that most commonly cause the condition.the most effective way of preventing stis is to always use a barrier method ofcontraception, such as acondom, during sex with a new partner.read advice oncontraceptionandsexual health.the symptoms of reactive arthritis usually develop within four weeks of an infection.in most cases, reactive arthritis follows a sexually transmitted infection (sti) such as chlamydia, or a bowel infection such asfood poisoning.the three parts of the body most commonly affected by reactive arthritis are the: joints and tendons urinary system eyeshowever, most people won’t experience problems in all of these areas.reactive arthritis usually involves inflammation of the joints (arthritis) and tendons, which can cause: joint pain, tenderness and swelling – usually in weight-bearing joints such as your knees, feet and ankles lower back and buttock pain swelling of your fingers and toes joint stiffness – particularly in the morningsee your gp if you have any swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently haddiarrhoeaor problems passing urine.reactive arthritis can sometimes also involve inflammation of the urethra (non-gonococcal urethritis), which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. symptoms of urethritis can include: pain or a burning sensation when you pee urinating more often than usual having a sudden urge to pee a discharge of fluid from the penis or vagina blood in your urine (less commonly)reactive arthritis may occasionally involve inflammation of the eyes (conjunctivitis). symptoms of conjunctivitis can include: red eyes watery eyes eye pain swollen eye lidsin rare cases, a type of uveitis called iritis can develop. iritis can cause the eyes to become painful, red and sensitive to light. see your doctor or an eye specialist as soon as possible if you have these symptoms.reactive arthritis can also cause symptoms, including: feeling unusually tired a high temperature (fever) weight loss mouth ulcers painless white patches inside your mouth a rash thick and crumbly nails abdominal (tummy) pain bouts of diarrhoeait’s not known exactly what causes reactive arthritis, but it’s thought to be the result of the immune system reacting to an infection.your immune system is your body’s defence against illness and infection. when it senses a virus or bacteria, it sends antibodies and cells to fight the infection. this causes tissues to swell, known as inflammation, which makes it harder for the infection to spread.in cases of reactive arthritis, something goes wrong with the immune system and it causes inflammation in parts of the body that were not infected, often after the infection has already passed.the two most common types of infection linked to reactive arthritis are: sexually transmitted infections (stis) – such aschlamydiaorgonorrhoea, although many cases occur after non-gonococcal urethritis infections of the bowel and digestive system (gastrointestinal infections) – usually caused by either campylobacter or salmonella bacteria, both of which can causefood poisoningresearch has shown that people with a specific gene known as hla-b27 have a significantly increased chance of developing reactive arthritis, as well as related conditions such asankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis that affects the spine).in the uk, it’s estimated that around 1 in every 10 people have the hla-b27 gene. around 3 out of every 4 cases of reactive arthritis develop in people with the gene.people with the hla-b27 gene also tend to have more severe and longer-lasting symptoms, with a greater risk of their symptoms recurring.exactly how the gene contributes to the development of reactive arthritis is unclear.there’s no cure for reactive arthritis, but the condition is usually temporary and treatment can help to relieve your symptoms.most people will make a full recovery in about six months, although around one in five cases lasts a year or more, and a small number of people experience long-term joint problems.there is also a risk you could develop the condition again after another infection.in the initial stages of reactive arthritis, it’s recommended that you get plenty of rest and avoid using affected joints.as your symptoms improve, you should begin a gradual programme of exercise designed to strengthen affected muscles and improve the range of movement in your affected joints.your gp or specialist may recommend a suitableexercise programme for your arthritis. alternatively, you may be referred to a physiotherapist for physical therapy.you might also find ice packs and heat pads useful in reducing joint pain and swelling, although these should not be directly placed on your skin.antibioticsmay not help to treat reactive arthritis itself, but they are sometimes prescribed if you have an ongoing infection – particularly if you have a sexually transmitted infection (sti). your recent sexual partner(s) may also need treatment.non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such asibuprofen, are the main medication used for reactive arthritis, as they can help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain.however, taking a regular dose of a nsaid on a long-term basis can increase your risk of problems such asstomach ulcers. if you are at an increased risk of developing stomach ulcers, your gp may recommend an additional medication known as a proton pump inhibitor (ppi), which can protect your stomach by reducing the production of stomach acid.rarely, long-term use of nsaids can also slightly increase your risk of having aheart attackorstroke. read more about theside effects of nsaids.steroid medication (corticosteroids) may be recommended if your symptoms don’t respond to nsaids, or you’re unable to use nsaids.steroids work by blocking the effects of many of the chemicals the body uses to trigger inflammation.a corticosteroid called prednisolone is usually the preferred choice. prednisolone can be given as an injection into a joint or as a tablet. eye drops are also available if you have inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis).around 1 in 20 people who take prednisolone will experience changes in their mental state, such asdepressionor hallucinations. contact your gp as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behaviour.other side effects can include weight gain,acne, stomach ulcers andosteoporosis, although these should improve as your dose is decreased. read more about theside effects of corticosteroids.if your symptoms persist despite treatment with nsaids and/or corticosteroids, you may be prescribed a medication known as a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (dmard).like corticosteroids, dmards work by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals your immune system uses to trigger inflammation.it can take a few months before you notice a dmard working, so it’s important to keep taking medication even if you don’t see immediate results.a dmard called sulfasalazine is usually the preferred option. common side effects of sulfasalazine include feeling sick, loss of appetite andheadaches, although these usually improve once your body gets used to the medication.dmards may also cause changes in your blood or liver, so it’s important to have regularblood testswhile taking these medicines. arthritis the pain toolkit pain concern versus arthritis: reactive arthritis',\n",
       " 'Restless legs syndrome': \"restless legs syndrome, also known as willis-ekbom disease, is a common condition of the nervous system that causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs.it can also cause an unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation in the feet, calves and thighs. the sensation is often worse in the evening or at night. occasionally, the arms are affected too.restless legs syndrome is also associated with involuntary jerking of the legs and arms, known as periodic limb movements in sleep (plms).some people have the symptoms of restless legs syndrome occasionally, while others have them every day. the symptoms can vary from mild to severe. in severe cases, restless legs syndrome can be very distressing and disrupt a person’s daily activities.in the majority of cases, there’s no obvious cause of restless legs syndrome. this known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families.some neurologists (specialists in treating conditions that affect the nervous system) believe the symptoms of restless legs syndrome may have something to do with how the body handles a chemical called dopamine. dopamine is involved in controlling muscle movement and may be responsible for the involuntary leg movements associated with restless legs syndrome.in some cases, restless legs syndrome is caused by an underlying health condition, such asiron deficiency anaemiaor kidney failure. this is known as secondary restless legs syndrome.there’s also a link between restless legs syndrome and pregnancy. about 1 in 5 pregnant women will experience symptoms in the last three months of their pregnancy, although it’s not clear exactly why this is. in such cases, restless legs syndrome usually disappears after the woman has given birth.read more about thecauses of restless legs syndromemild cases of restless legs syndrome that aren’t linked to an underlying health condition may not require any treatment, other than making a few lifestyle changes, such as: adopting good sleep habits – for example, following a regular bedtime ritual, sleeping regular hours, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night quitting smokingif you smoke exercising regularlyduring the daytimeif your symptoms are more severe, you may need medication to regulate the levels of dopamine and iron in your body.if restless legs syndrome is caused by iron deficiency anaemia, iron supplements may be all that’s needed to treat the symptoms.read more abouttreating restless legs syndromeas many as 1 in 10 people are affected by restless legs syndrome at some point in their life.women are twice as likely to develop restless legs syndrome than men. it’s also more common in middle age, although the symptoms can develop at any age, including childhood.the symptoms of restless legs syndrome will usually disappear if it’s possible to address an underlying cause.however, if the cause is unknown, the symptoms can sometimes get worse with time and severely affect the person’s life. restless legs syndrome isn’t life threatening, but severe cases can severely disrupt sleep (causinginsomnia) and trigger anxiety anddepression.restless legs syndrome typically causes an overwhelming urge to move your legs and an uncomfortable sensation in your legs.the sensation may also affect your arms, chest and face, too. it has been described as: tingling, burning, itching or throbbing a “creepy-crawly” feeling feeling like fizzy water is inside the blood vessels in the legs a painful, cramping sensation in the legs, particularly in the calvesthese unpleasant sensations can range from mild to unbearable, and are usually worse in the evening and during the night. they can often be relieved by moving or rubbing your legs.some people experience symptoms occasionally, while others have them every day. you may find it difficult to sit for long periods of time – for example, on a long train journey.just over half of people with restless legs syndrome also experience episodes of lowerback pain.up to 80% of people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movements in sleep (plms).if you have plms, your leg will jerk or twitch uncontrollably, usually at night while you’re asleep. the movements are brief and repetitive, and usually occur every 10 to 60 seconds.plms can be severe enough to wake up both you and your partner. the involuntary leg movements can also occur when you’re awake and resting.in many cases, the exact cause of restless legs syndrome is unknown.when no cause can be found, it’s known as “idiopathic” or primary restless legs syndrome.research has identified specific genes related to restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families. in these cases, symptoms usually occur before the age of 40.there’s evidence to suggest restless legs syndrome is related to a problem with part of the brain called the basal ganglia. the basal ganglia uses a chemical (neurotransmitter) called dopamine to help control muscle activity and movement.dopamine acts as a messenger between the brain and nervous system to help the brain regulate and co-ordinate movement. if nerve cells become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced, which causes muscle spasms and involuntary movements.dopamine levels naturally fall towards the end of the day, which may explain why thesymptoms of restless legs syndromeare often worse in the evening and during the night.restless legs syndrome can sometimes occur as a complication of another health condition, or it can be the result of another health-related factor. this is known as secondary restless legs syndrome.you can develop secondary restless legs syndrome if you: haveiron deficiency anaemia– low levels of iron in

that don’t cause restless legs syndrome, but can make symptoms worse. these include medications such as: someantidepressants antipsychotics lithium – used in the treatment ofbipolar disorder calcium channel blockers – used in the treatment ofhigh blood pressure some antihistamines metoclopramide – used to relieve nauseaother possible triggers include: excessivesmoking, caffeine oralcohol being overweight orobese stress lack ofexercisethere’s no single test for diagnosing restless legs syndrome.a diagnosis will be based on your symptoms, your medical and family history, a physical examination, and your test results.your gp should be able to diagnose restless legs syndrome, but they may refer you to a neurologist if there’s any uncertainty.there are four main criteria your gp or specialist will look for to confirm a diagnosis. these are: an overwhelming urge to move your legs, usually with an uncomfortable sensation such as itching or tingling your symptoms occur or get worse when you’re resting or inactive your symptoms are relieved by moving your legs or rubbing them your symptoms are worse during the evening or at nightyour gp or specialist will ask you about the pattern of your symptoms to help assess their severity. for example, they may ask you: how often you have symptoms how unpleasant you find your symptoms whether your symptoms cause significant distress whether your sleep is disrupted, making you tired during the daykeeping a sleep diary may help your doctor assess your symptoms. you can use the diary to record your daily sleeping habits, such as the time you go to bed, how long it takes you to fall asleep, how often you wake during the night, and episodes of tiredness during the day.mildsymptoms of restless legs syndromecan usually be treated by making lifestyle changes – for example, establishing a regular sleeping pattern and avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine, alcohol or tobacco, in the evening.if your symptoms are more severe, you may need medication to bring them under control.read more abouttreating restless leg syndromeyour gp may refer you forblood teststo confirm or rule out possible underlying causes of restless legs syndrome. for example, you may have blood tests to rule out conditions such asanaemia,diabetesand kidney function problems.it’s particularly important to find out the levels of iron in your blood because low iron levels can sometimes cause secondary restless legs syndrome. low iron levels can be treated with iron tablets.if you have restless legs syndrome and your sleep is being severely disrupted, sleep tests – such as a suggested immobilisation test – may be recommended. the test involves lying on a bed for a set period of time without moving your legs while any involuntary leg movements are monitored.occasionally, polysomnography may be recommended. this is a test that measures your breathing rate, brain waves and heartbeat throughout the course of a night. the results will confirm whether you have periodic limb movements in sleep (plms).mild restless legs syndrome that isn’t linked to an underlying health condition can be managed with just a few lifestyle changes.if symptoms are more severe, medication may be needed.restless legs syndrome caused by an underlying health condition can often be cured by treating that condition. for example,iron deficiency

appointment to see your gpduring an episode of restless legs syndrome, the following measures may help relieve your symptoms: massaging your legs taking a hot bath in the evening applying a hot or cold compress to your leg muscles doing activities that distract your mind, such as reading or watching television relaxation exercises, such asyoga or tai chi walkingandstretchinga small medical trial carried out in 2011 found a type of osteopathic exercise technique called positional release manipulation could be of benefit to people with restless legs syndrome. it involves holding different parts of the body in positions found to reduce feelings of pain and discomfort.dopamine agonists may be recommended if you’re experiencing frequent symptoms of restless legs syndrome. they work by increasing dopamine levels, which are often low.dopamine agonists that may be recommended include: ropinirole pramipexole rotigotine skin patchthese medications can occasionally make you feel sleepy, so you should be cautious when driving or using tools or machinery after taking them. other possible side effects can include nausea, dizziness andheadaches.if you experience nausea while taking a dopamine agonist, you may be given medication to help with this (antiemitic medication).impulse control disorder (icd) is a less common side effect sometimes associated with dopamine agonists.people with icd are unable to resist the urge to do something harmful to themselves or others. for example, this could be an addiciton toalcohol, drugs, gambling, shopping, or sex (hypersexuality).however, the urges associated with icd will subside once treatment with the dopamine agonist is stopped.a mild opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol, may be prescribed to relieve pain associated with restless legs syndrome.gabapentin and pregabalin are also sometimes prescribed to help relieve painful symptoms of restless legs syndrome. side effects of these medications include dizziness, tiredness and headaches.if restless legs syndrome is disrupting your sleep, a short-term course of medication may be recommended to help you sleep.these types of medication are known as hypnotics, and include temazepam and loprazolam. hypnotics are usually only recommended for short-term use (typically no longer than a week).you may find you still feel sleepy or “hungover” the morning after taking your medication.levodopa may be recommended if you only have occasional symptoms of restless legs syndrome. this is because if you took levodopa every day, there’s a high risk it would actually make your symptoms worse.levodopa is available in tablet or liquid form, and you should take it once you feel the symptoms of restless legs syndrome coming on.the medication will make you feel very sleepy (often suddenly), so you should never drive or use tools or machinery after taking levodopa. iron deficiency anaemia parkinson's disease insomnia nice: restless legs syndrome\",\n",
       " 'Retinoblastoma: Children': 'retinoblastoma is an uncommon eye cancer that usually affects children under 5, although it can affect children of any age. treatment is very effective and nearly all children with retinoblastoma are cured.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.retinoblastoma develops in the light-sensitive lining of the eye (called the retina).there are 2 forms of retinoblastoma:the heritable form of retinoblastoma, which accounts for about 2 in every 5 cases, is caused by a genetic abnormality. this means that an abnormal gene allows the tumour to develop. this abnormal gene may either be inherited from a parent or happen for the first time at an early stage of development in the womb.genetic counselling and support is available for families in which a member has retinoblastoma. not all children of a parent with retinoblastoma will inherit this gene, but children born into families with a history of retinoblastoma are offered blood testing. they are also usually checked (screened) soon after birth for signs of retinoblastoma. this means that treatment can be started early if a tumour does develop.screening usually starts shortly after birth and is repeated every few months for 5 years. an eye specialist examines the eye, while shining a light into it with an ophthalmoscope. in younger children, this may need to be done under ageneral anaesthetic.the genetic abnormality in the heritable form of retinoblastoma is now well-understood. but we don’t know what causes non-heritable retinoblastoma.some children with a family history of retinoblastoma are picked up by screening before they have any symptoms.if there’s no family history of retinoblastoma, the first sign of the condition is often a white pupil that does not reflect light (leukocoria). this may be picked up when a picture of your child is taken using flash photography. the pupil of the affected eye may look white in the photograph.some children may have a squint or, if the tumour is large, they may have a painful red eye.tests are likely to involve an examination under anaesthetic (eua) where an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) examines your child’s eye while they’re asleep. unlike nearly all other types of cancer, retinoblastomas can be diagnosed just by their appearance. so it’s not usually necessary to take a sample of tissue (abiopsy). your child will have several more euas to check how treatment is progressing.when retinoblastoma is diagnosed, your child may have some other tests to check the exact position and size of the tumour, and whether it has begun to spread into surrounding structures. this is known as staging.they may have some of the following tests: anultrasound scan– this is a painless scan that uses sound waves to examine the eye and the surrounding area anmri (magnetic resonance imaging) scan– this uses magnetism to build up a detailed picture of the eye and the head a lumbar puncture – the doctor inserts a fine needle between the bones in the lower spine to remove a sample of the fluid from around the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) then the fluid is examined under a microscope to check whether there are any cancer cells present a bone marrow sample – this may be taken to check whether there are any cancer cells in the bone marrow (where our blood cells are made); the doctor inserts a needle into the hip bone and draws some of the bone marrow out with a syringe so that it can be checked for any cancer cells a bone scan – this involves taking a series ofx-raysto check for signs of any spread to the bones a blood test – this may be taken for genetic testing for the rb gene; the results of this test can take some monthsthe doctor or a specialist nurse will explain more about the tests that your child needs.the stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread from where it first started. knowing the stage of your child’s retinoblastoma helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.the following staging system is commonly used for retinoblastoma.there is cancer in 1 or both eyes, but it has not spread to other parts of the eye or the tissues surrounding the eye. this stage may be sub-divided into 5 grades (a–e), depending on the size and position of the cancer and on whether there’s any damage to the eye.the cancer has spread outside the eye into surrounding tissue, or to other parts of the body.treatment depends on the number, position and size of the tumours in the eye. the aim of treatment is to first get rid of the cancer, and secondly to try to keep the sight in the eye. some treatments may cause changes to the vision in the affected eye. your child’s specialist will talk to you about the possible risks as well as the advantages of the treatment.for smaller tumours, treatment is given to the eye itself (called local therapy), while your child is asleep and under anaesthetic.this is used to freeze the tumours. more than 1 session may be necessary, in which case they are usually done at monthly intervals.a laser is used to heat the tumour. your child may need a number of sessions at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks.a small radioactive disc is stitched over the tumour on the outside of the eye. the disc needs to stay in place for up to 4 days while the radiation destroys the cancer cells. this is done for slightly larger tumours, or tumours that have not been successfully treated with other methods.this process uses heat to destroy the cancer cells and may be combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as heat can improve the effectiveness of these treatments. the heat is produced by a laser, which is directed at the tumour.this is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. it may be given before the local treatments mentioned above, to help shrink the tumour and make treatment more successful.chemotherapycan also be used if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if there’s a risk that it may spread. the chemotherapy drugs most commonly used to treat retinoblastoma are carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine.newer techniques include giving chemotherapy directly into the artery (the blood vessel) that supplies the eye (intra-arterial chemotherapy) or injecting chemotherapy into the central gelatinous part of the eye (intra-vitreal chemotherapy).if the tumour is very large and the vision in the eye is lost, your child is likely to need an operation to remove the eye. the specialist will only do this if it is absolutely necessary. an artificial eye is then fitted.radiotherapytreats cancer by using high energy rays from a machine to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. it can be given to the whole eye but does have some effect on the surrounding tissue. radiotherapy for retinoblastoma is normally only used when other treatments have not worked well.the side effects will depend on the treatment your child is having. the immediate side effects will usually improve when treatment finishes. but unfortunately, some treatments may cause side effects that develop many years later. the specialist will explain all of this to you before treatment starts. your child’s follow-up will include checking for any long-term effects of treatment.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancers.if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. written information is provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.at least 9 out of every 10 children with retinoblastoma are cured. following treatment, the eye specialist will frequently examine your child’s eye under anaesthetic to check that the retina is healthy, the cancer has not come back, and no new tumours have developed. follow-up is usually in a clinic for childhood cancers, called a paediatric oncology clinic.children with heritable retinoblastoma will be given genetic counselling when they are old enough to understand it.having the heritable form of retinoblastoma means an increased risk of developing other types of cancer later in life. your child will be followed up closely into adulthood. they will be encouraged to get any new symptoms, such as a lump, checked early, and to have a healthy lifestyle to help to reduce cancer risk.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",

important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.sarcomas are rare types of tumour that develop in the supporting tissues of the body, such as bone, muscle or cartilage. there are 2 main types of sarcomas:rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common of soft tissue sarcomas in children. these tumours develop from muscle or fibrous tissue and can grow in any part of the body.the most common areas of the body to be affected are around the head and neck, bladder, testes, womb, or vagina.sometimes tumours are also found in a muscle or a limb, in the chest or in the abdominal wall. if the tumour is in the head or neck area, it can occasionally spread into the brain or the fluid around the spinal cord.the causes of rhabdomyosarcoma are unknown but research is going on all the time. children with certain rare genetic disorders, such as li-fraumeni syndrome, have a higher risk of developing rhabdomyosarcoma.the most common symptom is a lump or swelling. other symptoms will depend on the part of the body that’s affected by the rhabdomyosarcoma: a tumour in the head or neck area can sometimes cause a blockage (obstruction) and discharge from the nose or throat; occasionally, an eye may appear swollen and protruding a tumour in the abdomen (tummy) can cause pain or discomfort in the abdomen and difficulty going to the toilet (constipation) a tumour in the bladder may cause symptoms such as blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine (peeing)different tests are usually needed to diagnose a rhabdomyosarcoma. your child may need a small operation to remove a sample from the tumour (abiopsy) so that it can be examined under a microscope. this is usually done under a general anaesthetic.tests may be done to check the exact size of the tumour and to find out if it has spread to any other part of the body. these may include: a chestx-rayto check the lungs anultrasound ctormri scans blood testsand bone marrowany tests and

(localised disease), or if it has spread to another part of the body (metastatic disease).there are different ways of staging rhabdomyosarcoma, and your child’s specialist doctor will explain more about the system they are using.rhabdomyosarcomas are rare tumours and should be treated at specialist centres. treatment will depend on the size of the tumour, its position in the body and whether it has spread.the 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. your child may have a combination of treatments.chemotherapyis the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. it can be given: to shrink the tumour before surgery after surgery to reduce the risk of rhabdomyosarcoma coming backthe drugs used and the length of treatment depends on the type and stage of the rhabdomyosarcoma.if it is possible, your child will have an operation to remove all or as much as possible of the tumour, without damaging surrounding tissue or organs. the operation will depend on the size of the tumour and where it is in your body. the surgeon will explain what is involved. chemotherapy is usually given before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with surgery. if an operation isn’t possible, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are given.radiotherapytreats cancer by using high energy rays, which destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. it may be given after surgery to the area where the rhabdomyosarcoma started.the side effects will depend on the treatment being given and the part of the body that is being treated. your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.chemotherapy may cause side effects such as feeling sick,hair loss,tiredness, and an increased risk of infection. but it can also make your child feel better by relieving any symptoms the tumour is causing.radiotherapy can make your child feel tired, and the skin in the area that’s being treated may go red or get darker. other side effects will depend on the area of the body that is being treated. your child’s specialist doctor or nurse will explain this.a small number of children may develop long-term side effects many years after treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma. this depends on the type of treatment your child had. your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible risk of late side effects. follow-up for children who’ve had cancer includes close monitoring for any signs of any late effects.late effects may include a possible reduction in bone growth, infertility, a change in the way the heart and the kidneys work, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancer. if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. written information is provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.before any trial is allowed to take place, it must be approved by an ethics committee, which protects the interests of the patients taking part. if you decide to take part in a trial, your doctor or a research nurse must discuss the treatment with you so that you understand the trial and what it means for your child to take part. you may decide not to take part, or you can withdraw from a trial at any stage. you will then receive the best standard treatment available.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.after treatment, the doctors will regularly check your child to be sure that the cancer has not come back and there are no complications. after a while, you will not need to visit the clinic so often.if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows their situation in detail.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",
       " 'Rheumatoid arthritis': 'rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints.the hands, feet and wrists are commonly affected, but it can also cause problems in other parts of the body.there may be periods where your symptoms become worse, known as a flare-up or flare. a flare can be difficult to predict, but with treatment it is possible to decrease the number of flares and minimise or prevent long-term damage to the joints.read more about thesymptoms of rheumatoid arthritisandliving with rheumatoid arthritis.you should see your gp if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, so your gp can try to identify the underlying cause.diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis quickly is important because early treatment can help stop the condition getting worse and reduce the risk of further problems such as joint damage.read more aboutdiagnosing rheumatoid arthritis.rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. this means that your immune system – which usually fights infection – attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making them swollen, stiff and painful.over time, this can damage the joint itself, the cartilage and nearby bone.it’s not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, although you are at an increased risk if you are a woman, you have a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, or you smoke.read more about thecauses of rheumatoid arthritis.rheumatoid arthritis affects around 400,000 people in the uk.it can affect adults at any age, but most commonly starts between the ages of 40 and 50. about three times as many women as men are affected.there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, but early diagnosis and appropriate treatment enables many people with rheumatoid arthritis to have periods of months or even years between flares and to be able to lead full lives and continue regular employment.the main treatment options include: medication that is taken in the long-term to relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the condition supportive treatments, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, to help keep you mobile and find ways around any problems you have with daily activities surgery to correct any joint problems that developread more abouttreating rheumatoid arthritis.having rheumatoid arthritis can lead to several other conditions that may cause additional symptoms and can sometimes be life-threatening.possible complications include carpal tunnel syndrome, inflammation of other areas of the body (such as the lungs, heart and eyes), and an increased risk ofheart attacksandstrokes.ensuring that rheumatoid arthritis is well controlled helps reduce your risk of complications such as these.read more about thecomplications of rheumatoid arthritis.rheumatoid arthritis mainly affects the joints, although it can cause problems in other parts of the body too.the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis often develop gradually over several weeks, but some cases can progress quickly over a number of days.the symptoms vary from person to person. they can come and go, and may change over time. you may occasionally experience flares when your condition deteriorates and your symptoms become more severe.rheumatoid arthritis is primarily a condition that affects the joints. it can cause problems in any joint in the body, although the small joints in the hands and feet are often the first to be affected.rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the joints symmetrically (both sides of the body at the same time and to the same extent), but this is not always the case.the main symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the joints are outlined below.the joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis is usually a throbbing and aching pain. it is often worse in the mornings and after a period of inactivity.joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis can feel stiff. for example, if your hands are affected, you may not be able to fully bend your fingers or form a fist.like joint pain, the stiffness is often more severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity. morning stiffness associated with another type of arthritis calledosteoarthritisusually wears off within 30 minutes of getting up, but rheumatoid arthritis morning stiffness often lasts longer than this.the lining of joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis become inflamed, which can cause the joints to swell, and become hot and tender to touch.in some people, firm swellings called rheumatoid nodules can also develop under the skin around affected joints.as well as problems affecting the joints, some people with rheumatoid arthritis experience a range of more general symptoms, such as: tiredness and a lack of energy a high temperature (fever) sweating a poor appetite weight lossthe inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis can also sometimes cause problems affecting other areas of the body, including dry eyes if the eyes are affected and chest pain if the heart or lungs are affected. read more about thecomplications of rheumatoid arthritis.you should see your gp if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.there are a number of conditions that can cause problems such as joint pain and stiffness, so it’s important to get a proper diagnosis.diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis as soon as possible is particularly important because early treatment can help stop the condition getting worse and reduce the risk of further problems such as joint damage.read more aboutdiagnosing rheumatoid arthritis.rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by the body’s immune system attacking itself. however, it is not yet known what triggers this.normally, your immune system makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses, helping fight infection. but if you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of your joints, where they attack the tissue surrounding the joint.this causes the thin layer of cells (synovium) covering your joints to become sore and inflamed.this inflammation in turn causes chemicals to be released that thicken the synovium and damage nearby: bones cartilage – the stretchy connective tissue between bones tendons – the tissue that connects bone to muscle ligaments – the tissue that connects bone and cartilageif the condition is not treated, these chemicals gradually cause the joint to lose its shape and alignment and, eventually, can destroy the joint completely.various theories of why the immune system starts to attack the joints have been suggested, including that an infection or virus may trigger this, but none of these theories has been proven.there are a number of things that may increase your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, including: your genes – there is some evidence that rheumatoid arthritis can run in families, although the risk of inheriting the condition is thought to be low as genes are only thought to play a small role in the condition hormones – rheumatoid arthritis is more common in women than men, which may be due to the effects of a hormone called oestrogen that is found at higher levels in women, although this has not been conclusively proven smoking – some evidence suggests that people who smoke are at an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritiswant to know more? national rheumatoid arthritis society (nras):possible causes and risk factorsrheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose because many conditions cause joint stiffness and inflammation and there is no definitive test for the condition.you should see your gp if you have these symptoms so they can try to determine the cause.your gp will carry out a physical examination, checking your joints for any swelling and to assess how easily they move. your gp will also ask you about your symptoms.it is important to tell your gp about all your symptoms, not just ones you think are important, as this will help the doctor make the correct diagnosis.if your gp thinks you have rheumatoid arthritis, they will refer you to a specialist (rheumatologist).your gp may arrangeblood teststo help confirm the diagnosis after conducting a physical examination and consulting your medical history, or they may refer you at the same time as requesting tests.no blood test can definitively prove or rule out a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, but a number of tests can show possible indications of the condition. some of the main tests used are outlined below.in an esr test, a sample of your red blood cells is placed into a test tube of liquid. the cells are then timed to see how fast they fall to the bottom of the tube (measured in millimetres per hour). if they are sinking faster than usual, you may have an inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis.a crp test can indicate if there is inflammation anywhere in the body by checking how much crp is present in your blood. crp is produced by the liver. if there is more crp than usual, there is inflammation in your body.the full blood count will measure your red cells to rule out anaemia. anaemia is a condition where the blood is unable to carry enough oxygen, due to a lack of blood cells.anaemia is common in people with rheumatoid arthritis, although the problem can have many causes, so having anaemia does not prove that you have rheumatoid arthritis.specific blood tests can help to diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, but are not accurate in every person. about half of all people with rheumatoid arthritis have a positive rheumatoid factor present in their blood when the disease starts, but about one in every 20 people without rheumatoid arthritis also tests positive for this.another antibody test known as anti-ccp (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) is also available. people who test positive for anti-ccp are very likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis, but not everybody found to have rheumatoid arthritis has this antibody.those who test positive for both rheumatoid factor and anti-ccp may be more likely to have severe rheumatoid arthritis requiring higher levels of treatment.a number of different scans may also be carried out to check for joint inflammation and damage. these can help differentiate between different types ofarthritisand can be used to monitor how your condition is progressing over time.scans that may be carried out to diagnose and monitor rheumatoid arthritis include: x-rays– where radiation is passed through your body to examine your bones and joints ultrasound scans– where high frequency sound waves are used to create an image of joints magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans– where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of your jointsthere are a number of medications available that can be used to help stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse and reduce your risk of further problems.these are often divided into two types of medication: ‘disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards)’ and ‘biological treatments’.if you have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, you will normally be offered a combination of dmard tablets as part of your initial treatment, as these medications are particularly effective in easing symptoms of the condition and slowing down its progression.dmards work by blocking the effects of the chemicals released when the immune system attacks the joints, which could otherwise cause further damage to nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage.there are many different dmards that can be used, including methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.methotrexate is normally the first medicine given for rheumatoid arthritis, often alongside another dmard and a short-course of corticosteroids to relieve any pain (see below). it may also be combined with the biological treatments mentioned below.common side effects of methotrexate include feeling sick, loss of appetite, a sore mouth,diarrhoea,headachesand hair loss. the medication can also sometimes have an effect on your blood count and your liver, so you will have regularblood teststo monitor this.less commonly, methotrexate can affect the lungs, so you will usually have a chestx-rayand possibly breathing tests when you start taking methotrexate, to provide a comparison if you developshortness of breathor a persistent drycoughwhile taking it. however, most people tolerate methotrexate well.it can take a few months to notice a dmard working. it is important to keep taking the medication, even if you do not notice it working at first.you may have to try two or three types of dmard before you find the one that is most suitable for you. once you and your doctor work out the most suitable dmard, you will usually have to take the medicine in the long term.biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. they include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, rituximab, abatacept and tocilizumab.they are usually taken in combination with methotrexate or another dmard and are normally only used if these medications alone have not been effective.biological medications are given by injection and they work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack your joints.side effects from biological treatments are usually mild and include skin reactions at the site of the injections, infections, feeling sick, a high temperature (fever) and headaches.some people may also be at risk of getting more serious problems, including the reactivation of infections such astuberculosis (tb)in people who have had them in the past.in addition to the medications used to control the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, you may also need to take medication specifically to relieve pain.some of the different medicines that may be used to relieve pain are outlined below.in some cases, you may be advised to use painkillers such asparacetamol, or a combination of paracetamol and codeine (co-codamol) to relieve the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.these medications don’t help treat the underlying inflammation of your joints, but they can sometimes be helpful in relieving pain. for example, they may be recommended while you are waiting to see a specialist or during periods where your symptoms are particularly bad (flare-ups).in addition to – or instead of – the painkillers mentioned above, your doctor may prescribe anon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid).this may be a traditional nsaid (such asibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac) or an alternative type called a cox-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib or etoricoxib).these medications can help relieve pain while also reducing inflammation in the joints, although they will not stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse over time.your doctor will discuss with you what type of nsaid you should take and the benefits and risks associated with each of them.although uncommon, taking an nsaid tablet can increase the risk of serious stomach problems – such as internal bleeding – because the medications can break down the lining that protects the stomach against damage from stomach acids.if you are prescribed an nsaid tablet, you will often have to take another medicine, such as a proton pump inhibitor (ppi), as well. taking a ppi reduces the amount of acid in your stomach, which greatly reduces the risk of damage to your stomach lining.corticosteroidsare powerful medications that can help reduce pain, stiffness and inflammation.they can be used as a tablet (for example, prednisolone), as an injection directly into a painful joint, or as an injection into the muscle (to help lots of joints).they are usually used to provide short-term pain relief – for example, while you are waiting for dmard medication to take effect or during a flare-up.corticosteroids are normally only used in this way because long-term use of corticosteroids can have serious side effects, such as weight gain,osteoporosis(thinning of the bones), easy bruising, muscle weakness and thinning of the skin.your doctor may also refer you to other services that might be able to help you with your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.a physiotherapist may help you improve your fitness and muscle strength, and make your joints more flexible.they may also be able to help with pain relief using heat or ice packs, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens). a tens machine applies a small pulse of electricity to the affected joint, which numbs the nerve endings and can help ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.if rheumatoid arthritis causes you problems with everyday tasks,occupational therapymay help.an occupational therapist can provide training and advice that will help you to protect your joints, both while you are at home and at work.some type of support for your joints, such as a splint, may also be recommended, or devices that can help open jars or turn on taps.if you have problems with your feet, a podiatrist may be able to help. you may also be offered some type of support for your joints or shoe insoles that can ease pain.sometimes, despite medication, damage to your joints may occur. in such cases, you may need surgery to help restore your ability to use your joint.surgery may also be recommended to reduce pain or correct deformities.there are different types of surgery to correct joint problems in the hand. examples include: carpal tunnel release (cutting a ligament in the wrist to relieve pressure on a nerve) release of tendons in the fingers to treat abnormal bending removal of inflamed tissue that lines the finger jointsarthroscopyis a procedure to remove inflamed joint tissue.during the operation, a thin tube with a light source and camera (arthroscope) is inserted into the joint through a small cut in the skin so that the surgeon can see the affected joint.special surgical instruments are inserted through other small cuts in the skin to remove the damaged tissue. you usually do not have to stay overnight in hospital for this kind of surgery, but the joint will need to be rested at home for several days.some people with rheumatoid arthritis will need surgery to replace part or all of a joint, such as the hip, knee or shoulder joint. this is known as a joint replacement or arthroplasty.replacement of these joints is a major operation that involves several days in hospital followed by months of rehabilitation.the latest joints have a limited lifespan of 10-20 years. they are not perfect and some function may not be restored after the damaged joint is replaced by a new one.read more aboutknee replacementandhip replacement.many people with rheumatoid arthritis try complementary therapies, such as: massage acupuncture osteopathy chiropracticin most cases, there is little or no evidence these are effective in the long-term, although some people may experience a short-term benefit from them.there is no strong evidence to suggest that specific dietary changes can help improve rheumatoid arthritis, although some people with rheumatoid arthritis feel that their symptoms get worse after they have eaten certain foods.if you think this may be the case for you, it may be useful to try avoiding problematic foods for a few weeks to see if your symptoms improve. however, it is important to ensure your overall diet is still healthy and balanced.there is also little evidence supporting the use of supplements in rheumatoid arthritis, although some can be useful in preventing side effects of medications you may be taking. for example, calcium and vitamin d supplements may help prevent osteoporosis if you are taking steroids and folic acid supplements may help prevent some of the side effects of methotrexate.however, there is some evidence to suggest that taking fish oil supplements may help reduce joint pain and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis.taking control of rheumatoid arthritis will help you cope with its impact on your lifestyle.arthritis care offers self-management training courses to teach techniques for living positively with arthritis. techniques include relaxation and breathing exercises to help pain control, goal-setting exercises and positive thinking to help give you some control over your condition.a self-management programme specifically for people with rheumatoid arthritis has been developed by the national rheumatoid arthritis society (nras). the course helps people learn more about their condition and provides practical tips on how to manage everyday life.many people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from an individual or group of people with rheumatoid arthritis. patient organisations have local support groups where you can meet others diagnosed with the same condition.call the nras helpline free on 0800 298 7650 to speak to a trained rheumatoid arthritis adviser. nras also has a team of medical advisers.you can also call arthritis care’s free, confidential helpline on 0808 800 4050 (monday-friday, 10am-4pm).it can be hard to deal with the unpredictable nature of rheumatoid arthritis. some days, the pain and stiffness will be much worse than others, and there is no way of knowing when a flare-up will occur.the difficult nature of rheumatoid arthritis can mean that some people developdepressionor feelings of stress and anxiety. sometimes, these feelings can be related to poorly controlled pain or fatigue. living with any long-term condition makes you more likely to have a range of emotions such as frustration, fear, pain, anger and resentment.speak to your healthcare team if you are struggling to deal with your condition emotionally. they may be able to offer medication or psychological interventions to help.if you are taking medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, let your healthcare team know if you want to start a family or if you are worried about becoming pregnant while on medication.some medications, such as methotrexate, leflunomide and biological treatments, should not be taken by men or women while they are trying for a baby. the doctors and nurses will work with you to ensure your rheumatoid arthritis is controlled while you are trying to get pregnant.babies and young children are physically and mentally demanding for any parent, but particularly so if you have rheumatoid arthritis. if you are struggling to cope, it may help to talk to other people in the same situation as you. you may also be able to get additional support from your health visitor or occupational therapist to help you manage your young family.pain, discomfort and changes in the way you feel can affect your sex life. your self-esteem or thoughts about how you look may affect your confidence.although many people find it difficult to talk about such private issues, there are resources that might help you. talking to your partner or gp about the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on your sexuality and sexual relationships may help.if you have to stop work or work part time because of your rheumatoid arthritis, you may find it hard to cope financially.you may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support: if you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled tostatutory sick payfrom your employer. if you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled toemployment and support allowance. if you are aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible for apersonal independence payment. if you are aged 65 or over, you may be able to getattendance allowance. if you are caring for someone with rheumatoid arthritis, you may be entitled tocarer’s allowance.you may also be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.visit thetelecare self-check online toolto find the right support for you in your area.this easy to use online tool allows you to find helpful information on telecare services that could help you live independently at home for longer.having rheumatoid arthritis can put you at a higher risk of developing other conditions, particularly if it isn’t well controlled.carpal tunnel syndromeis a common condition in people with rheumatoid arthritis.it is the result of compression of the nerve that controls sensation and movement in the hands (median nerve) and can cause symptoms such as aching, numbness and tingling in your thumb, fingers and part of the hand.symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome can sometimes be controlled with wrist splints orcorticosteroidinjections, although surgery to release the pressure on the median nerve may be needed in severe cases.as rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition, it can cause inflammation to develop in other parts of your body, such as the: lungs – inflammation of the lungs or lung lining can lead topleurisyorpulmonary fibrosis, which can causechest pain, a persistentcoughandshortness of breath. heart – inflammation of the tissue around the heart can lead to pericarditis, which causes chest pain. eyes – inflammation of the eyes can lead to scleritis orsjogren’s syndrome. scleritis can cause eye redness and pain, whereas sjogren’s syndrome can cause dry eyes. blood vessels – inflammation of the blood vessels is known as vasculitis. this can lead to the thickening, weakening, narrowing and scarring of blood vessel walls. in serious cases, it can affect blood flow to your body’s organs and tissues and can be life-threatening.however, thanks to early treatment, inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis affecting other parts of the body is becoming less common.if rheumatoid arthritis is not treated early or is not well controlled, the inflammation in your joints could lead to significant and permanent damage.problems that can affect the joints include: damage to nearby bone and cartilage (a tough, flexible tissue that covers the surface of joints) damage to nearby tendons (flexible tissue that attach muscle to bone), which could cause them to break (rupture) joint deformitiesthese problems will sometimes need to be treated with surgery to prevent loss of function in the affected joints.if you have rheumatoid arthritis, you are at a higher risk of developingcardiovascular disease (cvd)than the population at large.cvd is a general term that describes conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels, and it includes life-threatening problems such asheart attacksandstrokes.it’s not clear exactly why people with rheumatoid arthritis are at an increased risk of these problems, but you can reduce your risk by ensuring your arthritis is well controlled and by reducing the impact of other factors that contribute to cvd, such as by stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly.read more aboutpreventing cvd.if you have had rheumatoid arthritis for some time, you are at increased risk of developing cervical myelopathy and you may need a special assessment of your neck before any operation where you are put to sleep.this condition is caused by dislocation of joints at the top of the spine, which put pressure on the spinal cord. although relatively uncommon, it is a serious condition that can greatly affect your mobility and can lead to permanent spinal cord damage

       " 'Ringworm and other fungal infections': 'ringworm is a common fungal infection that can cause a red or silvery ring-like rash on the skin. ringworm commonly affects arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on the body. despite its name, ringworm doesn’t have anything to do with worms.other similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails. these fungal infections, medically known as ‘tinea’, are not serious and are usually easily treated. however, they are contagious and easily spread.there are different types of tinea fungal infection, based on the affected area of the body: ringworm (tinea corporis) – affecting the body fungal nail infection (onychomycosis)– affecting the nails athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) – affecting the feet jock itch (tinea cruris) – affecting the groin tinea capitis – affecting the scalpringworm usually looks like a round, red or silvery patch of skin that may be scaly, inflamed and itchy, but other fungal infections may present themselves slightly differently. read more about thesymptoms of ringworm and other tinea fungal infections.see your gp if you or your child has a fungal scalp infection, as it’s treated with antifungal tablets, which are only available on prescription. symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include small patches of scaly scalp skin (which may be sore), patchy hair loss and itchiness. other types of fungal infections (including ringworm) are generally treated with antifungal cream from the pharmacy, and you don’t need to see a doctor unless it persists. however, pharmacists often prefer children to see a gp to confirm a diagnosis.fungal spores are passed between people through direct skin contact and by sharing objects such as towels, hairbrushes and bedding. athlete’s foot is commonly spread in gym and swimming pool changing rooms.pets, such as dogs and cats, can have ringworm, and you can catch it by stroking them.read more about thecauses of ringworm.it’s estimated that 10% to 20% of people will have ringworm in their lifetime.although children are more likely to get this, people of all ages can be affected.groin infections are more common in young men.fungal scalp infections (tinea capitis) are most common in children who have not reached puberty, particularly african-caribbean children and those who live in urban areas.most ringworm infections are mild and can be treated using a pharmacy antifungal cream. scalp infections can be treated with antifungal tablets, sometimes combined with antifungal shampoo. if the skin is irritated or broken, it can lead to other bacterial infections, which may needtreatment with antibiotics. read more abouthow to treat fungal infections.it’s important to prevent the infection spreading. you should avoid sharing towels, bedding or clothes with someone with a fungal infection. if you think your pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. if your pet is treated quickly, you’ll be less likely to catch it. if your child has a fungal infection, they can go to school, but you should inform their teacher. in addition to treatment, your child should maintain a good level of personal hygiene to prevent the infection spreading. read more abouthow to stop the spread of fungal infections.the symptoms of a tinea fungal infection depend on where the infection is.the symptoms of ringworm include: a ring-like red or silvery rash on your skin – your skin will look red and irritated around the ring, but healthy inside scaly, itchy and inflamed skinin more severe cases: the rings may multiply, grow in size and merge together the rings may feel slightly raised and the skin underneath may be itchy blisters and pus-filled sores may form around the ringsthe ring spreads outwards as it progresses. you can have one patch or several patches of ringworm, and in more serious cases, your skin may become raised and blistered.ringworm on the face and neck may not appear ring-shaped, but may be itchy and swollen, and it can become dry and crusted. if you have a beard, you may notice patches of hair breaking away.ringworm on the hand often causes the skin to become thicker on the palm and in between the fingers. it may affect one hand or both and normally only appears on one side.the symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include: small patches of scaly skin on the scalp, which may be sore patchy hair loss an itchy scalpin more severe cases: small, pus-filled sores on the scalp crusting on the scalp bald patches (if your hair is affected)in very severe cases, a large inflamed sore called a kerion may form on your scalp. this can ooze pus, and you may also have a fever and swollen lymph glands.the main symptom of athlete’s foot is an itchy, dry, red and flaky rash, usually in the spaces between your toes. in more severe cases, you may have: cracked skin in the affected area blisters, which may ooze or crust swelling of the skin a burning or stinging sensation in your skin scaling patterns around your sole, between

system, such aschemotherapyor steroid tabletsread more abouthow fungal infections are diagnosed.tinea fungal infections are caused by a particular type of fungi, called dermatophytes, which live off keratin. keratin is a tough, waterproof tissue found in many parts of your body, including your skin, hair and nails. this explains why fungal infections mostly affect your skin, scalp or nails.the fungi are tiny spores tough enough to survive for months on your skin, in soil or on household objects, such as combs or towels. they thrive in heat and moisture, which helps them to grow and explains why they are often spread in swimming pool changing rooms and communal showers. the spores can be spread in four different ways: human-to-human contact human-to-animal contact – for example, by stroking an infected dog or cat human-to-object contact – both animals and humans can leave traces of fungi spores on objects and surfaces, such as towels, clothing, bed linen, combs or brushes human-to-soil contact – less commonly, it can develop after lengthy exposure to infected soilas an adult, you can become a carrier of a scalp infection without developing any symptoms. this is because your body has usually developed a defence against the infection by the time you reach adulthood. if you’re a carrier of a fungal infection, you can unknowingly pass the condition on to children, who may then go on to develop symptoms.you are more likely to develop a fungal infection if you: are very young or very old are african-caribbean (in the case of scalp infections) havetype 1 diabetes are very overweight (obese) have a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such ashiv or aids are receiving medical treatment that weakens your immune system, such aschemotherapyor steroid tablets have had fungal infections in the past have hardened arteries (atherosclerosis) have poor circulation (specifically, a condition called venous insufficiency, where the veins in your legs have trouble moving blood back to your heart)ringworm and other tinea fungal infections are usually easy to diagnose from their appearance and location.your gp will usually be able to diagnose a scalp infection after examining your scalp. knowing exactly which fungus is causing the infection is useful, because some antifungal medications are better at treating certain types. your gp will take a small scraping of skin from your scalp to test in a laboratory. you may be given an antifungal medication before you receive your test results. if the tests show that a different antifungal medication would work better, you will be prescribed that instead.most fungal infections can be diagnosed by your gp after examining your skin and asking whether you have other related symptoms. further tests will usually only be needed if your symptoms are severe or if they fail to respond to antifungal treatment. if this happens, your gp may take a small scraping of affected skin for analysis in a laboratory. microscopic analysis will show if fungi are present and the specific type that is causing your infection. read abouthow to treat ringworm and other fungal infections.most tinea fungal infections, including ringworm, are easily treated by using antifungal creams, tablets or shampoo. you can also help to get rid of fungal infections and stop them from spreading by: washing areas of affected skin daily and drying thoroughly, paying particular attention to skin folds and between your toes in the case of a groin or foot infection, changing your underwear or socks daily, because fungi can persist in flakes of skin with a scalp infection, not sharing combs, hairbrushes or hats washing clothes, towels and bed linen frequently wearing loose-fitting clothes, preferably made of cotton or other natural materialsread more aboutpreventing ringworm.most cases of ringworm, groin infections and athlete’s foot can be treated using an over-the-counter antifungal cream, gel or spray. there are lots of different types, so ask your pharmacist to help you choose the right one for you. you usually apply antifungal creams, gels and sprays daily to the affected areas of skin for 2 weeks. the cream, gel or spray should be applied over the rash and to one inch of skin beyond the edge of the rash. read the manufacturer’s instructions first. you may be advised to use the treatment for a further 2 weeks, to reduce the risk of re-infection. see your gp if your symptoms have not improved after 2 weeks of treatment, because you may need to take antifungal tablets. both terbinafine and griseofulvin tablets can be used to treat ringworm infections, as well as another antifungal medicine called itraconazole.groin infections can sometimes occur at the same time as athlete’s foot. it’s vital to treat both infections at the same time to avoid being re-infected with either condition.scalp infections are usually treated using antifungal tablets, often alongside an antifungal shampoo. there are 2 main types of antifungal tablet: terbinafine griseofulvinthe antifungal medicine that your gp prescribes will depend on the type of fungi causing the infection.most people with fungal scalp infections are prescribed terbinafine tablets to take once a day for 4 weeks. it’s an effective treatment for most cases. side effects of terbinafine can include: nausea diarrhoea indigestion rashesthese side effects are usually mild and short-lived. some people have also reported that terbinafine temporarily affected their sense of taste.terbinafine is not suitable for people with a history ofliver diseaseorlupus(where the immune system attacks healthy tissue).griseofulvin is a type of antifungal medicine that prevents fungi from growing and multiplying. it’s available in the form of a spray and is usually taken daily for 8 to 10 weeks. side effects of griseofulvin can include: nausea vomiting milddiarrhoea headache indigestionhowever, these side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine. griseofulvin can cause birth defects, so it shouldn’t be taken during pregnancy, or if you intend to become pregnant soon after stopping treatment. men shouldn’t father a child within 6 months of stopping treatment. griseofulvin is also not suitable for women who are breastfeeding, and those with severe liver disease or lupus. griseofulvin can interfere with both the combined contraceptive pill and the progestogen-only pill, so women need to use an alternative barrier form of contraception, such as acondom, while taking it. griseofulvin may also affect your ability to drive and can enhance the effects of alcohol.antifungal shampoo cannot cure scalp infections, but it can help to prevent the infection spreading and may speed up recovery. antifungal shampoos, such as selenium sulphide and ketoconazole shampoo, are available from your pharmacist. ideally, antifungal shampoo should be used twice a week during the first 2 weeks of treatment. there is no evidence that shaving a child’s head will reduce the risk of an infection or speed up recovery.itraconazole is usually prescribed in the form of capsules for 7 or 15 days. it is not recommended for use in children, elderly people or those with severe liver disease. side effects of itraconazole can include: nausea vomiting indigestion diarrhoea headacheread abouthow to stop ringworm spreading or coming back.fungal nail infections can be treated with antifungal nail paint, but it also often requires antifungal tablets. these tend to work better than nail paints, although they can cause side effects, such as headache, nausea and diarrhoea. read more abouttreating fungal nail infections.the following advice will help to stop fungal infections from spreading. the fungi that cause tinea infections can survive on items such as furniture, hairbrushes, clothing and towels, and can be spread through contact with these items. therefore, if someone in your household has a fungal infection, you should: avoid sharing personal items – such as combs, hairbrushes, towels, clothing and bed linen avoid scratching the affected areas of your skin or scalp, because it could spread the infection to other parts of your bodyit’s important that other household members check themselves for signs of infection and get treatment if necessary. if you suspect that your pet is the source of the infection, take them to your vet for treatment. patches of missing fur is a sign that an animal has ringworm. always wash your hands after touching a pet with the infection. if someone in your family has a fungal infection, there is no need for them to stay off work or school. however, treatment should be started as soon as possible. good personal hygiene should also be followed to stop it spreading to other children. wearing something on your feet in gym and swimming pool changing rooms will reduce your chances of getting athlete’s foot. find outhow to treat fungal

changes in physical appearance can have a significant psychological impact.symptoms often begin with episodes of flushing, where the skin turns red for a short period, but other symptoms can develop as the condition progresses, such as: burning and stinging sensations permanent redness spots (papules and pustules) small blood vessels in the skin becoming visiblerosacea is a relapsing condition, which means there are periods when symptoms are particularly bad, but less severe at others.read about thesymptoms of rosaceasee your gp if you have persistent symptoms that could be caused by rosacea. early diagnosis and treatment can help stop the condition getting worse.there’s no specific test for rosacea, but your gp will often be able to diagnose the condition by: examining your skin

themenopause. for example, these could be ablood testor skinbiopsy,where a small scraping of skin is removed and examined.the exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of possible factors have been suggested, including abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face and a reaction to microscopic mites commonly found on the face.although they’re not thought to be direct causes of the condition, several triggers have been identified that may make rosacea worse.these include: exposure to sunlight stress strenuous exercise hot or cold weather hot drinks alcohol and caffeine certain foods, such as spicy foodsread aboutcauses of rosaceathere’s currently no cure for rosacea, but treatment can help control the symptoms.long-term treatment is usually necessary, although there may be periods when your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily.for most people, treatment involves a combination of self-help measures and medication, such as: avoiding known triggers – for example, avoiding drinks containing alcohol or caffeine creams and gels – medications applied directly to the skin to reduce spots and redness oral medications – tablets or capsules that can help clear up more severe spots, such as oralantibioticsin some cases procedures such as laser and intense pulsed light (ipl) treatment may be helpful. these involve beams of light being aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin to shrink them and make them less visible.read about more abouttreating rosaceaandself-help measures for rosaceaany long-term (chronic) condition can have an adverse psychological effect, but rosacea can be particularly troublesome as it affects your appearance. this can change how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others.many people with rosacea have reported feelings of low self-esteem, embarrassment and frustration.it’s important to try to come to terms with the fact you have a chronic condition that, although incurable, is controllable.persevering with your treatment plan and avoiding your individual triggers are the best ways of controlling your symptoms.as your physical symptoms improve, you may start to feel better psychologically and emotionally.if you have rosacea, take comfort in knowing you’re not alone. there are millions of people living with the condition in the uk and across the world.you can find support and information from organisations like: changing faces– a charity for people with a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advicespeak to your gp if you’re feelingdepressedas a result of your condition. they may recommend further treatment if necessary.rosacea that affects your eyes (ocular rosacea) can lead to a number of eye problems, some of which can be serious.symptoms of ocular rosacea can include: feeling like there is something in your eyes dry eyes irritated and bloodshot eyes inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis)rosacea can sometimes cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eyeball, to become inflamed and damaged. this is known as keratitis.this damage can make the cornea vulnerable to ulceration and infection, which could potentially threaten your sight.symptoms of serious problems with your corneas include: eye pain sensitivity to light (photophobia) deterioration in your visioncontact your gp immediately if you think you may have a problem with your corneas. if this isn’t possible, visityour nearest accident and emergency (a&e) department.if keratitis isn’t treated promptly by an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions, there’s a risk of permanent vision loss.rosacea causes a range of symptoms, although not everyone will experience them all.most people with rosacea have periods when their symptoms are particularly troublesome, followed by periods when their symptoms are less so.the main symptoms of rosacea include: flushing persistent facial redness visible blood vessels papules and pustules thickened skinthese are discussed in more detail below.other symptoms associated with rosacea include: sensitive skin – burning, itching, stinging and pain dry, rough skin raised red patches (plaques) on your skin facial swelling(lymphoedema)permanent damage to the face (scarring) almost never occurs in rosacea.flushing is when your skin turns red for a short period – usually a few minutes. it tends to mainly affect the face, although it can spread to your neck and chest.in some cases the redness may be accompanied by an unpleasant feeling of heat.in rosacea flushing is often caused by a certain trigger, such as sun exposure, hot drinks or exercise. seecauses of rosaceafor more information about possible triggers.persistent facial redness (erythema) is like a blush or a patch of sunburn that doesn’t go away, or the sort of blotchy skin often associated with drinking too much alcohol.this can be upsetting for those with rosacea as people can mistakenly assume they are heavy drinkers.the redness usually affects the cheeks, nose and chin, but may spread to other areas, such as the forehead, neck and chest.over time the blood vessels in the skin may become permanently widened (dilated) and visible. the medical name for visible blood vessels is telangiectasia.if you have rosacea, you may develop round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules).these spots appear on your face and are similar toacne. rosacea used to be called acne rosacea, but the 2 conditions are quite different.in rosacea there are no blackheads and the skin is not greasy, but dry and peeling. rosacea spots also don’t cause scarring.in the most serious cases of rosacea the skin can thicken and form excess tissue, usually around the nose. this causes the nose to take on a large, bulbous appearance (rhinophyma).rhinophyma is an uncommon, severe symptom of rosacea and takes several years to develop. it almost exclusively affects men.the exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of potential factors have been suggested.it’s possible a combination of these factors may be responsible for the condition, although there isn’t enough evidence to say this for certain.some of the main factors that have been suggested are outlined below.some experts believe abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face may be a major contributing factor for rosacea. this may explain symptoms of flushing, persistent redness and visible blood vessels.it’s not known what causes these abnormalities. but sun damage may be responsible for degeneration of the elastic tissue of the skin and the dilation of blood vessels.recent research has shown external triggers such as ultraviolet (uv) light, spicy food, alcohol (particularly red wine), exercise, stress, heat and cold can lead to the activation of certain molecules within the skin called peptides.increased levels of these peptides may in turn affect the immune system or nerves and blood vessels (neurovascular system) of the skin. activation of these systems can cause dilation of blood vessels, redness and inflammation.microscopic mites called demodex folliculorum usually live harmlessly on human skin, but people with rosacea have particularly large numbers, which may play a role in the condition.it is currently uncertain whether the mite is a cause or an effect of rosacea, although some researchers have suggested the symptoms may be caused by the skin reacting to bacteria in the mites’ faeces.helicobacter pylori bacteria are bacteria found in the digestive system. it’s been suggested these bacteria may be a possible cause of rosacea, although a link hasn’t been proven.one theory is the bacteria may stimulate the production of a protein called bradykinin, which is known to cause blood vessels to expand.rosacea seems to be more common in families, although it’s not clear which genes – if any – are involved or how they’re passed on.although they’re not thought to be direct causes of the condition, many people with rosacea find certain triggers make their symptoms worse.different people can have different triggers, but triggers that have been commonly reported include: exposure to sunlight stress hot or cold weather strong winds strenuous exercise alcohol hot baths spicy foods hot drinks humidity caffeine – found in tea, coffee and cola themenopause dairy products other medical conditions certain medicines – such as amiodarone,corticosteroidsand high doses of vitamins b6 and b12although rosacea can’t be cured, treatment can help keep the symptoms under control.long-term treatment is usually necessary, although there may be periods where your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily.treatment choices depend on which type of symptom is most troublesome, but usually involves a combination of self-help measures and medication, and are outlined below.there are a number of things you can do yourself to help keep the symptoms of rosacea under control, including: avoiding things that trigger your symptoms – for example, by using sun cream and covering yourself up if direct sunlight makes your symptoms worse taking good care of your skin – for example, by using products suitable for sensitive skin using make-up – patches of persistent red skin can be disguised using specially designed camouflage make-up keeping your eyelids clean – if rosacea is causing your eyelids to become inflamed (blepharitis)if you have round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules) caused by rosacea, there are a number of different medications that can be effective.these can be divided into topical treatments that are applied to the skin, or oral treatments, which are taken by mouth.topical medications are usually prescribed first. these include: metronidazole cream or gel azelaic acid cream or gel ivermectin creamivermectin is a relatively new medicine. there’s some evidence to suggest it may be more effective and perhaps less irritating to the skin than metronidazole, although it’s not currently available on the nhs everywhere and may only be recommended if the other treatments don’t work.you’ll usually need to apply these topical treatments once or twice a day, taking care not to get them in your eyes or mouth. it may be several weeks before you notice any significant improvement in your symptoms.side effects of these treatments can include a burning or stinging sensation, itchiness and dry skin.if your symptoms are more severe, an oralantibioticmedication may be recommended as these can help reduce inflammation of the skin.antibiotics often used to treat rosacea include tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and erythromycin.these medications are usually taken for 4 to 6 weeks, but longer courses may be necessary if the spots are persistent.for example, a low-dose doxycycline capsule is available if oral antibiotics need to be taken long term.common side effects of these medications include: feeling and being sick diarrhoea bloating andindigestion tummy (abdominal) pain loss of appetitesome of the medications used can also make your skin sensitive to sunlight and artificial sources of light, such as sun lamps and sunbeds.as with the topical treatments mentioned above, these medications usually need to be taken once or twice a day and you may not notice a significant improvement in your symptoms for several weeks.isotretinoin is a medicine often used to treat severeacne, but at lower doses it’s also occasionally used to treat rosacea.as isotretinoin is a strong medication that can cause a range of side effects, it can only be prescribed by a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist) and not your gp.common side effects of isotretinoin include: dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) or eyes(conjunctivitis) headaches muscle or joint pain back pain blood in your urine (haematuria) mood changesisotretinion can also cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy.treating facial redness and flushing caused by rosacea is generally more difficult than treating papules and pustules caused by the condition.but as well as the self-help measures mentioned above, there are some medications that can help.brimonidine tartrate is a relatively new medication for facial redness caused by rosacea. it comes in the form of a gel that’s applied to the face once a day.the medication works by restricting the widening (dilation) of the blood vessels in your face. research has shown it can start to have an effect about 30 minutes after it’s first used, and this can last for around 12 hours.common side effects of brimonidine tartrate include itchiness and a burning sensation where the gel is applied.less common side effects can include: a dry mouth headaches pins and needles dry skina rebound effect, where flushing becomes worse, has also been reported with this medication.alternatively, there are a number of oral medications that may help improve redness caused by rosacea.these include: clonidine – a medication that relaxes the blood vessels beta-blockers– medications that decrease the activity of the heart anxiety medications – medications sometimes used to help calm the person and reduce blushingit’s not clear how effective these medications are at treating redness caused by rosacea, but they may sometimes be prescribed under the supervision of a dermatologist.redness and visible blood vessels (telangiectasia) can also sometimes be successfully improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (ipl) treatment. these treatments may also improve flushing.a referral to a dermatologist is usually required before having these treatments and they’re not usually available on the nhs, so you may need to pay for them privately. around 2 to 4 treatments may be needed, so the overall cost may be significant.laser and ipl machines produce narrow beams of light that are aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. the heat from the lasers damages the dilated veins and causes them to shrink so they’re no longer visible, with minimal scarring or damage to the surrounding area.laser treatment can cause pain, but most people don’t need an anaesthetic. side effects of laser treatment are usually mild and can include: bruising crusting of the skin swelling and redness of the skin blisters(in rare cases) infection (in very rare cases)these side effects usually only last a few days and are rarely permanent.in some people with rosacea the skin of the nose can become thickened. this is known as rhinophyma.if you have severe rhinophyma, your gp may refer you to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to discuss ways the appearance of your skin can be improved.a number of surgical treatments are available to remove any excess tissue and remodel the nose into a more pleasing shape.this may be done with a laser, a scalpel or specially designed abrasive instruments using a technique called dermabrasion.if rosacea is affecting your eyes (ocular rosacea), you may require further treatment.for example, you may need to use lubricating eye drops or ointment if you have dry eyes, or oral antibiotics if you have blepharitis.if initial treatment isn’t effective or you develop any further problems with your eyes, you’ll need to be referred to an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist for further assessment and treatment.if you have rosacea, there are a number of things you can do to help keep the condition under control.many people with rosacea notice certain triggers make their symptoms worse. although it’s not always practical or possible, taking steps to avoid these triggers can help reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms.if you’re not sure whether your symptoms have a specific trigger, it may be useful to keep a diary to identify whether your symptoms get worse depending on things like the activities you do and foods or drinks you have.advice about how to avoid some common triggers can be found below.as sunlight is the most commonly reported trigger of rosacea, you should use sun cream whenever possible, even when it’s overcast.a sun cream with a sun protection factor (spf) of at least 30 is recommended. a broad-spectrum sun cream that protects against uva and uvb light should be used.using sun creams specifically designed for children may help reduce skin irritation. covering exposed skin with clothes or a sun hat may also help.try to minimise your exposure to the sun during the summer months, particularly in the middle of the day when the sun is at its hottest.but remember, sun can also be strong in the morning and evening, so take adequate precautions at these times as well.stress is also a commonly reported trigger of rosacea. successfully managing your stress levels can help control your symptoms.ways you can reduce stress include: learning relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation and yoga taking regular exerciseas strenuous exercise can sometimes make rosacea symptoms worse, a low-intensity exercise programme, such as walking or swimming, may be better than high-intensity activities, such as running or aerobics.read aboutstress management.some of the most commonly reported food- and drink-related triggers are alcohol and spicy foods. you may want to try completely removing these from your diet to see if your rosacea improves.but there are many other dietary triggers that can also affect some people with rosacea.it’s a good idea to include information about how your diet affects your rosacea symptoms in your rosacea diary.covering your face and nose with a scarf can help protect your skin from cold temperatures and wind.if you need to spend considerable time outside during cold weather, protect your face with a balaclava.the advice below about skincare techniques may also help control your rosacea symptoms. clean your skin every morning and evening using a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser. use soap-free cleansers with non-alkaline or neutral ph. avoid scented soaps and alcohol-based skin cleansers rinse your face with lukewarm water and allow skin to dry thoroughly before you apply medication or make-up look for products suitable for sensitive skin. these are usually described as mild, hypoallergenic, fragrance-free and non-comedogenic (will not block pores) use a moisturiser to soothe skin if it feels sore avoid oil-based or waterproof cosmetics requiring solvents for removal. use water-based make-up and skin products instead avoid astringents, toners and other facial or hair products that contain ingredients that might irritate your skin, such as fragrances, alcohol, menthol, witch hazel, eucalyptus oil, camphor, clove oil, peppermint, sodium lauryl sulphate and lanolin you may want to avoid using anything on your skin that you aren’t sure of. you can then gradually reintroduce products once your symptoms have been treated and cleared to see if you can use them again without any problems men may find that using an electric razor, rather than a blade, helps reduce skin irritation some people find regular gentle facial massage reduces swelling(lymphoedema) don’t use steroid cream unless you’re specifically instructed to by your gp, as it may make your symptoms worseit may be possible to disguise patches of persistent red skin using specially designed camouflage make-up.the charity changing faces offers askin camouflage service, available nationally and free of charge, to help with the use of these creams.your gp or dermatologist can refer you to the skin camouflage service and prescribe skin camouflage make-up.if your eyelids are inflamed as a result of rosacea (blepharitis), cleaning your eyelids every day with warm water and a small amount of cleaning solution can help ease your symptoms.avoiding eye make-up can also help reduce your symptoms, but if you do choose to wear eye make-up, make sure it is a type that washes off easily so you can still clean your eyelids. changing faces',\n",

layer of skin (epidermis), where they lay eggs.after 3 to 4 days, the baby mites (larvae) hatch and move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults.scabies like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock or breast creases. they can also hide under watch straps, bracelets or rings.read more aboutthe life cycle of the scabies mite.scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or through sexual contact.it’s also possible – but rare – for scabies to be passed on by sharing clothing, towels and bedding with someone who’s infected.it can take up to 8 weeks for the symptoms of scabies to appear after the initial infection. this is known as the incubation period.read more about thecauses of scabies.scabies is widespread in densely populated areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas: africa central and south america northern and central australia caribbean islands india southeast asiain developed countries, scabies outbreaks can sometimes occur in places where there are lots of people, such as schools, nurseries and care homes.in the uk, most outbreaks of scabies occur in the winter. this may be because people tend to spend more time indoors and closer to each other at this time of year.it’s difficult to know exactly how many cases of scabies there are in the uk. this is because many people don’t visit their gp and treat the condition with non-prescription medicines.visit your gp if you think you have scabies. it’s not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.the 2 most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and malathion lotion. both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite.permethrin 5% cream is usually recommended as the first treatment. malathion 0.5% lotion is used if permethrin is ineffective.if your partner has been diagnosed with genital scabies, to avoid reinfection you should visit your nearestsexual health clinicso you can be checked and, if necessary, treated.avoid having

to a secondary skin infection if your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through excessive itching.crusted scabies is a rare but more severe form of scabies, where a large number of mites are in the skin. this can develop in older people and those with a lowered immunity.read more aboutcomplications of scabies.the main symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a rash in areas of the body where the mites have burrowed.theitchingis often worse at night, when your skin is warmer. it may take 4 to 6 weeks before the itching starts because this is how long it takes for the body to react to mite droppings.symptoms will start within 1 to 2 days if you’ve had a scabies infection in the past. this is because your immune system will have learned to respond to a scabies infection.the scabies rash consists of tiny red spots. scratching the rash may cause crusty sores to develop.burrow marks can be found anywhere on the body. they’re short (1cm or less), wavy, silver-coloured lines on the skin, with a black dot at one end that can be seen with a magnifying glass.in adults, burrow marks often appear in the following areas: the folds of skin between fingers and toes the palms of the hands the soles and sides of the feet the wrists the elbows around the nipples (in women) around the genital area (in men)the rash usually affects the whole body, apart from the head. the following areas can be particularly affected: the underarm area around the waist the inside of the elbow the lower buttocks the lower legs the soles of the feet the knees the shoulder blades the female genital area the groin around the ankleselderly people, young children and those with a low immune system (immunocompromised) may also develop a rash on their head and neck.men usually have 1 or more very itchy, lumpy, 3 to 10mm spots on the skin of the genitals (on the penis and scrotum).in infants and young children, burrow marks tend to appear in different places on their body, including on the: face head neck scalp palms of the hands soles of the feetscabies mites leave small red blotches and silver-coloured lines on the skin. these marks are caused by the mites burrowing into the skin.in infants with scabies, blisters and pustules (small blisters that contain pus) may develop on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands.scabies is a skin condition caused by the parasite sarcoptes scabiei.the intenseitchingassociated with scabies is thought to be caused by the immune system reacting to the mites and their saliva, eggs and faeces.a scabies infestation starts when a female mite burrows into your skin.male mites move between different burrow sites looking to mate. after mating, the male mite dies and the female begins to lay eggs, which hatch around 3 to 4 days later.after hatching, the young mites move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults after 10 to 15 days. male mites stay on the surface of the skin, while female mites burrow back into the skin to create a new burrow. the life cycle is then repeated.without effective treatment, the life cycle of the scabies mite can continue indefinitely. scabies mites are resistant to soap and hot water and can’t be scrubbed out of the skin.scabies mites can’t fly or jump, which means they can only move from one human body to another if 2 people have direct and prolonged physical contact.for example, scabies mites can be transmitted by: holding hands with an infected person for a prolonged period of time having sex with an infected person sharing clothing, towels and bedding with an infected person (although this is rare)it’s unlikely that scabies will be transmitted through brief physical contact, such as shaking hands or hugging.scabies mites can survive outside the human body for 24 to 36 hours, making infection by coming into contact with contaminated clothes, towels or bed linen a possibility. however, it’s rare for someone to be infected in this way.scabies infestations can spread quickly because people are usually unaware they have the condition until 2 to 3 weeks after the initial infection.there’s an increased risk of catching scabies in confined environments, such as schools and nursing homes, where people are in close proximity to one another.your gp should be able to diagnose scabies from the appearance of your skin, and by looking for the burrow marks of the sarcoptes scabiei mite.however, as scabies is spread very easily, it’s often possible to make a confident diagnosis if more than one family member has the same symptoms.your gp will also want to rule out other skin conditions that may be causing your symptoms, such aseczemaorimpetigo(a highly contagious bacterial skin infection).read more about thesymptoms of scabies.the burrows of scabies mites can be identified by using an ink test. ink is rubbed around an area of itchy skin before being wiped off with an alcohol pad.if scabies burrows are present, some of the ink will remain and will have tracked into the burrows, showing up as a dark line.to confirm the diagnosis, a skin sample may be gently scraped from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope for evidence of scabies mites, their eggs and faeces (poo).visit your gp if you think you have scabies. if you think you have genital scabies or your partner has been diagnosed with it, visityour nearest sexual health clinic, where you’ll be examined and, if necessary, treated.if you decide to treat scabies yourself, you’ll need to have a full sexual health check to make sure you don’t have anysexually transmitted infections (stis).to prevent reinfection, it’s important that all members of your household are treated, as well as any sexual partners you’ve had over the last 6 weeks (in the case of genital scabies). if you’ve had genital scabies in the past, anyone you’ve had sex with in the previous 48 hours will need to be treated.if you’re embarrassed about contacting previous sexual partners, your gp surgery or local sexual health clinic may be able to inform them that they’ve been exposed to scabies on your behalf without disclosing your identity.some sexual health clinics operate on a walk-in basis. others work by appointment only. it’s therefore a good idea to call first.when you attend a clinic, you’ll be asked for your name, date of birth and contact details. these details will be treated confidentially and won’t be passed on to your gp without your agreement.you’ll also be asked about your sexual history, including: when you last had sex whether you usedcondoms whether you’ve had an sti in the past whether you’re taking any medicationif you’re attending a clinic for scabies, you may also be offered tests for stis.see your gp immediately if you have scabies and you haven’t had a previous infection. delaying treatment places other people at risk.as other more serious skin conditions can sometimes cause similar symptoms to thesymptoms of scabies, your gp will need to rule these out.if you have scabies, your partner will also need to be treated regardless of whether or not they have any symptoms. this is because it’s highly likely that scabies will have been transmitted through close bodily contact, such as during sex.to reduce the risk of reinfection, avoid having sex and other forms of prolonged close bodily contact, such as holding hands, until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment.if you’ve been diagnosed with scabies, you may be advised to visit yournearest sexual health clinicto be checked and, if necessary, treated for othersexually transmitted infections (stis).lotions and creams are commonly used to treat scabies. your gp, pharmacist or nurse will be able to advise you about which treatment to use.to prevent reinfection, all members of your household and any close contacts, including recent sexual partners, should be treated at the same time as you, even if they don’t have any symptoms.the cream or lotion should be applied to the skin of all of your body, except your head. before you apply it, make sure your skin is cool and dry. don’t apply it after having a hot bath.if you apply it when your body is hot, it will quickly be absorbed into your skin and won’t remain on the area where the scabies burrows are.when using a cream or lotion to treat scabies, you should also: read the patient leaflet that comes with the cream or lotion for details of where to apply it – some products need to be applied to the whole body, including the scalp and face, whereas others must only be applied from the neck down pay particular attention to difficult-to-reach areas, like your back, the soles of your feet, in between your fingers and toes, under fingernails, and on your genitals use a cotton bud or old toothbrush to apply the treatment under fingernails and toenails – put the cotton bud or toothbrush in a bag and throw it away afterwards leave the treatment on your skin for 8 to 24 hours (depending on the preparation used) before washing it off thoroughly – follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding how long to leave the cream or lotion on for reapply the cream or lotion immediately to any areas of skin that are washed during the period of application wash bed linen, nightwear and towels after the first application repeat the treatment process 7 days after the first application to ensure it’s successful – the second application will ensure any mites hatched from existing eggs are killedit can take a month after treatment for the general itching to subside completely, and longer for the lumpy genital lesions to resolve. your gp may recommend repeating the treatment or they may prescribe a different lotion. the itching hasn’t improved after 2 weeks of treatment and you notice new burrows on your skin you experience any persistent side effectson the day you first apply the cream or lotion, you should wash all bed linen, nightwear and towels at a temperature above 50c (122f).if you’re unable to wash certain items, place them in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. after this time, the scabies mites will have died.in cases of crusted scabies, you should clean the floors in your house and thoroughly vacuum your carpets and furniture, including the armchairs and sofa.if you’ve been diagnosed with scabies, avoid close and prolonged physical contact with others until you’ve applied the cream or lotion. you should also avoid close contact with other members of your household until their treatment has been completed.children and adults can return to school or work after the first treatment has been completed.your gp should be able to prescribe treatments, such as a mild steroid cream, to reduce the itchiness. menthol cream or gel, available from pharmacies without a prescription, may also help relieve itchy skin.oral sedative antihistamines are also available from your local pharmacy and can be used to control itching and help you get a better night’s sleep.as this type of antihistamine can cause drowsiness, you should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you’re affected in this way.non-sedating antihistamines don’t help relieve the itching of scabies. check with your gp or pharmacist if you’re unsure.you may continue to experience itchiness for a couple of weeks after your treatment has been completed. this is because your immune system will still be reacting to the presence of dead mites and their droppings.visit your gp if you’re still experiencing itchiness 6 weeks after completing your treatment.a secondary infection and crusted scabies are 2 possible complications of scabies.repeatedly scratching itchy skin caused by scabies may break the skin’s surface. this will make you more vulnerable to developing a bacterial skin infection, such asimpetigo.antibioticsmay be recommended to control a secondary infection.scabies has been known to make some pre-existing skin conditions, such aseczema, worse. however, other skin conditions should settle down after the scabies infection has been successfully treated.crusted scabies, also known as norwegian scabies, is a more severe form of scabies. this means thousands or even millions of scabies mites are present.normal scabies can develop into crusted scabies after a skin reaction. the condition affects all parts of the body, including your head, neck, nails and scalp. however, unlike normal scabies, the rash associated with crusted scabies usually doesn’t itch.in crusted scabies, the increase in the number of mites causes thick, warty crusts to develop on the skin. it’s often mistaken forpsoriasis(a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales).crusted scabies affects people with a weakened immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness). this includes: the very young people with brain disorders (neurological disorders, such asparkinson’s disease) people with down’s syndrome pregnant women elderly people people with a condition that affects their immune system, such ashiv or aids people who are taking steroids to treat other medical conditions people who are havingchemotherapytreatmentresearch has found a healthy immune system appears to interrupt thereproductive cycle of the scabies mite. for example, most people with scabies will only have 5 to 15 mites on their body at any one time.however, if you have a weakened immune system, the number of scabies mites can increase significantly. people with crusted scabies can have thousands or millions of scabies mites on their body at any one time.because of the high number of scabies mites, crusted scabies is highly contagious. even minimal physical contact with a person with crusted scabies, or with their bed linen or clothes, can lead to infection.however, contact with someone with crusted scabies will only lead to the normal type of scabies in people with a healthy immune system.crusted scabies can be treated using insecticide creams or a medicine called ivermectin, which is taken by swallowing a tablet. ivermectin kills the mites by stopping their nervous system

       " 'Scarlet fever': 'scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that mainly affects children. it causes a distinctive pink-red rash.the illness is caused by streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known asgroup a streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat.scarlet fever usually follows asore throator a skin infection, likeimpetigo, caused by particular strains of streptococcus bacteria.the symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop 2 to 5 days after infection. however, the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as 7 days.you or your child:the distinctive pink-red rash caused by scarlet fever develops 12 to 48 hours after symptoms like a sore throat or headache.red blotches are the first sign of the rash. these turn into a fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch and looks likesunburn. it may also be itchy.on darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent.the rash usually starts on the chest and stomach, but soon spreads to other parts of the body, like the: ears neck elbows inner thighs grointhe rash doesn’t usually spread to the face. however, the cheeks become flushed and the area just around the mouth stays quite pale. the rash will turn white if you press a glass on it.the rash usually fades after about a week, but the outer layers of skin, usually on the hands and feet, may peel for several weeks afterwards.in milder cases, sometimes called scarlatina, the rash may be the only symptom.other symptoms of scarlet fever may include: swollen neck glands loss of appetite nausea or vomiting red lines in the folds of the body, such as the armpit, which may last a couple of days after the rash has gone a white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue red and swollen (this is known as strawberry tongue) a general feeling of being unwellif you think you or your child may have scarlet fever, see your gp for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. it usually clears up after about a weekyour gp should be able to diagnose scarlet fever by examining the distinctive rash and asking about other symptoms. they may also decide to take a sample of saliva from the back of the throat so it can be tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.there’s no evidence to suggest that catching scarlet fever when pregnant will put your baby at risk. however, if you’re heavily pregnant, tell the doctors and midwives in charge of your care if you’ve been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever.scarlet fever is very infectious and can be caught by: breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person’s coughs and sneezes touching the skin of a person with a streptococcal skin infection, such asimpetigo sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linenit can also be caught from people who have the bacteria in their throat or on their skin but don’t have any symptoms.most cases of scarlet fever occur in children under 10 (usually between 2 and 8 years of age). however, people of any age can get the illness.as it’s easily spread, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by streptococcus bacteria. outbreaks can occur in nurseries and schools where children are in close contact with one another.the symptoms of scarlet fever will only develop in people susceptible to toxins produced by the streptococcus bacteria. most children over 10 years of age will have developed immunity to these toxins.it’s possible to have scarlet fever more than once, but this is rare.most cases of scarlet fever clear up after about a week without treatment. however, your gp may recommend treatment as it: reduces the length of time you’re infectious speeds up recovery lowers the risk of complications of scarlet feverwith treatment, most people recover in about 4 to 5 days and can return to nursery, school or work 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment.without treatment, you’ll be infectious for 1 to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.scarlet fever is usually treated with a 10-day course ofantibiotics. this is often in the form of penicillin or amoxicillin tablets, although liquid may be used for young children.for people who are allergic to penicillin, alternative antibiotics like erythromycin can be used instead.the symptoms usually improve within 24 hours of starting antibiotics, with the other symptoms disappearing within a few days. however, it’s important that the whole course of treatment is completed to ensure the infection is fully cleared and reduce the potential forantibiotic resistance.keep your child away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment.adults with scarlet fever should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.many of the symptoms of scarlet fever can be relieved using some simple self care measures. drink plenty of cool fluids eat soft foods (if your throat is painful) take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature use calamine lotion or antihistamines to relieve itchingmost cases of scarlet fever don’t cause complications, particularly if the condition is properly treated.however, there’s a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing more serious infections, like: anear infection a throat abscess (painful collection of pus) sinusitis(inflammation of the sinuses) pneumonia(inflammation of the lungs)very rare complications that can occur at a later stage include: bacteraemia (an infection of the bloodstream) septic arthritis meningitis necrotising fasciitis (a severe infection involving death of areas of soft tissue below the skin) streptococcaltoxic shock syndrome(rapidly progressive symptoms with low blood pressure and multi-organ failure)you or child develop any of these symptoms in the first few weeks after the main infection has cleared up: feeling very unwell severe pain severeheadaches vomiting diarrhoeaif your gp is closed, phone the 111 service.there’s currently no

stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.gps, schools and nurseries should be aware of the current high levels of scarlet fever and inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases, particularly if more than one child is affected. cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing wash your hands with soap and water after using or disposing

developing schizophrenia, and certain situations can trigger the condition.read more about thecauses of schizophrenia.schizophrenia is one of the most common serious mental health conditions. about 1 in 100 people will experience schizophrenia in their lifetime, with many continuing to lead normal lives.schizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. men and women are affected

obvious signs of schizophrenia, but people can experience symptoms in different ways.the symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified into one of two categories – positive or negative. positive symptoms – represent a change in behaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions negative symptoms – represent a withdrawal or lack of function that you would usually expect to see in a healthy person; for example, people with schizophrenia often appear emotionless, flat and apatheticthe condition may develop slowly. the first signs of schizophrenia, such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or experiencing changes in sleeping patterns, can be hard to identify. this is because the first symptoms often develop during adolescence and changes can be mistaken for an adolescent “phase”.people often have episodes of schizophrenia, during which their symptoms are particularly severe, followed by periods where they experience few or no positive symptoms. this is known as acute schizophrenia.if you are experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your gp as soon as possible. the earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.read more information abouthow schizophrenia is diagnosed.a hallucination is when a person experiences a sensation but there is nothing or nobody there to account for it. it can involve any of the senses, but the most common is hearing voices.hallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations.research using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people with schizophrenia when they hear voices. these studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices.some people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they are rude, critical, abusive or annoying. the voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer’s thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. voices may come from different places or one place in particular, such as the television.a delusion is a belief held with complete conviction, even though it is based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. it may affect the way people behave. delusions can begin suddenly, or may develop over weeks or months.some people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they are having. for example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions.someone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe they are being harassed or persecuted. they may believe they are being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend.some people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences. they may believe people on tv or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street.people experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations. some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. they may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a tv programme.people sometimes describe their thoughts as “misty” or “hazy” when this is happening to them. thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand.a person’s behaviour may become more disorganised and unpredictable, and their appearance or dress may seem unusual to others. people with schizophrenia may behave inappropriately or become extremely agitated and shout or swear for no reason.some people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else.another recognised feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind. some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions.the negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often appear several years before somebody experiences their first acute schizophrenic episode. these initial negative symptoms are often referred to as the prodromal period of schizophrenia.symptoms during the prodromal period usually appear gradually and slowly get worse. they include becoming more socially withdrawn and experiencing an increasing lack of care about your appearance and personal hygiene.it can be difficult to tell whether the symptoms are part of the development of schizophrenia or caused by something else. negative symptoms experienced by people living with schizophrenia include: losing interest and motivation in life and activities, including relationships and sex lack of concentration, not wanting to leave the house, and changes in sleeping patterns being less likely to initiate conversations and feeling uncomfortable with people, or feeling there is nothing to saythe negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often lead to relationship problems with friends and family because they can sometimes be mistaken for deliberate laziness or rudeness.the exact causes of schizophrenia are unknown, but research suggests that a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can make people more likely to develop the condition.current thinking is that some people may be prone to schizophrenia, and a stressful or emotional life event might trigger a psychotic episode. however, it’s not known why some people develop symptoms while others don’t.things that increase the chances of schizophrenia developing include:schizophrenia tends to run in families, but no one gene is thought to be responsible. it’s more likely that different combinations of genes make people more vulnerable to the condition. however, having these genes doesn’t necessarily mean you will develop schizophrenia.evidence the disorder is partly inherited comes from studies of twins. identical twins share the same genes. in identical twins, if one twin develops schizophrenia, the other twin has a one in two chance of developing it too. this is true even if they are raised separately.in non-identical twins, who have different genetic make-ups, when one twin develops schizophrenia, the other only has a one in seven chance of developing the condition.while this is higher than in the general population (where the chance is about 1 in a 100), it suggests genes are not the only factor influencing the development of schizophrenia.studies of people with schizophrenia have shown there are subtle differences in the structure of their brains. these changes aren’t seen in everyone with schizophrenia and can occur in people who don’t have a mental illness. but they suggest schizophrenia may partly be a disorder of the brain.these are chemicals that carry messages between brain cells. there is a connection between neurotransmitters and schizophrenia because drugs that alter the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain are known to relieve some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.research suggests schizophrenia may be caused by a change in the level of two neurotransmitters: dopamine and serotonin. some studies indicate an imbalance between the two may be the basis of the problem. others have found a change in the body’s sensitivity to the neurotransmitters is part of the cause of schizophrenia.research has shown that people who develop schizophrenia are more likely to have experienced complications before and during their birth, such as a low birth weight, premature labour, or a lack of oxygen (asphyxia) during birth. it may be that these things have a subtle effect on brain development.triggers are things that can cause schizophrenia to develop in people who are at risk. these include:the main psychological triggers of schizophrenia are stressful life events, such as a bereavement, losing your job or home, a divorce or the end of a relationship, or physical, sexual, emotional or racial abuse. these kinds of experiences, though stressful, do not cause schizophrenia, but can trigger its development in someone already vulnerable to it.drugs do not directly cause schizophrenia, but studies have shown drug misuse increases the risk of developing schizophrenia or a similar illness.certain drugs, particularly cannabis, cocaine, lsd or amphetamines, may trigger symptoms of schizophrenia in people who are susceptible. using amphetamines or cocaine can lead to psychosis and can cause a relapse in people recovering from an earlier episode.three major studies have shown teenagers under 15 who use cannabis regularly, especially “skunk” and other more potent forms of the drug, are up to four times more likely to develop schizophrenia by the age of 26.want to know more? mind:what causes schizophrenia? rethink mental illness:schizophrenia royal college of psychiatrists:cannabis and mental healththere is no single test for schizophrenia. the condition is usually diagnosed after assessment by a specialist in mental health.if you are concerned you may be developing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your gp as soon as possible. the earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.your gp will ask about your symptoms and check they are not the result of other causes, such as recreational drug use.if a diagnosis of schizophrenia is suspected, your gp should refer you promptly to your local community mental health team (cmht).cmhts are made up of different mental health professionals who support people with complex mental health conditions.a member of the cmht team, usually a psychiatrist or a specialist nurse, will carry out a more detailed assessment of your symptoms. they will also want to know your personal history and current circumstances.to make a diagnosis, most mental healthcare professionals use a diagnostic checklist. schizophrenia can usually be diagnosed if: you have experienced one or more of the following symptoms most of the time for a month – delusions, hallucinations, hearing voices, incoherent speech or negative symptoms, such as a flattening of emotions your symptoms have had a significant impact on your ability to work, study or perform daily tasks all other possible causes, such as recreational drug use or bipolar disorder, have been ruled outsometimes it might not be clear whether someone has schizophrenia. if you have other symptoms at the same time, a psychiatrist may have reason to believe you have a related mental illness.there are several related mental illnesses similar to schizophrenia. your psychiatrist will ask how your illness has affected you so they can confidently confirm you have schizophrenia and not another mental illness, such as: bipolar disorder(manic depression) – people with bipolar disorder swing from periods of mania (elevated moods and extremely active, excited behaviour) to periods of deep depression; some people also hear voices or experience other kinds of hallucinations, or may have delusions schizoaffective disorder – this is often described as a form of schizophrenia because its symptoms are similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but schizoaffective disorder is a mental illness in its own right; it may occur just once in a person’s life or recur intermittently, often when triggered by stress.you should also be assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions, such as depression, anxiety and substance misuse.as a result of their delusional thought patterns, people with schizophrenia may be reluctant to visit their gp if they believe there is nothing wrong with them.it is likely someone who has had acute schizophrenic episodes in the past will have been assigned a care co-ordinator. if this is the case, contact the person’s care co-ordinator to express your concerns.if someone is having an acute schizophrenic episode for the first time, it may be necessary for a friend, relative or other loved one to persuade them to visit their gp.in the case of a rapidly worsening schizophrenic episode, you may need to go to the accident and emergency (a&e) department, where a duty psychiatrist will be available.if a person who is having an acute schizophrenic episode refuses to seek help, their nearest relative can request that a mental health assessment is carried out. the social services department of your local authority can advise how to do this.in severe cases of schizophrenia, people can be compulsorily detained in hospital for assessment and treatment under themental health (scotland) act 2015.if you or a friend or relative are diagnosed with schizophrenia, you may feel anxious about what will happen. you may be worried about the stigma attached to the condition, or feel frightened and withdrawn.it is important to remember that a diagnosis can be a positive step towards getting good, straightforward information about the illness and the kinds of treatment and services available.most people with schizophrenia are treated by community mental health teams (cmhts). the goal of the cmht is to provide day-to-day support and treatment while ensuring you have as much independence as possible.a cmht can be made up of and provide access to: social workers community mental health nurses – a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions occupational therapists pharmacists counsellors and psychotherapists psychologists and psychiatrists – the psychiatrist is usually the senior clinician in the teamafter your first episode of schizophrenia, you should initially be referred to an early intervention team. these specialist teams provide treatment and support, and are usually made up of psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, social workers and support workers.people with complex mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia, are usually entered into a treatment process known as a care programme approach (cpa). a cpa is essentially a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs.there are four stages to a cpa: assessment – your health and social needs are assessed care plan – a care plan is created to meet your health and social needs care co-ordinator appointed – a care co-ordinator, sometimes known as a key worker, is usually a social worker or nurse, and is your first point of contact with other members of the cmht reviews – your treatment will be regularly reviewed and, if needed, changes to the care plan can be agreednot everyone uses the cpa. some people may be cared for by their gp, while others may be under the care of a specialist.you will work together with your healthcare team to develop a care plan. the care plan may involve an advance statement or crisis plan, which can be followed in an emergency.your care plan should include a combined healthy eating and physical activity programme and, if you smoke, support for giving up.your care co-ordinator will be responsible for making sure all members of your healthcare team, including your gp, have a copy of your care plan.want to know more? rethink mental illness: care programme approach fact sheet (pdf, 483kb)people who have serious psychotic symptoms as the result of an acute schizophrenic episode may require a more intensive level of care than a cmht can provide.these episodes are usually dealt with by antipsychotic medication and special care.one treatment option is to contact a home treatment or crisis resolution team (crt). crts treat people with serious mental health conditions who are currently experiencing an acute and severe psychiatric crisis. without the involvement of the crt, these people would require treatment in hospital.the crt aims to treat people in the least restrictive environment possible, ideally in or near their home. this can be in your own home, in a dedicated crisis residential home or hostel, or in a day care centre.crts are also responsible for planning aftercare once the crisis has passed to prevent a further crisis from occurring.your care co-ordinator should be able to provide you and your friends or family with contact information in the event of a crisis.more serious acute schizophrenic episodes may require admission to a psychiatric ward at a hospital or clinic. you can admit yourself voluntarily to hospital if your psychiatrist agrees it is necessary.people can also be compulsorily detained at a hospital under themental health (scotland) act 2015. it is only possible for someone to be compulsorily detained at a hospital if they have a severe mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, and if detention is necessary: in the interests of the person’s own health and safety to protect otherspeople with schizophrenia who are compulsorily detained may need to be kept in locked wards.all people being treated in hospital will stay only as long as is absolutely necessary for them to receive appropriate treatment and arrange aftercare.an independent panel will regularly review your case and progress. once they feel you are no longer a danger to yourself and others, you will be discharged from hospital. however, your care team may recommend you remain in hospital voluntarily.if it is felt there is a significant risk of future acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, you may want to write an advance statement.an advance statement is a series of written instructions about what you would like your family or friends to do in case you experience another acute schizophrenic episode. you may also want to include contact details for your care co-ordinator.if you want to make an advance statement, talk to your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or gp.antipsychotics are usually recommended as the initial treatment for the symptoms of an acute schizophrenic episode. they work by blocking the effect of the chemical dopamine on the brain.antipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but may take several days or weeks to reduce other symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts.it’s important that your doctor gives you a thorough physical examination before you start taking antipsychotics, and that you work together to find the right one for you.antipsychotics can be taken orally (as a pill) or given as an injection (known as a depot). several slow-release antipsychotics are available. these require you to have one injection every two to four weeks.you may only need antipsychotics until your acute schizophrenic episode has passed. however, most people take medication for one or two years after their first psychotic episode to prevent further acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, and for longer if the illness is recurrent.there are two main types of antipsychotics: typical antipsychotics – the first generation of antipsychotics developed during the 1950s atypical antipsychotics – newer-generation antipsychotics developed in the 1990sthe choice of antipsychotic should be made following a discussion between you and your psychiatrist about the likely benefits and side effects.both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause side effects, although not everyone will experience them and the severity will differ from person to person.the side effects of typical antipsychotics include: shaking trembling muscle twitches muscle spasmsside effects of both typical and atypical antipsychotics include: drowsiness weight gain, particularly with some atypical antipsychotics blurred vision constipation lack of sex drive dry mouthtell your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or gp if your side effects become severe. there may be an alternative antipsychotic you can take or additional medicines that will help you deal with the side effects.if you do not benefit from one antipsychotic medication after taking it regularly for several weeks, an alternative can be tried. it is important that you work with your treatment team to find the right one for you.do not stop

hallucinations or delusions better. they can also help treat some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy or a lack of enjoyment.psychological treatments for schizophrenia work best when they are combined with antipsychotic medication. common psychological treatments include:cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) aims to help you identify the thinking patterns that are causing you to have unwanted feelings and behaviour, and learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and useful thoughts.for example, you may be taught to recognise examples of delusional thinking. you may then receive help and advice about how to avoid acting on these thoughts.most people will require between 8 and 20 sessions of cbt over the space of 6 to 12 months. cbt sessions usually last for about an hour.your gp or care co-ordinator should be able to arrange a referral to a cbt therapist.many people with schizophrenia rely on family members for their care and support. while most family members are happy to help, caring for somebody with schizophrenia can place a strain on any family.family therapy is a way of helping you and your family cope better with your condition. it involves a series of informal meetings over a period of around six months. meetings may include: discussing information about schizophrenia exploring ways of supporting somebody with schizophrenia deciding how to solve practical problems that can be caused by the symptoms of schizophreniaif you think you and your family could benefit from family therapy, speak to your care co-ordinator or gp.arts therapies are designed to promote creative expression. working with an arts therapist in a small group or individually can allow you to express your experiences with schizophrenia.some people find expressing things

shoulder being higher than the other one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other clothes not hanging properly a prominent ribcage a difference in leg lengthsback pain is common in adults with scoliosis. young people with scoliosis may also experience some discomfort but it’s less likely to be severe.if you or your child have signs of scoliosis, make an appointment to see your gp. they can examine your back and can refer you for anx-rayfor confirmation.if you or your child are diagnosed with scoliosis, it’s important to see a scoliosis specialist to talk about treatment options.read more aboutdiagnosing scoliosis.rarely scoliosis can cause a condition called cauda equina syndrome to develop. cauda equina syndrome is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. if you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team. there has been a new, significant trauma within the last 7 days, for example a fall from height or direct blow to the backor you have experienced a new onset of the following symptoms: loss of feeling/pins and needles between your inner thighs or genitals numbness in or around your back passage or buttocks altered feeling when using toilet paper to wipe yourself increasing difficulty when you try to urinate increasing difficulty when you try to stop or control your flow of urine loss of sensation when you pass urine leaking urine or recent need to use pads not knowing when your bladder is either full or empty inability to stop a bowel movement or leaking loss of sensation when you pass a bowel motion change in ability to achieve an erection or ejaculate loss of sensation in genitals during sexual intercoursein around eight out of every 10 cases, a cause for scoliosis is not found. this is known as idiopathic scoliosis.a small number of cases are caused by other medical conditions, including: cerebral palsy – a condition  associated with brain damage muscular dystrophy – a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness marfan syndrome – a disorder of the connective tissuesrarely, babies can be born with scoliosis, as a result of a problem with the development of the spine in the womb.in adults, age related changes in the discs and joints of the spine and a reduction in bone density may cause scoliosis. adults can also experience worsening over time of previously undiagnosed or untreated scoliosis.read more about thecauses of scoliosis.it used to be thought that scoliosis was only a childhood condition, but it’s now increasingly recognised as a condition that affects older adults as well.it can develop at any age, but is most common in children aged 10-15. in the uk, around three or four in every 1,000 children need treatment for scoliosis.it’s more common in females than males.treatment for scoliosis depends on your age, how severe it is, and whether it’s thought it will worsen with time.in very young children, treatment is not always necessary because the curvature of the spine may improve naturally as they get older. if treatment is necessary, bracing or casting may be used to attempt to halt the curve’s progression.if the infant or younger child’s curve continues to progress despite bracing or casting, an operation may be necessary. this will usually involve inserting metal rods into the back to stabilise the spine, which are lengthened at regular intervals as your child grows.in older children and adults, it is unlikely that scoliosis will improve with time, and in some it may progressively worsen.the main treatments for older children are: a back brace worn until they stop growing, to prevent the spine from curving further surgery to correct the curvature – where the spine is straightened using rods attached to the spine by screws, hooks and/or wiresin adults, treatment primarily aims to relieve any pain. non-surgical options, such as painkillers and exercises are often tried first, with correctional surgery seen as a last resort.read moreabout treating scoliosis in childrenandtreating scoliosis in adults.scoliosis can sometimes lead to further emotional and physical problems.having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. this is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis.if this is a problem for you or your child, you may find it useful to contact a scoliosis support group, such asscoliosis association uk. these groups are a good source of information and support for people with scoliosis.in rare cases, scoliosis can lead to physical problems if it’s severe. for example, significant curvature of the spine can sometimes put increased pressure on the heart and lungs.read more about the possiblecomplications of scoliosis.in most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown and it cannot usually be prevented.it is not thought to be linked with things such as bad posture, exercise or diet.if the cause of scoliosis is unknown, it is called idiopathic scoliosis. about eight out of every 10 cases of scoliosis are idiopathic.however, researchers have found there is a family history of the condition in some idiopathic cases, which suggests a possible genetic link.idiopathic scoliosis can affect adults and children. some cases may only become noticable in later life.in a small number of cases, a cause is identified.some cases of scoliosis are caused by conditions that affect the nerves and muscles (neuromuscular conditions), such as: cerebral palsy – a condition that affects the brain and nerves and occurs during or shortly after birth muscular dystrophy – a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along your nervesscoliosis can also develop as part of a pattern of symptoms called a syndrome. this is known as syndromic scoliosis. conditions that can cause syndromic scoliosis include: marfan syndrome – a disorder of the connective tissues inherited by a child from their parents rett syndrome – a genetic disorder, usually affecting females, which causes severe physical and mental disabilitythese conditions are usually diagnosed at a young age and children with them are often monitored for problems such as scoliosis.in rare cases, babies can be born with scoliosis. this is known as congenital scoliosis. congenital scoliosis is caused by the bones in the spine developing abnormally in the womb.in adults, scoliosis can sometimes be caused by gradual deterioration to the parts of the spine. this is known as degenerative scoliosis.this can occur because some parts of the spine become narrower and weaker (osteoporosis) with age.scoliosis can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination of the spine, ribs, hips and shoulders.you may be asked to bend forward to see if any areas are particularly prominent. for example, one of your shoulders may be higher than the other or there may be a bulge in your back.initial examinations are usually carried out by a gp. if scoliosis is suspected, you should be referred to an orthopaedic specialist (a specialist in conditions that affect the skeleton) for further tests and to discuss treatment.the orthopaedic specialist will take anx-rayto confirm the diagnosis of scoliosis.the x-ray images will also help determine the shape, direction, location and angle of the curve. the medical name for the angle the spine curves is known as the cobb angle.in some cases, scans such as amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanor acomputerised tomography (ct) scanmay also be recommended.if your child has scoliosis, their treatment will depend on their age and how severe it is.the main treatment options are: observation casting bracing surgerythese are described below.there is a separate page abouttreating scoliosis in adults.treatment is not always necessary for very young children because their condition often corrects itself as they grow.however, if the curve does not correct itself, it can reduce the space for the internal organs to develop in, so careful monitoring by a specialist is important.your specialist will usually recommend having regularx-raysto monitor the curvature to see if it improves, stays the same, or gets worse.in some cases affecting young children, the spine may need to be guided during growth in an attempt to correct the curve. in a child aged under two years of age, this can sometimes be achieved by using a cast.a cast is an external brace to the trunk made out of a lightweight combination of plaster and modern casting materials. the cast is worn constantly and cannot be removed, but is changed regularly to allow for growth and remodelling.the cast will be changed underanaestheticevery two to three months with the aim of gradually straightening the spine. however, your child may still need to use a removable brace (see below) after treatment.if the curve of your child’s spine is getting worse, your specialist may recommend they wear a back brace while they are growing. a brace cannot cure scoliosis or correct the curve, but it may stop the curve from getting worse.however, while there is some evidence bracing may be of benefit in certain cases, it’s not recommended by all scoliosis specialists.if a brace is used, it will need to be carefully fitted to your child’s spine. to do this, a cast of your child’s back may need to be taken. this can be done as an outpatient which means that your child will not have to stay overnight in hospital.braces are often made of rigid plastic, although flexible braces are sometimes available. in general, modern back braces are designed so they are difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing.it’s usually recommended that the brace is worn for 23 hours a day, and is only removed for baths and showers. the brace should not interfere with normal everyday activity and can be worn during most non-contact sports. however, it should be removed during contact sports and swimming.regular exercise is important for children wearing a brace. this helps improve muscle tone and body strength, and will help make wearing the brace more comfortable.the brace will usually have to be worn for as long as your child’s body is still growing. for most children, this will mean they can stop wearing it when they are around 16 or 17 years old.if your child has stopped growing and their scoliosis is severe, or other treatments have been unsuccessful, corrective surgery may be recommended. they type of surgery will depend on your child’s age.for younger children, generally those under the age of ten, an operation may be carried out to insert growing rods. these rods aim to allow for continued controlled growth of the spine while partially correcting the scoliosis.after surgery to insert the rods, your child will need to return to their specialist every 4-6 months to have the rods lengthened to keep up with the child’s growth. this procedure will be done through a small incision, and takes place often as a day case or an overnight stay.in some cases, rods that can be lengthened using external magnets during an outpatient appointment may be used. many children will also have to wear a brace to protect the growth rods.when your child stops growing, the adjustable rods can be removed and a spinal fusion (see below) will be carried out.in teenagers and young adults whose spine has stopped growing, an operation called a spinal fusion may be carried out.this is a major operation where the spine is straightened using metal rods attached with screws, hooks, and/or wires, and bone grafts are used to fuse the spine in place. this metalwork will usually be left in place permanently, unless they cause any problems.the surgery will take several hours. after surgery, your child will be transferred to an intensive care unit (icu) or high dependency unit (hdu), where they will be given fluids through a vein (intravenously) and pain relief. most children are well enough to leave intensive care after a day or two, although they will often need to spend another five to 10 days in hospital.after the operation, most children can return to school after a few weeks and can play sports after a few months. contact sports should be avoided for 9-12 months. occasionally a back brace may need to be worn to protect the metal rods after surgery.spinal fusion surgery is a major operation which, like any surgical procedure carries a risk of complications. it will not be recommended unless the surgeon feels the benefits outweigh these risks.some of the main risks the spinal fusion procedure include: bleeding – if this is severe your child may needa blood transfusion wound infection – this can usually be treated withantibiotics the implants moving or the grafts failing to fuse properly – additional surgery may be required to correct this in rare cases, damage to the nerves in the spine – this can lead to permanent numbness in the legs, and can sometimes cause paralysis of the legs and loss of control of the bowels and bladderit’s important that parents and children understand the risks of spinal fusion surgery so that they can make an informed decision about treatment. make sure you discuss the potential complications with your child’s surgeon.there is no reliable evidence to suggest that other therapies such as osteopathy and chiropractic can be used to correct the curvature of the spine or stop it progressing.the role of scoliosis specific exercises is currently under investigation.physiotherapy  may be beneficial when used in combination with a back brace. exercise can help significantly with any muscular pain experienced with scoliosis, and back health in general.back pain is one of the main problems caused by scoliosis in adults, so treatment is mainly aimed at pain relief.in some cases, surgery may be carried out to improve the shape of the spine as a way of helping with back and leg pains.painkilling medication is usually recommended to help relieve the pain that can be associated with scoliosis.over-the-counter painkillers, such asparacetamolandibuprofen, are often recommended initially. see your gp if these don’t work. they may prescribe stronger painkillers or refer you to a specialist pain management clinic.in some cases,corticosteroidsorlocal anaestheticmay be injected into your back to relieve pain caused by the bones in your spine compressing or irritating nearby nerves. however, these injections only work in the short-term and are mostly useful in helping work out where your pain is coming from.if it’s thought thatosteoporosisof your spine is contributing to your symptoms, you may be given medication and supplements to strengthen your bones. read more abouttreating osteoporosis.general strengthening and stretching exercises can improve your general posture and flexibility, and may help control any back pain.exercises can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which can reduce the strain on your back.some people may benefit from physiotherapy, where they are taught specific exercises to carry out.braces are not often used to treat scoliosis in adults, although they can provide pain relief in some cases.a brace may be considered as an alternative to surgery if you are not well enough to undergo an operation.surgery for adults with scoliosis is usually only recommended if the curve in the spine is severe, if it’s getting significantly worse, for back pain related to standing in an abnormal posture, or if the nerves in the spine are being compressed.there are two types of surgery: decompression surgery – if a disc or bone is pressing down on a nerve, it can be removed to reduce the pressure on the nerve spinal fusion surgery – where the position of the spine is improved using metal rods, plates and screws before being fused into place using bone graftsthese are major operations and it can take up to a year or more to fully recover from them. they also carry a risk of potentially serious complications, including: failure to reduce pain – surgery is generally better at relieving pain that radiates to the legs, rather than back pain the implants becoming displaced, broken or loose infection blood clots rarely, damage to the nerves in the spine – in severe cases this can result in permanent leg numbness and the loss of bladder or bowel controlread more aboutlumbar decompression surgery.physical complications of scoliosis are rare, although serious problems can develop if it’s left untreated.having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace may cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. this is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis.modern back braces are designed to be difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing, but your child may still worry that they look different or unusual.encouraging your child to talk with other teenagers who have scoliosis can help improve their confidence and lessen any feelings they are alone with their condition.there are several support groups, such as thescoliosis association uk, that provide information and support for people with scoliosis. some also host message boards so teenagers from across the world can compare experiences, share tips and exchange messages of encouragement.in particularly severe cases of scoliosis the ribcage can be pushed against the heart and lungs, causing breathing problems and making it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body.this can also increase the chances of lung infections, such aspneumonia, and lead to problems such asheart failure.in some cases of scoliosis, particularly those affecting adults, the bones in the spine compress nearby nerves. in severe cases, this can cause problems such as: back and leg pain

       " 'Shortness of breath': 'sudden shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty (dyspnoea), is the most common reason for visiting a hospital accident and emergency department.it’s also one of the most common reasons people phone 999 for an ambulance.it’s normal to get out of breath when you’ve overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it’s usually a warning sign of a medical condition.the information below outlines the most common reasons for:this guide shouldn’t be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what’s causing your breathlessness.you should phone your gp immediately if you have sudden unexpected shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart.your gp will assess you over the phone, and may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. if your shortness of breath is mild or the result of anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit.if you’ve struggled with your breathing for a while, don’t ignore it. see your gp as it’s likely you have a long-term condition, such asobesity,asthmaorchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), which needs to be managed properly.your doctor may ask you some questions, such as: did the breathlessness come on suddenly or gradually? did anything trigger it, such as exercise? how bad is it? does it only happen when you’ve been active, or when you’re not doing anything? is there any pain when you breathe? do you have a cough? do certain positions make it worse – for example, are you unable to lie down?feeling like you can’t get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. you may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed.sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. click on the references at the end for more information about these conditions.sudden breathlessness could be anasthmaattack. this means your airways have narrowed and you’ll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. you’ll feel breathless because it’s difficult to move air in and out of your airways.your gp may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. this delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness.pneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. it’s usually caused by an infection, so you’ll need to takeantibiotics.if you have copd, it’s likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse.it’s possible to have a “silent”heart attackwithout experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety.in this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you’re having a heart attack. if you or your gp think this is the case, they’ll give youaspirinand admit you to hospital straight away.heart failurecan also cause breathing difficulties. this life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. it leads to a build-up of fluid inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult.a combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness.breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate).apanic attackor anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag can bring your breathing back to normal but should only be done when you are certain anxiety is the cause of your breathlessness.these include: a severe allergic reaction(anaphylaxis) pneumothorax – partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs pulmonary embolism – a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis– a rare and poorly understood lung condition that causes scarring of the lungs pleural effusion – a collection of fluid next to the lung diabetic ketoacidosis – a complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urinelong-term breathlessness is usually caused by: obesityor being unfit poorly controlledasthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)– permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking anaemia– a low level of oxygen in the blood caused by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen) heart failure– when your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate)more unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are: bronchiectasis– a lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough pulmonary embolism – a recurrent blockage in a blood vessel in the lung partial collapse of your lung caused bylung cancer pleural effusion – a collection of fluid next to the lung narrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body frequentpanic attacks, which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths) heart failure shortness of breath asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease home oxygen treatment asthma uk',\n",
       " 'Sickle cell disease': 'sickle cell disease is the name for a group of blood disorders. the most severe is sickle cell anaemia. these disorders are inherited, meaning they are passed on through your genes.you can have a blood test at any time to find out if you carry the gene for sickle cell disease, or if you have sickle cell disease.sickle cell disease affects how your body produces red blood cells. normal red blood cells are round – red blood cells affected by sickle cell disease harden and become sickle-shaped, like a crescent moon. this causes them to die too quickly and block blood vessels, leading to symptoms that are often painful.people from particular ethnic backgrounds are more likely to have sickle cell disease or carry the gene. you are more likely to have sickle cell disease if you are from one of these ethnic backgrounds: african asian caribbean eastern mediterranean middle easternthere are treatments to manage sickle cell disease, but no cure yet – it’s a lifelong condition.find out about symptoms and diagnosisfind out about treating sickle cell diseasefind out about living with sickle cell diseasefind out about screening to see if you’re a sickle cell carrierthe main symptoms of sickle cell disease are sickle cell crises (very painful episodes affecting different parts of the body), infections, and anaemia.there are a number of serious problems that can appear suddenly as a result of sickle cell disease. if you experience any of the following symptoms, you should get medical advice immediately: high temperature (a fever) going to 38c (100.4f) or higher difficulty breathing drowsiness, confusion, or slurred speech a severe headache, stiff neck, or dizziness skin or lips that are very pale fits (seizures) serious pain that isn’t responding to treatments at home sudden swelling in the tummy priapism – a painful erection lasting two hours or more weakness on one or both sides of your body sudden vision loss, or changes in your visionif you develop any of the symptoms listed above, phone your gp or care team immediately. if you can’t contact your gp or care team, go to your closest accident and emergency (a&e) department. dial 999 for an ambulance if you aren’t able to travel yourself.it’s important to make sure that the medical team looking after you know that you have sickle cell disease.episodes of pain known as sickle cell crises happen when the blood vessels that go to one part of your body become blocked. the pain can be severe.sickle cell crises are one of the most common symptoms of sickle cell disease and, on average, occur once a year and last up to seven days. some people have sickle cell crises every few weeks – others experience them less than once a year.a sickle cell crisis typically affects one part of the body at a time. the most common parts affected are: hands or feet (this is especially common in young children) ribs and breastbone spine pelvis tummy legs and armssickle cell crises have different causes. they can be triggered by cold, rainy or windy weather, stress, dehydration, or exercise that leaves you severely out of breath.sickle cell disease leaves people – especially children – extra vulnerable to infection because their bodies aren’t as effective at dealing with bacteria and viruses. this leaves them more vulnerable to viruses like the common cold, as well as severe and potentially life-threatening conditions like meningitis.as well as keeping up to date with their vaccinations, many people with sickle cell disease take daily doses of antibiotics in order to prevent infections.almost everyone with sickle cell disease has anaemia. haemoglobin is found in red blood cells – it’s the substance that transports oxygen around the body. people with anaemia have low levels of haemoglobin in their blood.most of the time anaemia doesn’t cause symptoms, but if you’re infected with parvovirus, the virus that causes slapped cheek syndrome, the anaemia can get worse. when that happens, it causes: headaches a fast heartbeat fainting dizzinessif these symptoms occur, the anaemia is usually treated with a blood transfusion.sudden anaemia can happen in young children if they experience swelling of the spleen. this is also treated with a blood transfusion.there’s a wide range of other issues that can be caused by sickle cell disease. these include: a serious lung condition called acute chest syndrome that can cause chest pain, a cough, breathing difficulties and fever pain in bones and joints delayed puberty delayed growth in childhood kidney or urinary problems, including bedwetting and blood in the urine gallstones – these are stones in the gallbladder that can cause jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) and abdominal (tummy) pain ulcers on the lower legs (open sores that can be very painful) priapism – a painful, persistent erection that can last for several hours high blood pressure (pulmonary hypertension) transient ischaemic attacks (tias) or strokes – these happen when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or blocked enlarged spleen – this can cause a fast heartbeat, worsening of anaemia, a swollen tummy, shortness of breath and abdominal pain vision problems like floaters, worsened night vision, blurred vision, patchy vision and, occasionally, sudden vision lossthese symptoms can be treated – seetreating sickle cell diseasefor more information.you can have a blood test any time to find out if you have sickle cell disease, or find out if you’re a carrier who could have a child with the condition.sickle cell disease is usually diagnosed during pregnancy – free screening to find out if a baby is at risk of having the condition is offered to every pregnant woman in scotland.even if your family background doesn’t make it likely your child will have sickle cell disease, you can still request a test.if possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there’s time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.newborn babies are screened for sickle cell disease as part of the newborn blood spot test – the heel prick test. there are a few reasons for this: if a baby’s parents weren’t screened during pregnancy, this test identifies if the child has sickle cell disease if screening during pregnancy showed that the baby had a high risk of having sickle cell disease, but no more testing was done, the heel prick test will determine if the child has the condition or not this test shows if the baby is a carrier of sickle cell, and could one day have children of their own who have the condition (find out more about sickle cell carriershere) the heel prick test identifies other inherited conditions, like cystic fibrosisanother blood test will be used to confirm the diagnosis if the heel prick test suggests that the baby could have sickle cell disease.learn about being tested to see if you carry the sickle cell genepeople of all ages with sickle cell disease are supported by a team of medical professionals in a specialist sickle cell centre. a specialised care plan will be developed with you that helps you to fully understand the condition and find the best way of managing it.sickle cell crises can usually be managed at home. the following steps are recommended for adults or children experiencing a sickle cell crisis: over the counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen can help – although aspirin should not be given to anyone under 16 – and if needed, your gp may prescribe stronger painkillers heating pads or warm towels can be placed on the area and massaged to ease the pain – pharmacies usually sell heating pads you can use for this drink plenty – staying hydrated will help relaxing distractions like reading, videos, and computer games are a good way to distract your mind, or your child’s mind, from the painif none of the above measures help, or the pain is very severe, phone your gp. you or your child should go to the local accident and emergency (a&e) if it’s not possible to contact your gp. it may be necessary for you or your child to spend a few days in hospital being treated with stronger pain relief.the best way to prevent a sickle cell crisis is by being aware of potential triggers and avoiding them. prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids –especially water. avoid alcohol – alcohol causes dehydration. stay warm with enough layers of clothing to avoid getting cold, and avoid extreme temperatures. don’t expose yourself to sudden changes in temperature – for example, avoid swimming in cold water. the lack of oxygen at high altitudes can trigger a sickle cell crisis, so be careful if you’re at high altitude for any reason. however, plane travel shouldn’t be an issue because planes maintain a consistent oxygen level due to being pressurised. make sure to stay active, but avoid activities that leave you severely out of breath. don’t smoke – smoking can trigger acute chest syndrome. stay relaxed as much as you can – sickle cell crises can be triggered by stress, so consider learning relaxation techniques likebreathing exercises.your care team may recommend a medication called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) if you keep experiencing sickle cell crises. this is a capsule that is taken once a day. it works by reducing how many other types of blood cell, like white blood cells and platelets (clotting cells) there are in the body.this means that you’ll need regular blood tests to make sure you’re healthy.children who have sickle cell disease should be kept up to date on all of their routine vaccinations, and may also need additional vaccinations like the hepatitis b vaccine and the annual flu vaccine.if you have sickle cell disease, you’ll most likely need to take a dose of antibiotics every day, usually penicillin. this will not pose serious health risks.reduce risk in day-to-day life by being careful about activities that can make you vulnerable to infection. always followgood food hygiene measures, for example.if you’re planning to go abroad, talk to your gp as far in advance as you can. you might needextra vaccinationsor medication, such as anti-malarials if you’re going to a place wheremalariais a risk. it may also be a good idea to take extra precautions when it comes to food and water.most of the time, anaemia doesn’t have any symptoms and you won’t require any treatment for it. however, children with sickle cell anaemia who are also on a restricted diet (such as a vegan or vegetarian diet) may need folic acid supplements. folic acid helps your body to create more red blood cells, so it can help to improve anaemia.it’s important to be aware that this type of anaemia isn’t the same as the anaemia caused by iron deficiency, so don’t take iron supplements without talking to your care team first. taking iron supplements with the anaemia caused by sickle cell disease can be dangerous.blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide may be necessary for serious or persistent anaemia.there are a range of treatments for other problems that can be caused by sickle cell disease, depending on the type of symptom and how severe it is: people with acute chest syndrome need emergency treatment – this involves oxygen, blood transfusions, antibiotics, and fluids given through a vein, as well as possibly hydroxycarbamide to prevent it happening again painkillers can treat joint and bone pain a short course of hormones can be given to children in order to trigger delayed puberty gallbladder removal surgery is used to treat gallstones for persistent priapism, medication can stimulate blood flow, or a needle can be used to drain blood from the penis regular blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide are given to people who have had a stroke or who are at greater risk of having onein addition to the treatments above, chelation therapy involves taking medication to make the level of iron in your blood lower, bringing it to safe levels. this treatment is given to people who need a lot of blood transfusions.learn more about living with sickle cell disease heresickle cell disease is a lifelong illness, which can be managed well with treatment and self-help. in addition to preventing symptoms and crises as much as possible, there are a few things you can do that will make it easier to live with the condition and stay in the best possible health.if you’re due to have surgery, or you’re brought in for surgery in an emergency, it’s very important you take some precautions.you should tell your care team about any surgeries you have planned that involve a general anaesthetic.tell your surgeon on the day that you have sickle cell disease.general anaesthetic can cause a number of problems, including increasing the risk of a sickle cell crisis. it’s important that you’re monitored closely during the surgery, and are given plenty of fluids as well as being kept warm.it might be necessary to have a blood transfusion before the surgery to reduce the chances of complications.you can have a healthy pregnancy if you have sickle cell disease, but it’s a good idea to talk to your care team before planning a pregnancy, for a number of reasons: there’s a bigger chance of complications such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, anaemia and sickle cell pain while you’re pregnant you may have to stop taking some of the medications for sickle cell disease, like hydroxycarbamide, before getting pregnant, as these can harm a foetus it may be a good idea to find out if your partner is a sickle cell carrier and talk with a counsellor about what this could mean extra monitoring during pregnancy, as well as extra treatment, might be necessaryit’s important to use a reliable form ofcontraceptionif you aren’t planning a pregnancy.learn about pregnancy and newborn screening for sickle cell diseasemost children with sickle cell disease lead normal, happy lives. however, sickle cell disease can be very different from person to person, and it’s still a serious condition.sickle cell disease can have a big impact on someone’s life. it can lead to serious infections, strokes and transcient ischaemic attacks (tias), and lung problems, which can be fatal.the overall live expectancy for people with sickle cell disease is shorter than normal, but this changes depending on the type of sickle cell disease, what problems they experience, and how the condition is treated.milder types of sickle cell disease may not impact life expectancy. people with sickle cell anaemia have a typical life expectancy of between 40 and 60 years of age. as newer treatments are developed, it’s hoped that the outlook will get better.sickle cell disease is caused by a gene problem that is inherited from your parents. it isn’t something you can catch, and it’s not caused by anything the parents did during or before pregnancy.you inherit one set of genes from your mother, and one from your father. genes always come in pairs. children born with sickle cell disease inherit a copy of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, so each one of the pair of genes is faulty.this happens when both parents are “carriers” – they carry the faulty gene for sickle cell. this is also known as having the sickle cell trait.carriers don’t have sickle cell disease, but if their partner is a carrier too they may have a child with the condition.when both of a child’s parents are sickle cell carriers: there’s a 25% (one in four) chance that each of their children won’t inherit any faulty genes – they won’t have sickle cell disease, and they won’t be able to pass it on to their children there’s a 50% (one in two) chance that each child will inherit a copy of the faulty gene from just one parent, and be a sickle cell carrier there’s a 25% (one in four) chance that each child will inherit copies of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, and have sickle cell disease when they’re bornyou can find more information about how sickle cell disease is inherited from thesickle cell society.learn more about sickle cell carriers and screeningsickle cell disease carriers are people who carry the faulty gene that causes sickle cell disease, but do not have the disease. this is also called having the sickle cell trait.if you have the sickle cell trait, you won’t develop sickle cell disease. however, there’s a risk that you’ll have a child with the condition, or who is also a sickle cell disease carrier.the sickle cell gene can be carried by anyone, but people from certain ethnic backgrounds are much more likely to be carriers.you are more likely to be a carrier if you have family from one of these areas : africa asia the caribbean the eastern mediterranean the middle eastmost sickle cell carriers in the uk have an african or caribbean family background – it’s estimated around one in ten people with this background may be a sickle cell carrier.you can request a blood test from your gp at any time to find out if you’re a sickle cell carrier. this is a particularly good idea if your family background makes it more likely that you have the gene.both men and women are able to get the test.every pregnant woman in scotland is offered screening to check if their baby is at risk of being born with sickle cell disease. you can ask for a test even if your family background doesn’t suggest your child will have sickle cell disease. it’s a good idea to have your partner screened for the gene too.if possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there’s time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.read more about diagnosis and screening for the sickle cell disease gene hereyou’re not at risk of developing sickle cell disease if you carry sickle cell.the only time you may be at risk of health problems is in rare cases where you might not get enough oxygen, such as: having surgery undergeneral anaesthetic– make sure your medical team know you carry sickle cell before your operation so they can ensure you get enough oxygen during extreme sports such as deep sea diving and climbing at high altitudes – if you do sports like these, ensure you’re never short of oxygen during regular, intensive physical activity – make sure you drink plenty of fluids during training and avoid extreme exhaustionthere’s also a very small risk of developing kidney problems associated with carrying sickle cell.apart from these uncommon situations, you can lead a completely normal and healthy life if you’re a sickle cell carrier.sickle cell carriers are also at risk of having a child with a blood disorder if their

or heart abnormalities. any pregnancy will be closely monitored for potential problems.read more about thecomplications of sjögren’s syndromesjögren’s syndrome most commonly affects people aged 40-60, with women accounting for about 90% of cases.it’s difficult to know exactly how many people are affected by the syndrome because many don’t see their gp about their symptoms.further information onsjögren’s syndromeif you have sjögren’s syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the national congenital anomaly and rare diseases registration service (ncardrs).this helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. you can opt out of the register at any time.find out more about the registerthe most commonly reported symptoms of sjögren’s syndrome are a dry mouth and eyes, which can lead to other associated symptoms.however, these symptoms can be common in old age, and most people with dry eyes or a dry mouth do not have sjögren’s syndrome.many women also experience vaginal dryness, which can make sex painful.adry mouthcan lead to: tooth decayandgum disease drycough difficulty swallowing and chewing hoarse voice difficulty speaking swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and ears) repeated fungal infections in the mouth (oral thrush) – symptoms of which can include a coated or white tonguedry eyes can lead to: burning or stinging eyes itchy eyes a feeling that there’s grit in your eyes irritated and swollen eyelids sensitivity to light (photophobia) tired eyes mucus discharge from your eyesthese symptoms can get worse when you’re: in a windy or smoky environment in an air-conditioned building travelling on aeroplanein more serious cases of sjögren’s syndrome, the immune system can attack other parts of the body, causing symptoms and conditions such as: dry skin tiredness and fatigue – which are common and can lead to total exhaustion muscle pain joint pain, stiffness and swelling vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) difficulty concentrating, remembering and reasoningit’s not known exactly what causes sjögren’s syndrome, but it’s thought to be linked to a problem with the immune system.your immune system usually helps protect the body from infection and illness by making antibodies. antibodies attack bacteria and viruses, which help stop you from becoming ill.an autoimmune condition causes your immune system to react abnormally. instead of attacking foreign cells, such as bacteria, the antibodies start attacking your body’s healthy cells and tissue.in sjögren’s syndrome, the parts of the body usually affected are the tear, saliva and vaginal glands, which are collectively known as the exocrine glands.the antibodies damage the exocrine glands so they can no longer function normally. there’s some evidence that the immune system also damages the nerves that control these glands, which further reduces their effectiveness.the immune system can go on to damage other parts of the body, such as muscles, joints, blood vessels, nerves and, less commonly, organs.most researchers believe that primary sjögren’s syndrome is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.certain people are born with specific genes that make them more vulnerable to a faulty immune system. then, many years later, an environmental factor, possibly a common virus, triggers the immune system to stop working properly.the female hormone oestrogen also seems to play a role. sjögren’s syndrome mostly occurs in women, and symptoms usually start around the time of themenopause, when oestrogen levels begin to fall. falling oestrogen levels can contribute to dryness, and this dryness could make the condition more noticeable.sjögren’s syndrome can be associated with other autoimmune conditions, such asrheumatoid arthritisorlupus. this is known as secondary sjögren’s syndrome.your saliva and tear glands play a vital role in protecting your mouth and eyes, which is why the symptoms of sjögren’s syndrome can be widespread and troublesome.we usually only notice our tears when we cry, but our eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, known as a tear film.tears are made up of a mix of water, proteins, fats, mucus and infection-fighting cells. tears serve several important functions. they: lubricate the eye keep the eye clean and free of dust protect the eye against infection help stabilise your visionsaliva also serves several important functions, including: keeping the mouth and throat naturally lubricated aiding digestion by moistening food and containing enzymes that can break down certain starches acting as a natural disinfectant (saliva contains antibodies, enzymes and proteins that protect against some common bacterial and fungal infections)sjögren’s syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other health conditions.you may see different health professionals for your different symptoms, such as a dentist for adry mouth, an optician for dry eyes and a gynaecologist for a dry vagina, which can sometimes make it difficult to reach a firm diagnosis.see your gp if you experience any symptoms of dryness, particularly of your eyes and mouth.experts in the field have come up with a series of screening questions, which may be useful if you’re worried you may have sjögren’s syndrome.if you answer “yes” to most of the questions below, you may have sjögren’s syndrome and will probably be advised to have further tests. have you had daily, persistent, troublesome dry eyes for more than three months? do you keep having a sensation of grit in your eye? do you need to use eye drops containing tear substitutes more than three times a day? have you had a daily feeling of dry mouth for more than three months? do you keep getting swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and your ears)? do you frequently drink liquids to help you swallow food?tests used to diagnose sjögren’s syndrome include: tear break-up time and schirmer tests a lip biopsy blood tests salivary flow ratethese are explained below.tear break-up time and schirmer tests are usually carried out by an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions).the tear break-up time test measures how effective your tear glands are. a non-toxic dye is dropped onto the surface of your eye and the colour of the dye allows the ophthalmologist to see how well your tear film is functioning and how long it takes for your tears to evaporate.this test is also carried out using a slit lamp. a slit lamp is a low-power microscope with a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine in a narrow beam. the specialist will use the slit lamp to examine your tear glands more closely.in the schirmer test, small strips of blotting paper are placed into your lower eyelid. after five minutes, the strips are removed to see how much of the paper is soaked with tears.during a lipbiopsy, a small tissue sample is removed from your inner lip and examined under a microscope. alocal anaestheticis injected into the inner surface of your lower lip to numb the area, before a small cut is made to remove a few of your minor salivary glands.clusters of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the tissue can indicate sjögren’s syndrome.blood testsare carried out to look for antibodies known as anti-ro and anti-la (or ss-a and ss-b), which are produced when the immune system has been affected by sjögren’s syndrome.these antibodies are only present in about 60% of people with sjögren’s syndrome, so it’s possible to have a negative blood test result and still have the condition.a salivary flow rate test measures how much saliva your glands produce.you’ll usually be asked to spit as much saliva as you can into a cup over a five-minute period. the amount of saliva is then weighed or measured. an unusually low flow rate can indicate sjögren’s syndrome.there’s no cure for sjögren’s syndrome, but treatments help relieve symptoms such as eye and mouth dryness.sjögren’s syndrome affects everyone in different ways, so your treatment plan will be tailored to suit you.mild to moderate cases of dry eye can usually be successfully treated with eye drops containing “artificial tears” – a liquid that mimics tears. these eye drops are available from a pharmacist, without a prescription.there are many different types of eye drops, so you can try different brands to find the one that works best for you. if you’re using eye drops regularly (more than three times a day), you should use one that doesn’t contain preservatives. this is because there’s evidence that over-exposure to preservatives can damage the surface of the eye.a short-term dose of eye drops containingcorticosteroidsmay be recommended if your eyes become irritated. however, long-term corticosteroid use isn’t recommended because they can cause serious side effects.to minimise the chance of experiencing side effects from corticosteroids, you’ll be prescribed the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.wearing glasses reduces tear evaporation by up to 30%, and this effect can be maximised by wearing specially-made glasses called moisture chamber spectacles. these wrap around your eyes like goggles and help retain moisture and protect the eyes from irritants.some people used to be embarrassed to wear them, but modern designs look like sports glasses.punctual occlusion is a widely-used technique that seals the tear ducts (into which the tears drain) with small plugs. this should help keep the eye better protected by tears.temporary plugs made of silicone are usually used first to see if they help. if it does, more permanent plugs can be used.a number of techniques can be used to keep your mouth lubricated, including: maintaining good oral hygiene toprevent tooth decayandgum disease increasing your fluid intake using sugar-free chewing gum to stimulate saliva production sucking ice cubes to help lubricate your mouth and reduce dryness regularly using mouth rinses to soothe your mouth and protect it against infectionif you smoke, you should try to quit. smoking irritates the mouth and increases the rate at which saliva evaporates.read more abouthow to stop smokingthere are a number of saliva substitute products that can help lubricate your mouth. however, they don’t replicate the role of saliva in preventing infection, so you’ll still need to maintain excellent oral hygiene.saliva substitutes are available as a spray, lozenge (medicated sweet), gel, or gum. your gp or pharmacist can tell you which product is most suitable for you.the medicine pilocarpine is often used to treat thesymptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth. pilocarpine stimulates the glands to produce more saliva and tears.side effects of pilocarpine include: hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) nausea diarrhoea heartburn abdominal (stomach) pain an increased need to go to the toiletfor some people, the side effects of pilocarpine are mild. others find that the side effects outweigh the benefits.don’t take pilocarpine if you haveasthmaorchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), or if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.hydroxychloroquine has been shown to slow down the immune system’s attack on the tear and saliva glands. it can also help reduce any associated symptoms of muscle pain, joint pain and stiffness.you’ll need to take hydroxychloroquine for several weeks before you notice any improvements, and it could be six months before you experience the full benefit of the treatment.side effects are uncommon and usually mild. they include: nausea skin rash loss of appetite stomach cramps vomitingin very rare cases, hydroxychloroquine can damage the retina, affecting vision. you’ll probably be asked to attend an eye examination so that your retina can be checked before you start treatment. regular eye examinations (usually at least once a year) are also recommended after you begin treatment.hydroxychloroquine shouldn’t be used by breastfeeding women.several soaps and creams are specifically designed for people with dry skin. your pharmacist or gp can advise you.vaginal dryness can be treated using a lubricant. some women also use oestrogen creams orhormone replacement therapy (hrt).muscle and joint pains can be treated with an over-the-counternon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid), such asibuprofen. if this doesn’t work, see your gp, as stronger nsaids are available on prescription.nsaids can increase your risk of developingstomach ulcersand internal bleeding, particularly if they’re taken on a long-term basis.if you find swallowing nsaids difficult because of your dry mouth, you can try an nsaid cream that’s rubbed into affected joints.nsaids aren’t recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for people with pre-existing risk factors for cardiovascular or kidney conditions.these simple tips can help prevent many of the problems associated with sjögren’s syndrome: have a dental check-up every six months practise good dental hygiene – brushing, flossing and using mouthwash regularly avoid eating too many sweet foods avoid strong and perfumed soaps – use special creams and soaps from your pharmacist avoid dry environments, such as air-conditioned offices, whenever possible avoid drinking too muchalcoholsjögren’s syndrome isn’t usually life-threatening, but it is linked to more seriousproblems.it’s estimated that people with sjögren’s syndrome are 44 times more likely to developnon-hodgkin lymphomathan people without the condition.non-hodgkin lymphoma is acancerof the lymphatic system. the lymphatic system is a series of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) that are spread throughout your body, much like your blood vessels.while this increased risk may sound alarming, the chance of a person with sjögren’s syndrome developing non-hodgkin lymphoma is still small, as it only affects around 5% of people with the syndrome.however, if you have sjögren’s syndrome, you should be aware of the main early symptom of non-hodgkin lymphoma, which is a painless swelling in a lymph node (gland) – usually in the neck, armpit or groin. report any swollen lymph nodes to your gp.if dry eyes aren’t treated, they can become inflamed and you can develop ulcers on the surface of your eyes (corneal ulcers).if left untreated, corneal ulcers can lead to loss of vision and permanent sight damage.if you’re planning to become pregnant and have sjögren’s syndrome, ask your gp to test for certain antibodies that may be present in sjögren’s syndrome and are known to cause a temporarylupusrash in newborn babies. in very rare cases, the antibodies can also cause heart defects in babies.if these antibodies are found, there should be no reason why you can’t continue with the pregnancy, but your child may need additional specialist care during pregnancy and after the birth.read more aboutantenatal appointmentsa number of other conditions have been linked to sjögren’s syndrome, including: peripheral neuropathy– a

       " 'Skin cancer (melanoma)': 'melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body.the most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing mole. this can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected.in most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than 1 colour. they may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed.an ‘abcde checklist’ has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma.read more about thesymptoms of melanoma.these pages mainly cover a type of melanoma known as superficial spreading melanoma, which accounts for around 70% of all melanomas in the uk.nodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. it may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren’t regularly exposed to the sun.lentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. it is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years.acral lentiginous melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. this is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin.cancer research uk has more information about thedifferent types of melanoma.melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. it’s thought that exposure to ultraviolet (uv) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible.certain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having: lots of moles or freckles pale skin that burns easily red or blonde hair a family member who has had melanomaread more about thecauses of melanoma.speak to your gp if you notice any change to your moles. your gp will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma.in most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and studied to see if it is cancerous. this is known as abiopsy.you may also have a test to check if the melanoma has spread elsewhere in your body. this is known as a sentinel node biopsy.read more aboutdiagnosing melanoma.the main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances.if melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an early stage, surgery is usually successful.if melanoma isn’t diagnosed until an advanced stage, treatment is mainly used to slow the spread of the cancer and reduce symptoms. this usually involves medicines, such aschemotherapy.read more abouttreating melanoma.once you have had melanoma, there is a chance it may return. this risk is increased if your cancer was widespread and severe.if your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your melanoma returning, you will probably need regular check-ups to monitor your health. you will also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns.melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the uk.more than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. it’s also becoming more common in the uk over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to uv light from the sun and sunbeds.melanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to uv light.you can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided.regularly checking your moles and freckles can help lead to early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.the first sign of a melanoma is often a new mole or a change in the appearance of an existing mole.normal moles are usually round or oval, with a smooth edge, and no bigger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.speak to your gp as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months.signs to look out for include a mole that is: getting bigger changing shape changing colour bleeding or becoming crusty itchy or painfula helpful way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the abcde checklist: asymmetrical – melanomas have 2 very different halves and are an irregular shape border – melanomas have a notched or ragged border colours – melanomas will be a mix of 2 or more colours

body, but they most commonly appear on the back, legs, arms and face. they may sometimes develop underneath a nail.in rare cases, melanoma can develop in the eye. noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be diagnosed during a routine eye examination.read further information: cancer research uk:melanoma symptomsmost skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (uv) light damaging the dna in skin cells. the main source of uv light is sunlight.sunlight contains 3 types of uv light: ultraviolet a (uva) ultraviolet b (uvb) ultraviolet c (uvc)uvc is filtered out by the earth’s atmosphere, but uva and uvb damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. uvb is thought to be the main cause of skin cancer.artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer.repeatedsunburn, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, increases the risk of melanoma in people of all ages.you are at an increased risk of melanoma if you have lots of moles on your body, especially if they are large (over 5mm) or unusually shaped.having just 1 unusually shaped or very large mole increases your risk of melanoma by 60%.for this reason, it’s important to monitor moles for changes and avoid exposing them to the sun.research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.certain things are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including: pale skin that does not tan easily red or blonde hair blue eyes older age a large number of freckles an area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment a condition that suppresses your immune system – such ashiv medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) – commonly used after organ transplants exposure to certain chemicals – such as creosote and arsenic a previous diagnosis of skin cancerread further information: cancer research uk: melanoma risks and causes.a diagnosis of melanoma will usually begin with an examination of your skin. your gp will refer you to a specialist if they suspect melanoma.some gps take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment.as melanoma is a relatively rare condition, many gps will only see a case every few years. it’s important to monitor your moles and return to your gp if you notice any changes. taking photos to document any changes will help with diagnosis.in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of malignant melanoma and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected malignant melanoma, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.you will be referred to a dermatology clinic or hospital for further testing if melanoma is suspected. you should see a specialist within 2 weeks of seeing your gp.the dermatologist or plastic surgeon will examine the mole and the rest of your skin. they may also remove the mole and send it for testing (biopsy) to check whether the mole is cancerous. a biopsy is usually carried out underlocal anaesthetic, meaning the area around the mole will be numbed and you won’t feel any pain.if cancer is confirmed, you will usually need a further operation, most often carried out by a plastic surgeon, to remove a wider area of skin.further tests will be carried out if there is a concern the cancer has spread into other organs, bones or your bloodstream.if melanoma spreads, it will usually begin spreading through channels in the skin (called lymphatics) to the nearest group of glands (called lymph nodes). lymph nodes are part of the body’s immune system, helping to remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body.sentinel lymph node biopsy is a test to determine whether microscopic amounts of melanoma (less than would show up on any x-ray or scan) might have spread to the lymph nodes. it is usually carried out by a specialist plastic surgeon, while you are undergeneral anaesthetic.a combination of blue dye and a weak radioactive chemical is injected around your scar. this is usually done just before the wider area of skin is removed. the solution follows the same channels in the skin as any melanoma.the first lymph node this reaches is known as the ‘sentinel’ lymph node. the surgeon can locate and remove the sentinel node, leaving the others intact. the node is then examined for microscopic specks of melanoma (this process can take several weeks).if the sentinel lymph node is clear of melanoma, it’s extremely unlikely that any other lymph nodes are affected. this can be reassuring because if melanoma spreads to the lymph nodes, it’s more likely to spread elsewhere.if the sentinel lymph node contains melanoma, there is a risk that other lymph nodes in the same group will contain melanoma.your surgeon should discuss the pros and cons of having a sentinel lymph node biopsy before you agree to the procedure. sentinel lymph node biopsy does not cure melanoma, but is used to investigate the outlook of your condition.an operation to remove the remaining lymph nodes in the group may be recommended. this is known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.other tests you may have include: acomputerised tomography (ct) scan amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan a positron emission tomography (pet) scan blood testsread further information: cancer research uk:melanoma tests cancer research uk:further tests for melanomahealth professionals use a staging system to describe how far melanoma has grown into the skin (the thickness) and whether it has spread. the type of treatment you receive will depend on what stage the melanoma has reached.the melanoma stages can be described as: stage 0 – the melanoma is on the surface of the skin stage 1a – the melanoma is less than 1mm thick stage 1b – the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick, or the melanoma is less than 1mm thick and the surface of the skin is broken (ulcerated) or its cells are dividing faster than usual (mitotic activity) stage 2a – the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick, or the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick and is ulcerated stage 2b – the melanoma is thicker than 4mm, or the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick and ulcerated stage 2c – the melanoma is thicker than 4mm and ulcerated stage 3a – the melanoma has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, but they are not enlarged; the melanoma is not ulcerated and has not spread further stage 3b – the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes but they are not enlarged, or the melanoma is not ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread to small areas of skin or lymphatic channels, but not to nearby lymph nodes stage 3c – the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread into 4 or more lymph nodes nearby stage 4 – the melanoma cells have spread to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, brain or other parts of the skinread further information: cancer research uk:treating melanoma cancer research uk:stages of melanoma macmillan:melanomatreating stage 1 melanoma will involve surgically removing the melanoma and a small area of skin around it – this is known as surgical excision.surgical excision is usually carried out underlocal anaesthetic. this means you will be awake but the area around the melanoma will be numbed, so you won’t feel pain. in some cases,general anaestheticis used, which means you will be asleep during the procedure.if a surgical excision is likely to leave a significant scar, it may be done in combination with a skin graft. a skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually taken from a part of your body where scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. it is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. skin grafts or flaps are used when the area of skin being removed is too big to close using a direct method.once the melanoma has been removed, there is little possibility it will return and no further treatment should be required. you will probably be asked to come for follow-up appointments before being discharged.as with stage 1 melanomas, any affected areas of skin will be removed. the remaining skin is either closed directly, or a skin graft or flap may be carried out if necessary.sentinel node biopsy, which is not a mandatory procedure, will be discussed with you. if you decide to go ahead with the procedure and the results show no spread to nearby lymph nodes, it is unlikely you will have further problems with this melanoma.if the test confirms melanoma has spread to nearby nodes, your specialist will discuss with you whether further surgery is required. additional surgery involves removing the remaining nodes, known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.if the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes, you may need further surgery to remove them. your doctor will have felt a lump in your lymph nodes and the diagnosis of melanoma is usually confirmed using a needle biopsy (fine needle aspiration). removing the affected nodes requires a procedure called a block dissection, performed under general anaesthetic.while the surgeon will try to ensure the rest of your lymphatic system can function normally, there is a risk that the removal of lymph nodes will disrupt the lymphatic system, leading to a build-up of fluids in your limbs. this is known aslymphoedema.once the melanoma has been removed, you will need follow-up appointments to see how you are recovering and to watch for any sign of the melanoma returning.you may be offered treatment to try to prevent the melanoma returning. this is called adjuvant treatment. there is not much evidence that adjuvant treatment helps prevent melanoma from coming back, so this is only offered as part of a clinical trial.it may not be possible to cure melanoma if it has: been diagnosed at its most advanced stage spread to another part of your body (metastasis) come back in another part of your body after treatment (recurrent cancer)treatment is available and given in the hope that it can slow the cancer’s growth, reduce any symptoms you may have and possibly extend your life expectancy.you may be able to have surgery to remove other melanomas that have occurred away from the original site.you may also be able to have other treatments to help with symptoms. these include: radiotherapy drug treatmentsradiotherapymay be used after an operation to remove your lymph nodes, and can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of advanced melanoma.radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. it is given at the hospital as a series of 10 to 15 minute daily sessions, with a rest period over the weekend.the side effects of radiotherapy include: tiredness nausea loss of appetite hair loss sore skinmany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe, so let them know about any that you experience. after treatment has finished, the side effects of radiotherapy should gradually reduce.read further information: cancer research uk:radiotherapy for melanoma.in recent years there have been major advancements in treating melanoma. the medications used to treat melanoma are changing as new formulations are being introduced into clinics.the medications currently being used include: vemurafenib ipilimumab nivolumabhowever, not everyone is suitable for these drugs. your specialist will discuss an appropriate treatment with you, and many people are entered into clinical trials.chemotherapyinvolves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to kill the cancer. it is normally used to treat melanoma that has spread to parts of the body and is mainly given to help relieve symptoms of advanced melanoma.several different chemotherapy drugs are used to treat melanoma and are occasionally given in combination. the drugs most commonly used for melanoma are dacarbazine and temozolomide. however, many different types of drugs can be used. your specialist can discuss with you which drugs are the most suitable.chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. dacarbazine is given through a drip and temozolomide is given in tablet form. chemotherapy sessions are usually given once every 3 to 4 weeks, with gaps between treatment intended to give your body and blood time to recover.the main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on the rest of the body. side effects include infection, nausea and vomiting, tiredness and sore mouth. many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.electrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for melanoma. it may be considered if: surgery isn’t suitable or hasn’t worked radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven’t workedthe procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein). short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes.these electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour. the procedure is usually carried out using general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep) but some people may be able to have local anaesthetic (where you’re awake but the area is numbed).depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. the main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers.it usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated.your specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option.read the nice (2013) guidelines onelectrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin.immunotherapy uses drugs (often derived from substances that occur naturally in the body) that encourage your body’s immune system to work against the melanoma. two such treatments in regular use for melanoma are interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. both are given as an injection (into the blood, under the skin, or into lumps of melanoma).side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as chills, a high temperature, joint pain and fatigue.there is ongoing research into producing a vaccine for melanoma, either to treat advanced melanoma or to be used after surgery in patients who have a high risk of the melanoma coming back.vaccines are designed to focus the body’s immune system so it recognises the melanoma and can work against it. vaccines are usually given as an injection under the skin every few weeks, often over a period of months.as more research is needed into vaccines, they are only given as part of a clinical trial.our immune systems make antibodies all the time, usually as a way of controlling infections. they are substances that recognise something which doesn’t belong in the body and help to destroy it. antibodies can be produced in the laboratory and can be made to recognise and lock onto specific targets, either in the cancer or in specific parts of the body.antibodies produced in the laboratory are usually called monoclonal antibodies.ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been licensed for use in the uk since 2011. it works like an accelerator for the immune system, allowing the body to work against all sorts of conditions, including cancer.in december 2012, nice recommended ipilimumab as a possible treatment for people with previously treated advanced melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.signalling inhibitors are drugs that work by disrupting the messages (signals) a cancer uses to co-ordinate its growth. there are hundreds of these signals, and it is difficult to know which ones need to be blocked. most of the signals have short, technical names. two that are of current interest in relation to melanoma are braf and mek.there are drugs available that can interfere with these signals, but most are currently only widely available as part of clinical trials.nice recommends a signalling inhibitor called vemurafenib as a possible treatment for melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.read further information: cancer research uk:biological therapy for melanoma. cancer research uk:chemotherapy for melanoma.all new treatment for cancer (and other diseases) is first given to patients in a clinical trial.a clinical trial or study is an extremely rigorous way of testing a drug on people. patients are monitored for any effects of the drug on the cancer, as well as side effects. many people with melanoma are offered entry into clinical trials, but some people are

       " 'Skin cancer (non-melanoma)': \"skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin.the term ‘non-melanoma’ distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known asmelanoma, which spreads faster in the body.the first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn’t heal after a few weeks.in most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly.speak to your gp if you have any skin abnormality that hasn’t healed after 4 weeks. although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure.read more about thesymptoms of non-melanoma skin cancernon-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop.the 2 most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are: basal cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers squamous cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancersalthough not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratoses andbowen’s diseasemay sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.non-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (uv) light. uv light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps.in addition to uv light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as: a family history of the condition pale skin that burns easily a large number of moles or frecklesread more about thecauses of non-melanoma skin cancernon-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. it affects slightly more men than women.your gp can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. they may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer.your gp may refer you urgently, within 2 weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. basal cell skin cancers usually don’t need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks.the specialist will examine your skin again and will perform abiopsyto confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer.a biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope.read more aboutdiagnosing non-melanoma skin cancersurgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. this involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin.other treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (pdt).treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is generally successful as, unlike most other types of cancer, there is a considerably lower risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.it is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. the risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2 to 5% of cases.treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is completely successful in approximately 90% of cases.read more abouttreating non-melanoma skin cancerif you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. the chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe.if your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. you will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours.non-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to uv light.you can help protect yourself fromsunburnby using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun and limiting the time you spend in the sun during the hottest part of the day.sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided.regularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.read more aboutsunscreen and sun safetythe main symptom of non-melanoma skin cancer is the appearance of a lump or discoloured patch on the skin that doesn’t heal.the lump or discoloured patch is the cancer, sometimes referred to as a tumour.non-melanoma skin cancer most often appears on areas of skin which are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands and shoulders.basal cell carcinoma (bcc) usually appears as a small red or pink lump, although it can be pearly-white or ‘waxy’ looking. it can also look like a red, scaly patch.the lump slowly grows and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer.squamous cell carcinoma (scc) appears as a firm pink lump and may have a flat, scaly and crusted surface.the lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer.bowen’s disease is a very early form of skin cancer, sometimes referred to as ‘squamous cell carcinoma in situ’. it develops slowly and is easily treated.the main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin which may itch. it most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. however, it can appear on any area of the skin.if you develop a lump, lesion or skin discolouration that hasn’t healed after 4 weeks, speak to your gp. while it is unlikely to be cancer, it is best to be sure.read further information: cancer research uk:skin cancer symptoms macmillan:symptoms of skin cancermost skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (uv) light damaging the dna in skin cells. the main source of uv light is sunlight.sunlight contains 3 types of uv light: ultraviolet a (uva) ultraviolet b (uvb) ultraviolet c (uvc)uvc is filtered out by the earth’s atmosphere but uva and uvb damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. uvb is thought to be the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer.artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer.repeatedsunburn, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, will make your skin more vulnerable to non-melanoma skin cancer.research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.certain factors are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including: pale skin that does not tan easily red or blonde hair blue eyes older age a large number of moles a large number of freckles an area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment a condition that suppresses your immune system, such ashiv medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants), commonly used after organ transplants exposure to certain chemicals, such as creosote and arsenic a previous diagnosis of skin cancerread further information: cancer research uk:skin cancer risks and causes. macmillan:risk factors and causes of skin cancer.a diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer will usually begin with a visit to your gp who will examine your skin and decide whether you need further assessment by a specialist.some gps take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment.in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of skin cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected skin cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.if skin cancer is suspected, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or specialist plastic surgeon. the specialist should be able to confirm the diagnosis by carrying out a physical examination.however, they will probably also perform abiopsy– a surgical procedure where either a part or all of the tumour is removed and studied under a microscope. this is usually carried out under alocal anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area will be numbed so you won’t feel pain.this allows the dermatologist or plastic surgeon to determine what type of skin cancer you have and whether there is any chance the cancer could spread to other parts of your body.sometimes, skin cancer can be diagnosed and treated at the same time. in other words, the tumour can be removed and tested and you may not need further treatment because the cancer is unlikely to spread.it may be several weeks before you receive the results of a biopsy.if you have basal cell carcinoma (bcc), then you usually won’t require further tests, as the cancer is unlikely to spread.however, in rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, further tests may be needed to make sure the cancer has not spread to another part of your body.these tests may include a physical examination of your lymph nodes (glands found throughout your body). if cancer has spread, it may cause your glands to swell.if the dermatologist or plastic surgeon thinks there is a high risk of the cancer spreading, it may be necessary to perform a biopsy on a lymph node. this is called a fine needle aspiration (fna).during fna, cells are removed using a needle and syringe so they can be examined. finding cancerous cells in a nearby lymph node would suggest the squamous cell carcinoma has started to spread to other parts of your body.surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer, although it may depend on your individual circumstances.overall, treatment is successful for more than 90% of people with non-melanoma skin cancer.people with cancer should be cared for by a team of specialists that often includes a dermatologist, a plastic surgeon, an oncologist (a radiotherapy and chemotherapy specialist), a pathologist and a specialist nurse.if you have non-melanoma skin cancer, you may see several (or all) of these professionals as part of your treatment.when deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider: the type of cancer you have the stage of your cancer (how big it is and how far it has spread) your general healthyour cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. for example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has produced healthcare guidelines about nhs skin cancer services. these outline nice’s main recommendations on how, over the coming years, people with skin cancer or melanoma should be treated.read further information: nice:improving outcomes for people with skin tumours including melanomasurgical excision is an operation to cut out the cancer along with surrounding healthy tissue to ensure the cancer is completely removed.it may be done in combination with a skin graft, if it’s likely to leave significant scarring. a skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually from a part of your body where any scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. it is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area.in many cases, this operation is enough to cure skin cancer.curettage and electrocautery is a similar technique to surgical excision, but is only suitable for cases where the cancer is quite small.the surgeon will use a small, spoon-shaped blade to remove the cancer and an electric needle to remove the skin surrounding the wound. the procedure may need to be repeated two or three times to ensure the cancer is completely removed.cryotherapy uses cold treatment to destroy the cancer. it is sometimes used for non-melanoma skin cancers in their early stages. liquid nitrogen is used to freeze the cancer, and this causes the area to scab over.after about a month, the scab containing the cancer will fall off your skin. cryotherapy may leave a small white scar on your skin.mohs micrographic surgery (mms) is used to treat non-melanoma skin cancers when: it’s felt there is a high risk of the cancer spreading or returning the cancer is in an area where it would be important to remove as little skin as possible, such as the nose or eyesit involves removing the tumour bit by bit, as well as a small area of skin surrounding it. this minimises the removal of healthy tissue and reduces scarring.each time a piece of tissue is removed, it is checked for cancer. the procedure may need to be repeated 2 or 3 times to ensure the cancer is completely removed.chemotherapy involves using medicines to kill cancerous cells. in the case of non-melanoma skin cancer, chemotherapy is only recommended when the tumour is contained within the top layer of the skin.this type of chemotherapy involves applying a cream containing cancer-killing medicines to the affected area. as only the surface of the skin is affected, you will not experience the side effects associated with other forms of chemotherapy, such as vomiting or hair loss. however, your skin may feel sore for several weeks afterwards.photodynamic therapy (pdt) is used to treat basal cell carcinoma, bowen’s disease and actinic keratoses. it involves using a cream which makes the skin highly sensitive to light.after the cream has been applied, a strong light source is shone onto the affected area of your skin, which kills the cancer. pdt may cause a burning sensation and around 2% of people who have this treatment will be left with some superficial scarring.imiquimod cream is a treatment for basal cell carcinoma with a diameter of less than 2cm (0.8 inches). it’s also used to treat actinic keratoses. imiquimod encourages your immune system to attack the cancer in the skin.common side effects of imiquimod include redness, flaking or peeling skin and itchiness.less common and more serious side effects of imiquimod include blistering or ulceration of your skin.wash the cream off and contact your gp if your skin blisters or you develop ulcers after using it.radiotherapy involves using low doses of radiation to destroy the cancer. the level of radiation involved is perfectly safe. however, your skin may feel sore for a few weeks after radiotherapy.radiotherapy is sometimes used to treat basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas if: surgery would be unsuitable the cancer covers a large area the area is difficult to operate onradiotherapy is sometimes used after surgical excision to try to prevent the cancer coming back. this is called adjuvant radiotherapy.electrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. it may be considered if: surgery isn’t suitable or hasn’t worked radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven’t workedthe procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein). short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes.these electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour. the procedure is usually carried out using general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep) but some people may be able to have local anaesthetic (where you’re awake but the area is numbed).depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. the main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers.it usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated.your specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option.read the nice (2013) guidelines onelectrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin.read further information:

       " 'Soft tissue sarcomas': \"soft tissue sarcomas are a group of rare cancers affecting the tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures and organs.tissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments.soft tissue sarcomas can develop in almost any part of the body, including the legs, arms and the trunk (torso).there are many different types of soft tissue sarcoma, depending on where in the body they are located. for example:soft tissue sarcomas account for around 1 in every 100 cancers diagnosed in the uk.cancer develops when cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumours.in the vast majority of soft tissue sarcomas it’s unclear what causes this to happen but there are a number of factors known to increase the risk, including: age – soft tissue sarcomas can occur at any age, including in children, but they are more common in middle-aged or elderly people and your risk increases as you get older certain genetic conditions – some genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and retinoblastoma, are associated with an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas previousradiotherapy– some people who have previously had radiotherapy for another type of cancer develop a soft tissue sarcoma, often many years after their previous treatment exposure to certain chemicals – exposure to some chemicals, including vinyl chloride, dioxins and phenoxyacetic herbicides, has been associated with increased rates of soft tissue sarcomasone particular type of soft tissue sarcoma calledkaposi’s sarcoma– which develops in skin cells – is caused by a virus known as the human herpesvirus type 8 (hhv-8) infecting someone with a weakened immune system (such as people withhiv).as soft tissue sarcomas can develop in most parts of the body, they can cause a wide range of symptoms.for example, a tumour near the stomach may causeabdominal (tummy) pain, a feeling of fullness andconstipation, whereas a tumour near the lungs may cause acoughorbreathlessness.there are often no obvious symptoms in the early stages of soft tissue sarcomas, although you may notice a soft, painless lump under your skin or deeper, that can’t easily be moved around and gets bigger over time.you should speak to your gp if you have a worrying lump or any other troublesome symptoms. a lump the size of a golf ball or larger should be regarded as suspicious and needs to be investigated urgently.although it is much more likely you have a benign (non-cancerous) condition, it is important to get your symptoms checked out.if your gp feels there is a possibility you do have cancer, they will refer you for a number of hospital tests to confirm whether you have a soft tissue

soft tissue sarcomas, although other scans may also be carried outif a diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma is confirmed, these tests will also help determine how far the cancer has spread (known as the ‘stage’) and how aggressive the cancer is (known as the ‘grade’).if you’re diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma your care team of specialist doctors and nurses will help you decide on the most appropriate treatment.treatment depends on factors such as the stage and grade of the cancer, the location of any tumours, and your age and general health.the main treatments used are: surgery – to remove any tumours radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells chemotherapy– where medication is used to kill cancer cellssurgery is the main treatment for soft tissue sarcomas that are detected at an early stage.it involves removing the cancerous tumour along with a section of surrounding healthy tissue. this will help ensure no cancer cells are left behind.every effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and functionality of the affected body part.but there is a possibility you’ll have some difficulty using the part of the body that is operated on after surgery and sometimes reconstructive plastic surgery may be needed to repair significant damage.in a small number of cases, there may be no option but toamputatethe part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg.radiotherapy is often used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells. this is carried out using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at a defined treatment area.radiotherapy may also sometimes be used before surgery to make a tumour easier to remove, or as part of your treatment to reduce your symptoms if surgery is not possible.common side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, tiredness and hair loss in the treatment area. these tend to get better within a few days or weeks of treatment finishing.read more about theside effects of radiotherapylike radiotherapy, chemotherapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. this involves being given anti-cancer medication directly into a vein (intravenously).chemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that cannot be surgically removed.chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body’s cells, and can cause a number of temporary but unpleasant side effects, such as feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss from several parts of the body.read more about theside effects of chemotherapyas with most types of cancer, the outlook for a soft tissues sarcoma depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced when it is diagnosed.if the cancer is detected at an early stage and can be removed during surgery, there is a possibility it can be cured.but you’ll need regular check-ups following treatment to check for any signs the cancer has come back. you may also need long-term physiotherapy andoccupational therapyto help you manage any physical difficulties resulting from surgery.a cure is not usually possible if a soft tissue sarcoma is only detected at a late stage when it has already spread to other parts of the body, although treatment can help slow the spread of the cancer and control your symptoms.read

       " 'Soft tissue sarcomas: Teenagers and young adults': 'this section is for teenagers and young adults. it’s about a type of cancer called soft tissue sarcoma.there are several different types of soft tissue sarcoma. the information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas, soft tissue ewing’s sarcoma and fibrosarcomas. these are the most common types in teenagers. if you have a different type and want to know more, contactmacmillan.if you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our generalsoft tissue sarcomasection.soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body. there are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are: rhabdomyosarcomas synovial sarcomas soft tissue ewing’s sarcoma fibrosarcomassarcomas can also develop in the bones. this is called osteosarcoma.the symptoms of a sarcoma will depend on where it is: if it’s in an arm or leg, symptoms include a lump or swelling in the limb – this is usually painless, but not always if it’s in the tummy (abdomen), symptoms include a painful, swollen tummy, and problems going to the toilet to poo (called constipation) if it’s in your bladder, symptoms include pain in the lower tummy, finding it difficult to pee (pass urine), and having blood in your pee if it’s in the chest, symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough and pain in your chest if it’s in the head or neck, symptoms include a lump, a blockage and discharge from the nose or throat; occasionally an eye may become swollen and stick out a bityou may also have other symptoms, such as tiredness, loss of appetite or weight loss.remember – most people with these symptoms won’t have a sarcoma.  but if you have any of these symptoms, or are worried that you may have a sarcoma, the first thing to do is to speak to your gp. they’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.it’s unknown what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults.people often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this.remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.this type of sarcoma grows in the active muscles of the body. these are muscles that we have control over, like the muscles we use to move our arms or legs. rhabdomyosarcomas are most likely to happen in the head, neck, bladder, vagina, arms, legs and trunk.there are different types or rhabdomyosarcoma. the most likely one to happen in teenagers and young adults is called an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and affects an arm or a leg.to find out more look at macmillan’srhabdomyosarcomainformation that is written for all ages.this type of sarcoma is most likely to happen in the tissue around the joints, like your elbow, knee and ankle. it can also happen in other parts of your body, but that is less common. this type of sarcoma might not be obvious straight away because the lump grows slowly and is usually not sore.if you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue ewing’s sarcoma, it’s treated in the same way as a ewing’s sarcoma in a bone. you can read more about this in macmillan’sbone cancersection.this type of sarcoma happens in the fibrous tissue in your body. fibrous tissue joins the structures inside your body together – like your muscles to bones. you’re most likely to find a fibrosarcoma on your arms, legs or trunk, but they can happen deeper in your body.if you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our generalsoft tissue sarcomainformation.the soft tissues of the body connect, surround and support other body tissue and organs. soft tissue includes muscle, cartilage, fat, fibrous tissue, nerves and blood vessels.soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body.there are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are: rhabdomyosarcomas synovial sarcomas fibrosarcomasthere are also bone sarcomas.doctors can tell the type of soft tissue sarcoma by closely examining the sample of tissue that’s been removed (called a biopsy) under a microscope.these develop from muscle and the surrounding tissue. there are 2 main types that affect younger people: alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas – these are more common in teenagers and young adults and are usually found in an arm or leg (limb), or in the muscles of the chest or tummy (abdomen) embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas – these are more common in children and can start in a number of areas, for example, around the eye, where the throat joins with the nose, the bladder, the womb, or the vaginathese usually develop near to but not inside joints, such as the knee or elbow. but they can develop anywhere in the body. they usually appear as hard lumps.these start in cells called fibrocytes, which form the tissue that helps join parts of our body together, such as joining the muscles to the bones. fibrosarcomas are usually found in the arms, legs or torso, but can also start in areas deeper in the body.the information in this section covers the common types of soft tissue sarcoma, but if you have a different one and want to know more, please contactmacmillan.it’s unknown what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults.remember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.some rare conditions that run in families (known as genetic conditions) can increase the chance (risk) of getting a soft tissue sarcoma. you would usually know if anyone in your family had one of these conditions.people who had radiotherapy for another type of cancer when they were a child may have an increased risk of developing a sarcoma in later life – this would be from their teens onwards.people often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this.if you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our generalsoft tissue sarcomainformation.there are some tests you might have at your gp surgery or at the hospital. these tests will help the doctors see whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma.if you think you might have some of the symptoms of a soft tissue sarcoma, you should go to your gp. they’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms, and they can arrange tests to find out more.they’ll examine you and usually arrange for some tests, such as x-rays. there may be a number of reasons why you’re feeling unwell, so it can be difficult to diagnose the problem straight away. if your gp can’t find the cause, you’ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.to begin with, you may see a specialist at a general hospital for more tests. if your gp suspects you have a soft tissue sarcoma, they may refer you directly to a sarcoma specialist.if you’re diagnosed with a sarcoma and you’re not already seeing a specialist, you’ll be referred to one. you’ll probably see a lot of doctors, nurses and other staff.your hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the following tests, which macmillan have information on: x-rays bone scans ultrasound scans mri,ctorpetscans biopsies bone marrow testsyou won’t necessarily need all of these tests.if the tests show that you have a sarcoma, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. macmillan have information on these, including: blood tests tests to check your heart is healthy, including anechocardiogramorelectrocardiogram (ecg),or a nuclear medicine scan (muga scan) tests to check your kidneys are healthy, which can involve blood tests or having your wee (urine) collected for a period of time or a nuclear medicine blood test (gfr)this may seem like a lot of tests, but they’ll help the doctors plan the best treatment for you.having tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends and your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier.if you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our generalsoft tissue sarcomainformation.this section is for teenagers and young adults. it’s about treatment for a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma. there are different types of soft tissue sarcoma, and the information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas and fibrosarcomas, which are the most common types in teenagers.if you have a different type and want to know more, pleasecontact macmillan.the 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.most people have a combination of treatments. your doctors will plan your treatment based on: the type of sarcoma you have the stage of the cancer (how big it is and whether it has spread from where it started) the grade of the cancer (how fast-growing the cancer cells are).if you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. they’ll be happy to help you understand what’s involved.if you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue ewing’s sarcoma, it’s treated in the same way as a ewing’s sarcoma in a bone.this is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. for soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy can be given in a number of situations: before surgery – to shrink the tumour after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, and to treat cancer cells that have spread when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operationfor soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a picc line. you can find out more aboutchemotherapyand how it’s given.you’ll have chemotherapy over a few days, then you’ll have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. the days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards are called a cycle. most people have several cycles of chemotherapy.you’ll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy, but it’s often possible to have part of your treatment as an outpatient.different chemotherapy drugs are used for soft tissue sarcomas, and you’ll usually have 2 or 3 drugs in combination. this is sometimes called a regimen or treatment plan. your doctor will decide which regimen or treatment plan is best for you depending on the grade and stage of your sarcoma. you may have chemotherapy treatment as part of a clinical research trial. it will be your decision whether or not you take part in a trial. your doctor will explain it fully before you make the choice if there is a trial that is right for you.some of the main chemotherapy drugs for soft tissue sarcomas are: ifosfamide vincristine actinomycin d doxorubicin cyclophosphamide cisplatinif you have a rhabdomyosarcoma, you may be given ifosfamide, vincristine and actinomycin. giving these drugs together is called iva.you might also be given ifosfamide, vincristine actinomycin and doxorubicin. giving these drugs together is called ivado.macmillan have more information aboutchemotherapy, including information aboutindividual drugsandcombinations of drugs, iva and ivado chemotherapy. this is written for anyone who’s looking for information about chemotherapy, not just for young adults.other types of soft tissue sarcoma can be treated with different combinations of drugs, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, or vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide. your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about the type of chemotherapy you’re going to have and how many cycles you’ll need.different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. some people have just a few side effects and others have more. it’s hard to know how it’s going to be for you, as everyone is different. the most common are hair loss, tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection.side effects can often be controlled, so always let your doctor or nurse know about the side effects you’re having. they can usually do something to improve them. most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.if you want to know more about the type of chemotherapy you’re having and its side effects, there’s lots more information in macmillan’schemotherapy section.surgery to remove the cancer is one of the main treatments for soft tissue sarcomas. your surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, and at the same time reduce any long-term effects as much as possible.the operation you have will depend on the size of the sarcoma and where it is in your body. you might meet other people with the same type of sarcoma who have had a different operation. everyone is different. your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand why you need to have it and what’s involved. below are some of the different types of operation you might have for a soft tissue sarcoma.we also have more information about what will happen before and after the operation in our surgery section.you may have an operation called a wide local excision to remove the cancer and an area of tissue surrounding it (called the margin). this tissue is checked to make sure it doesn’t contain any cancer cells. sometimes the surgeon also removes some of the lymph nodes (glands) near the cancer to find out if there are any cancer cells there. if there are cancer cells in the margin or lymph nodes, some people may need to have more surgery.if you need to have a large area of tissue removed, you may need to have a skin graft or soft tissue graft. this is when skin and sometimes muscle is taken from a different part of the body to place over the area where the sarcoma was removed from. this is called plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery. it’s done to give you as natural an appearance as possible and to make sure you can still do the things you did before your operation. both operation sites will gradually heal over a few weeks after the operation.if the sarcoma is in an arm or leg you may have limb-sparing surgery. this means the surgeon takes away the cancer without removing the arm or leg. you’ll have all of the tumour taken away from your limb, as well as any bone and muscle affected by the tumour.the surgeon then replaces what they’ve taken away. this may involve using plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery (see skin graft or soft tissue graft) to replace the tissue that’s been removed, or it may involve surgery to replace any bone that’s been removed. if you need to have bone removed, the surgeon replaces it with a specially designed metal implant called an endoprosthesis.if the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, your joint can be replaced with an artificial one.your physiotherapist might give you exercises before your operation to strengthen your muscles.if you’ve had chemotherapy, you’ll need 2 or 3 weeks to recover from the treatment before you can have your operation. doctors will check that your blood count has returned to normal. they’ll also make sure that you’re well enough to have the operation. if you’ve lost weight or been off your food, you might need to build yourself up a bit. the hospital dietitian can help you do this. you’ll probably also see a physiotherapist, who’ll give you exercises to do to strengthen your muscles.if you want to have a look at the endoprosthesis that will be put in during your surgery, your nurse or surgeon can usually arrange this.you’ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it still and let it heal.you’ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. this stops fluid building up in your wound. a nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days or when there isn’t very much fluid coming out of the wound.you won’t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you’ll be given fluids into a vein.you’ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help. it’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. the pain usually starts to get better within 2 to 3 days. as time goes on you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. be honest about how you are feeling to your doctors and nurses and they can make sure that you are comfortable and as pain-free as possible.once you’re home you’ll probably feel a bit better and stronger every day. but if you do have any problems it’s important to get them treated right away, as a delay could mean they get much more serious.if your new joint starts to stiffen up you may need some more physiotherapy, so tell your doctor so they can arrange this for you.if you notice any new redness, soreness or swelling in the limb that’s been operated on, it’s really important to get in touch with your doctor right away. you might have an infection that needs treatment, so you’ll need to see the surgeon who did your operation without delay.there’s more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section onliving with and after a soft tissue sarcoma.very occasionally the only way to get rid of the cancer is to remove the limb where the sarcoma is growing. this is called an amputation and it’s only ever done if there is no alternative.your doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what’s involved. losing a limb can feel very scary and you might want to talk to a specialist nurse or a counsellor about your feelings. it might also help to talk to someone who has had an amputation – your nurse or doctor can arrange this. it’s really important to get support.you’ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that’s been operated on. there’ll be a drain coming from the wound to remove any excess fluid that builds up. the drain is usually taken out by a nurse on the ward after 3 to 4 days or when there is no fluid coming from the wound. you’ll also be given fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again.you’ll probably feel a bit sore after your operation, especially for the first 2 to 4 days, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help with this. it’s important to tell the doctors and nurses if you need extra pain relief. you may have pain that feels as if it’s coming from the part of the limb that’s been removed. this is known as phantom pain. let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. there are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. it usually gets better and goes away in time.a physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. they’ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible.if you’ve had an arm removed, you’ll be able to get up and move around once you’ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don’t feel too sore. if you’ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. you’ll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days.once you’re up and around you’ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. this is a big part of your recovery. your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger.it’ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won’t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis (artificial limb) until this happens. in the meantime, you’ll be given a temporary prosthesis and you’ll start learning how to use it in physiotherapy. a specialist team will help you recover from the operation and get you used to the artificial limb that you’re fitted with.you’ll be able to go home about two weeks after your operation.you can read more about recovering after the operation in our information aboutliving with and after a soft tissue sarcoma.remember that it may be possible to talk to someone who has been through the same as you. your doctor or nurse can arrange this.radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy x-rays to destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. there’s more information about it in theradiotherapysection.for soft tissue sarcomas radiotherapy can be given in a number of situations: after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area, or to get rid of any cancer cells that may be left behind; you’ll usually have it about 4 to 6 weeks after the operation, when your wound has healed before surgery – to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with an operation when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operationradiotherapy is generally given every weekday (monday to friday). each treatment takes a few minutes.radiotherapy isn’t painful, but it can cause some side effects. after a few treatments you may begin to feel tired, and your skin may go red or get darker and feel sore or itchy around the area that’s being treated. this gets better once your radiotherapy treatment is over.other side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help.if you’re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our generalsoft tissue sarcomainformation.this information is about life after having surgery for a soft tissue sarcoma. you may find it useful to read the information about surgery first.the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. the best person to ask about your operation is your surgeon.after limb-sparing surgery the limb might not work as well as it used to. physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. you’ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. these can be hard work, but it’s important to keep going with them.if you’ve had a joint replacement, you’ll be able to walk and swim and do most of the things you could do before, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. these activities could damage or loosen the new joint. check with your surgeon about any special instructions they may have for what activities you can do.if you’ve had a shoulder replacement you might find it harder to lift your arm above your shoulder. after any kind of joint replacement, you will be given physiotherapy. it’s very important to do the exercises your physiotherapist shows you so that you get as much movement back as possible.after amputation most people have an artificial limb, called a prosthesis. there are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports.different types of prosthesis let you do different things. some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics.you might feel lots of different emotions. you might be tearful, angry, fed up or depressed at times. you might think you’ve lost all your confidence and that you’ll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. these feelings are normal, and it’s important that you get support to help you cope with them. you could talk to: family or friends a counsellor – this can be arranged by your doctor or nurse other young people in a similar situationthings will be tough as you get used to living with an amputation, but help is available.other people’s reactions can be hard to cope with, too. you might be worried about what your friends think or how they’re going to treat you. the thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful.try to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends you can call on when things get you down. you might also find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like a counsellor. most people find it helps to talk about how they’re feeling or what’s on their mind.if you’re

       " 'Spleen problems and spleen removal': 'some people are born without a spleen or need to have it removed because of disease or injury.the spleen is a fist-sized organ found in the upper left side of your abdomen, next to your stomach and behind your left ribs.it’s an important part of your immune system but you can survive without it. this is because the liver can take over many of the spleen’s functions.the spleen has a few important functions.it fights any invading germs in the blood (the spleen contains infection-fighting white blood cells).it controls the level of blood cells. the spleen controls the level of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets (small cells that form blood clots).it screens the blood and removes any old or damaged red blood cells.if the spleen doesn’t work properly, it may start to remove healthy blood cells. this can lead to:spleen pain is usually felt as a pain behind your left ribs. it may be tender when you touch the area. this can be a sign of a damaged, ruptured or enlarged spleen.the spleen can become damaged or may rupture (burst) after a forceful blow to the abdomen, car accident, sporting accident or fracture to the ribs.rupture can happen straight away or it may happen weeks after the injury.signs of a ruptured spleen are: pain behind your left ribs and tenderness when you touch this area dizziness and a rapid heart rate (a sign of low blood pressure caused by blood loss)sometimes, if you lie down and raise your legs, the pain can be felt at the tip of your left shoulder.a ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, as it can cause life-threatening bleeding. you think you’ve ruptured or damaged your spleenthe spleen can become swollen after an infection or injury. it can also become enlarged as a result of a disease such ascirrhosis, leukaemia orrheumatoid arthritis.an enlarged spleen doesn’t always cause symptoms. otherwise, look out for: feeling full very quickly after eating (an enlarged spleen can press on the stomach) feeling discomfort or pain behind your left ribs anaemiaand/or fatigue frequent infections easy bleedingdoctors can often tell if you have an enlarged spleen by feeling your abdomen. a blood test,ct scanormri scanwould confirm the diagnosis.the spleen is not usually removed if it’s just enlarged. instead, you’ll receive treatment for any underlying condition and your spleen will be monitored. antibiotics may be prescribed if there’s an infection.you’ll need to avoid contact sports for a while, as you’ll be at greater risk of rupturing the spleen while it is enlarged.surgery is only necessary if the enlarged spleen is causing serious complications or if the cause can’t be found.an operation to remove the spleen, known as a splenectomy, may be needed if the spleen is damaged, diseased or enlarged.it may sometimes be more appropriate to have just part of your spleen removed – a partial splenectomy.if there’s time, you’ll be advised to have a series of immunisations before the operation.most splenectomies are carried out using laparoscopy (keyhole surgery).a laparoscope is long, thin, flexible instrument with its own light source. it is attached to a camera and will relay high definition, magnified pictures back to a tv screen to guide the surgeon’s instruments.laparoscopic splenectomy allows a surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen without having to make large incisions (cuts) in your skin. however, you will still need a general anaesthetic.the procedure involves: making several incisions in your abdomen (tummy area) guiding a laparoscope into your body through one of the incisions, so doctors can see what they’re doing passing thin instruments into your abdomen through the other incisions, to remove your spleen – gas will be pumped into your abdomen to make this easierthe incisions will then be stitched up or sometimes glued together. you may be able to go home the same day, or may need to stay in hospital overnight. if you go home the same day, someone will need to stay with you for the first 24 hours.open surgery, where one large incision is made, may be needed if the spleen is too large or too damaged to be

cancer. more than 95% of stomach cancers develop in the cells of the stomach lining and are known as adenocarcinomas.less common types of stomach cancer include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue (tissue that drains away fluid and helps fight infection), and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (gists), which develop in the muscle or connective tissue of the stomach wall.many cases of stomach cancer can’t be completely cured, but it’s still possible to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life usingchemotherapyand in some casesradiotherapyand surgery.if operable, surgery can cure stomach cancer as long as all of the cancerous tissue can be removed.surgery to remove some or all of the stomach is known as a gastrectomy. it will still be possible to eat normally after a gastrectomy, but you’ll probably have to adjust the size of your portions.chemotherapy can also be used before surgery to help shrink the tumour and sometimes after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.read more abouttreating stomach cancerliving with stomach cancer and the effects of surgery can be tough, but there are a range of services that can provide social,

cause you to feel tired and breathless) yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)stomach cancer is usually easier to treat if it’s diagnosed early. it’s therefore important for your gp to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible if stomach cancer is suspected.stomach cancer is much more common in older people, with 90 out of 100 cases occurring in people who are over 55 years of age.indigestion is a very common symptom in the general population. however, it’s unlikely that someone with indigestion who’s under the age of 55 will have stomach cancer.however, see your gp if you have indigestion and weight loss, anaemia or persistent vomiting. they should refer you to a specialist for further testing.also see your gp if you have difficulty swallowing. this isn’t a common symptom among the general population and the cause should always be investigated.read more aboutdiagnosing stomach cancerstomach cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the stomach, although it’s unclear exactly why these changes occur.cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the dna in cells, which can affect how they grow. this means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system (a network of vessels and glands called lymph nodes located throughout the body).once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it’s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs.it’s not known what triggers the changes in dna that lead to stomach cancer and why only a small number of people develop the condition.however, evidence suggests that a number of different factors can affect your chances of developing stomach cancer.your risk of developing stomach cancer increases with age. most cases occur in people aged 55 or over.for reasons that are unclear, men are twice as likely as women to develop stomach cancer.people who smoke are about twice as likely to develop stomach cancer compared with non-smokers. this is because you swallow some cigarette smoke when you inhale and it ends up in your stomach. cigarettes contain harmful chemicals which can damage the cells in your stomach.the more you smoke and the longer you’ve been smoking, the bigger the risk. in the uk, around 1 in every 5 cases of stomach cancer (20%) is thought to be caused by smoking.helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a common type of bacteria. in most people, these bacteria are harmless, but in some people an h. pylori infection can cause problems such asstomach ulcers, recurring bouts ofindigestionor long-term inflammation of the stomach lining (chronic atrophic gastritis).research has found people with severe chronic atrophic gastritis have an increased risk of developing stomach cancer, although this risk is still small.a diet rich in pickled vegetables, such as pickled onions or piccalilli, salted fish, salt in general and smoked meats, such as pastrami or smoked beef, increases your risk of stomach cancer.countries where this type of diet is popular, such as japan, tend to have much higher rates of stomach cancer than the uk.a high fibre diet with 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day will help protect against stomach cancer, and a diet high in fats and processed food and red meat will increase your risk of getting stomach cancer.you’re more likely to develop stomach cancer if you have a close relative with the condition, such as one of your parents or a sibling (brother or sister). in such cases, it may be appropriate for your doctor to arrange genetic counselling.it’s not fully understood why stomach cancer seems to run in families. it may be because of shared risk factors, such as having similar diets or having an h. pylori infection, or because of certain genes you inherit from your parents.in around 1 in 50 cases of stomach cancer, testing has found that people share a mutation in a gene known as e-cadherin.you may be more at risk of getting the condition if you have the blood type a. your blood type is passed on from your parents, so this could be another way in which family history may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer.there’s also a condition that runs in families called familial adenomatous polyposis (fap), which may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer. fap causes small growths, called polyps, to form in your digestive system, and is known to increase your risk of developingbowel cancer.your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased if you’ve had another type of cancer, such ascancer of the oesophagusornon-hodgkin lymphoma(cancer that develops in your white blood cells).for men, the risk of getting stomach cancer is increased after havingprostate cancer,bladder cancer,breast cancerortesticular cancer. for women, the risk of developing stomach cancer increases after havingovarian cancer,breast cancerorcervical cancer.having certain medical conditions can also increase your risk of developing stomach cancer, such aspernicious anaemia(a vitamin b12 deficiency, which occurs when your body can’t absorb it properly), andpeptic stomach ulcers(an ulcer in your stomach lining, often caused by h. pylori infection).if you’ve had stomach surgery, or surgery to a part of your body that affects your stomach, you may be more likely to develop stomach cancer.this can include surgery to remove part of your stomach (known as a partial gastrectomy), surgery to remove part of your vagus nerve (the nerve that carries information from your brain to organs such as your heart, lungs and digestive system), or surgery to repair a stomach ulcer.there are 3 ways stomach cancer can spread: directly – the cancer can spread from the stomach into nearby tissues and organs, such as the pancreas, colon, small intestine and peritoneum (the lining of the inside of the abdominal cavity) through the lymphatic system – the lymphatic system is a series of glands (nodes) located throughout your body, similar to the blood circulatory system; the glands produce specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection through the blood – which can cause the cancer to spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, most commonly the liverstomach cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic stomach cancer.speak to your gp as soon as possible if you have stomach cancer symptoms such as indigestion, unexpected weight loss, anaemia and persistent vomiting.your gp will ask about your symptoms and examine your stomach for any lumpiness or tenderness. if they think that stomach cancer may be a possibility they’ll refer you to a specialist for further investigation.in 2015, thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs andsymptoms of stomach cancerand refer people for the

include ablood testand chestx-ray, which will assess your overall health. a sample of your stools may also be tested for blood.because of the potentially serious nature of stomach cancer, you should be referred to the specialist within 2 weeks. read more aboutwaiting times.an endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a piece of equipment called an endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and a video camera at the end).if you need to have an endoscopy, you won’t be able to eat or drink for four to eight hours before the procedure. this is to ensure your stomach and duodenum (top of the small intestine) are empty.you’ll be awake during the endoscopy, but may be given a sedative by injection to make you feel drowsy and relaxed. alocal anaestheticmay also be sprayed onto the back of your throat, so the area is numbed.the endoscope will be passed down your gullet (food pipe) and into your stomach so the specialist can look for anystomach ulcersor signs of cancer. if tissue is found that may be cancerous, a sample will be taken for testing. this procedure is known as abiopsy. the sample will be examined under a microscope in a laboratory. the results will show whether the cells are cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) and will usually take 7 to 10 days to come back.the endoscopy itself usually takes about 15 minutes, although you should allow about 2 hours in total for your visit.if your specialist thinks you may have cancer in the top part of your stomach, you may have anultrasound scanat the same time as an endoscopy. this is known as an endoscopic ultrasound and uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your stomach (this method is commonly used to view an unborn baby in the womb).if you have an endoscopic ultrasound, an ultrasound probe will be attached to the end of the endoscope before it’s passed down your throat. the scan will help determine the stage of any cancer in the top part of your stomach.after an endoscopy, or an endoscopic ultrasound, you won’t be able to drive for several hours because of the sedative. you may also have asore throat, although this should pass within a few days.a barium meal x-ray or barium swallow involves drinking a chalky liquid containing a substance called barium, which makes your stomach show up on an x-ray. nowadays, however, it’s less commonly used to diagnose stomach cancers.organs such as your stomach don’t usually show up on an x-ray because they’re made of soft tissue that isn’t dense enough to stop the x-rays passing through. however, when these organs are filled with barium, it blocks the x-rays and shows up white on an x-ray screen.you won’t able to eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the procedure because your stomach and duodenum need to be empty. you may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system.a barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes. afterwards, you’ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. you may feel slightly sick, and the barium may causeconstipation. your stools may be white for a few days afterwards as the barium passes through your system.if you’re diagnosed with stomach cancer, further tests may be needed to help determine how far it’s spread and how quickly it’s likely to spread (known as the stage and grade). your cancer specialist (oncologist) will discuss this with you.however, it may not always be possible to identify the exact stage of your condition until your treatment starts.your specialist may need to examine your stomach in more detail to see if the cancer has spread, particularly to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). if it has, you may need to have a small operation called a laparoscopy. this procedure is carried out under ageneral anaesthetic, so you’ll be unconscious during it.during the procedure, a thin viewing tube with a camera at the end (a laparoscope) will be inserted into your stomach through a small incision in the lower part of your tummy. in some cases, your specialist may need to examine more than one area of your stomach and make more than one incision.duringct scansorpet scans, a series of x-ray images of your body are taken. a computer is then used to put the images together and create a detailed picture of the inside of your body.these scans will help your doctor assess how advanced your cancer is. it allows them to see whether the cancerous cells have formed tumours anywhere else in the body. the scans can also help your doctors work out which type of treatment will be most effective and appropriate for you.if your specialist thinks your stomach cancer may have spread to your liver, you may need to have a liverultrasound. this type of scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your liver.after all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell what stage and grade of stomach cancer you have.staging is a measurement of how far cancer has spread. there are a number of different ways stomach cancer can be staged. one method uses a numbering system from 1 to 4. the higher the number, the further the cancer has spread.the majority of stomach cancers are at stage 3 or 4 when diagnosed, which means a cure isn’t usually possible.grading describes how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. there are 3 grades of stomach cancer: low-grade – the cancer tends to grow slowly medium-grade – the cancer grows a bit faster high-grade – the cancer is aggressive and likely to grow quicklycancer research uk has more information about the staging and grading of stomach cancer.the treatments recommended for stomach cancer will depend on your general health and how far the cancer has spread.most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams made up of a number of different specialists (see below) who work together to plan and carry out the best treatment, tailored to your circumstances.feel free to discuss treatment with your care team at any time and ask questions.the main treatments for stomach cancer are surgery,chemotherapyandradiotherapy. you may have 1 of these treatments or a combination.if surgery is recommended, you may have chemotherapy beforehand. if the tumour is in the upper part of your stomach, including the junction between the oesophagus and stomach, you may also have radiotherapy prior to surgery.surgery is mainly used if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy tend to be used when the condition is diagnosed at a later stage.where possible, the primary aim of treatment is to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body. it’s estimated that a cure is possible in 20 to 30% of stomach cancer cases.if it’s not possible to remove the tumour, your doctors will focus on trying to prevent it from getting any bigger and causing further harm to your body. this may be done using surgery or chemotherapy.in some cases, it’s not possible to eliminate the cancer or slow it down. in this case, your treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible, usually with surgery or radiotherapy.a relatively new medication called trastuzumab (see below) can also be used to treat some types of advanced stomach cancer.your healthcare team will talk to you about which treatments are most suitable.if you’re diagnosed with stomach cancer at an early stage, it may be possible for the cancer to be completely removed during surgery.in some cases, it may be possible to pass a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your oesophagus (gullet), rather than making incisions in your tummy. this is known as endoscopic surgery, and can be used to remove a sample of the tumour for testing (biopsy). it can also be used to remove the tumour completely if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage.however, if your cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it completely. if this is the case, you may still have surgery to remove any cancer blocking your stomach, to ease your symptoms. this will depend on whether your symptoms can be controlled and the risks and side effects of undertaking major surgery.any type of surgery for stomach cancer will involve a large operation and a long recovery time. if you have stomach cancer surgery, you’ll usually need to stay in hospital for around 2 weeks. you’ll also need several weeks at home to recover.you may need to have part or all of your stomach removed.surgery to remove part of your stomach is known as a partial or sub-total gastrectomy, and surgery to remove all of your stomach is known as a total gastrectomy. in some cases, your surgeon may remove part of your oesophagus as well as all of your stomach, using a procedure known as an oesophagogastrectomy.these operations may be carried out using either a large incision in your tummy (open surgery), or a number of smaller incisions through which surgical tools can be passed (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery). both of these techniques are carried out undergeneral anaesthetic, which means you’ll be unconscious throughout the procedure.during these operations, your surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) nearest to the cancer. it’s possible that your stomach cancer may have spread to these lymph nodes, and removing them helps prevent the cancer returning.if your cancer is in the lower part of your stomach, you may have a partial gastrectomy to remove it.after surgery, your stomach will be smaller than it was before the operation. however, the top part of your stomach, where your oesophagus feeds into it, won’t be affected.if your cancer is in the middle or at the top of your stomach, you may need to have a total gastrectomy. if the cancer is close to the end of your oesophagus, where it meets your stomach, you may need to have an oesophagogastrectomy.if you have a total gastrectomy, the end of your gullet will be joined to the top of your jejunum (the top part of your small intestine). if you have an oesophagogastrectomy, the remaining part of your gullet will be joined to your jejunum.if your stomach cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it using surgery.however, if your stomach has been significantly affected by cancer it can cause a blockage, which prevents food from being properly digested. a blocked stomach can cause symptoms such as stomach pain, vomiting and feeling very full after eating.if your stomach is blocked, there are a few options: stenting – a stent is a plastic or wire mesh tube inserted through the oesophagus using an endoscope underlocal anaesthetic; after being inserted, the stent will be expanded and open up the stomach partial or total gastrectomy – to remove the blockage and improve your symptoms bypass surgery – an operation where part of your stomach above the blockage is joined to your small intestine, leaving the blocked part of your stomach out of your digestive systemchemotherapy is a specialist treatment for cancer that uses medicines, called cytotoxic medicines, to stop cancer cells dividing and multiplying. as it circulates through your body, the medicine can target cancer cells in your stomach and any that may have spread to other parts of your body.you may have chemotherapy for stomach cancer before surgery to reduce the amount of cancer that has to be removed during the operation. chemotherapy can also be used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back.chemotherapy can also help to slow the progression of cancer and ease the symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer, which may not be suitable for surgery.if may be given orally (as tablets) or intravenously (by injection or a drip through a vein directly into your bloodstream), or a combination of both.intravenous chemotherapy is usually given in hospital, while oral chemotherapy is taken at home. chemotherapy is often given in cycles, each usually lasting about three weeks.alternatively, chemotherapy may be administered through a small pump, which gives you a constant low dose over a few weeks or months. the pumps are portable and can be worn at home, which means fewer trips to hospital.chemotherapy works by preventing cancerous cells from growing rapidly. however, it also destroys non-cancerous cells such as hair follicles and red and white blood cells. side effects may include: tiredness nausea and vomiting nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy) hair loss diarrhoea anaemia(a lack of red blood cells) weight loss skin changes – such as redness, swelling and a tingling sensation in the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feetthe side effects you experience after having chemotherapy will depend on the type of chemotherapy and the number of treatment sessions you need. you’ll be told who to contact if you’re experiencing serious side effects from chemotherapy, and it’s very important that this contact information is recorded carefully.if you experience nausea and vomiting as a result of chemotherapy, you may be able to take anti-sickness medication to counter it. this may be given intravenously (by injection directly into your bloodstream) at the same time as your chemotherapy.the side effects of chemotherapy will only last for as long as your course of treatment lasts. once your treatment is over, the hair follicles and blood cells will repair themselves. this means your hair will grow back, although it might look or feel different from how it did before chemotherapy (for example, it may be a slightly different colour, or be softer or curlier than before).radiotherapy uses beams of high energyradiationto destroy cancer cells. it’s not often used to treat stomach cancer because there’s a risk that other organs close to your stomach might be damaged by the treatment.however, if you have advanced stomach cancer that’s causing pain or bleeding, you may need to have radiotherapy. in some cases, following surgery, you may have chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to help prevent the stomach cancer from recurring.if a cancer is bleeding slowly and causinganaemia, a single fraction of radiotherapy can be used to try to prevent further bleeding.if you need radiotherapy, your treatment will usually begin 2 or 3 months after surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. this is a painless procedure where you lie under a radiotherapy machine while it directs radiation at your stomach. you’ll be positioned by a radiographer (a specialist in radiotherapy) so that the machine targets the cancer cells and avoids as much healthy tissue as possible.radiotherapy often involves having treatment sessions 5 days a week. each session will only last a few minutes. the radiation doesn’t stay in your system afterwards, and it’s perfectly safe to be around others between your treatments.how long you’ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on how it’s used. radiotherapy used after surgery to help prevent stomach cancer coming back usually lasts 5 weeks. if it’s being used to control symptoms of advanced stomach cancer, it may only last 1 or 2 weeks.you may experience the following side effects after having radiotherapy: tiredness nausea diarrhoea irritation and darkening of your skin where the treatment takes placethese side effects will usually improve within a few weeks of treatment finishing.trastuzumab (sold under the brand name herceptin) is a medication used to treatbreast cancerand some cases of advanced stomach cancer.some stomach cancers are stimulated by a type of protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2). trastuzumab works by blocking the effects of this protein. this doesn’t cure stomach cancer, but it can slow its growth and increase survival time.if you’re diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and tests show high levels of the her2 protein in the cancerous cells, your doctors may recommend treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab.trastuzumab is given intravenously, through a drip, and you’ll have the treatment in hospital. each treatment session takes up to 1 hour and you’ll usually need a session once every 3 weeks.trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. therefore, it may not be suitable if you have a heart problem such asangina, uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart valve disease. if you need to take trastuzumab, you’ll also need regular tests on your heart to check for any problems.other side effects of trastuzumab may include: an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever diarrhoea tiredness aches and painsbeing diagnosed with cancer is a tough challenge for most people, but support is available to help you cope.you may find the following advice helpful: keep talking to your friends and family – they can be a powerful support system talk to others in the same situation research your condition set reasonable goals take time out for yourselfcancer charities, such asmacmillan cancer support, are a good source of information and support.getting back to normal after surgery can take time. it’s important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover. during your recovery, avoid lifting heavy things such as children or shopping bags, and strenuous tasks such as housework. you may also be advised not to drive.some other treatments, particularlychemotherapyandradiotherapy, can make you very tired. you may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends.after your treatment has finished, you’ll be invited for regular check-ups, usually every three months for the first year. during the check-up, your doctor will examine you and may arrangeblood testsor scans to see how you’re responding to treatment.if you’ve had an operation to remove part of your stomach (partial gastrectomy), you’ll only be able to eat small amounts of food for a while after your operation. this is because your stomach won’t be able to hold as much food as it could before the surgery, and your body will need to adjust to its new stomach capacity. you should gradually be able to increase the amount you eat as your stomach begins to expand.if you’ve had surgery to remove all of your stomach (total gastrectomy), it may be some time before you can eat normally again. as with a partial gastrectomy, you’ll only be able to eat small amounts of food until your body adjusts. you may have to eat little and often, and make changes to the types of food you eat. your care team will be able to advise you about what and when you should eat.having surgery to remove your stomach also means you’ll need to have regular injections of vitamin b12. vitamin b12 is usually absorbed through your stomach from the food you eat and is needed to help prevent a condition calledanaemiaand nerve problems.eat regularly and healthily. you may not have time to sit down for every meal, but you should make time to do so at least once a day.it’s understandable if there are times when you feel resentful, and then guilty for feeling so. you may also feel exhausted, isolated and worry about the person you care for. remember: you’re human, and those feelings are natural.if your stomach cancer can’t be cured, your gp will give you support and any necessary pain relief (often alongside chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which can be used to reduce your symptoms). this is calledpalliative care. support is also available for your family and friends. cancer research uk: stomach cancer macmillan cancer support: stomach cancer',\n",
       " 'Stomach ulcer': 'stomach ulcers (gastric ulcers) are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach. ulcers can also occur in part of the intestine just beyond the stomach. these are called duodenal ulcers.stomach and duodenal ulcers are sometimes called peptic ulcers. this information applies to both.although the most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the abdomen (tummy). not all stomach ulcers are painful.some people experience: indigestion heartburn nausea (feeling sick)you should speak to your gp if you think you have a stomach ulcer.more about thesymptoms of a stomach ulcerspeak to your gp immediately (or phone 111) if: your symptoms persist you’re vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds you’re passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools you feel a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worsethese could be a sign of a serious complication.stomach ulcers occur when the layer protecting the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down. this allows the stomach lining to become damaged.this is usually caused by: an infection with helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) bacteria taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such as ibuprofen or aspirin – particularly if they’re taken for a long time or at high dosesthere’s little evidence that stress or certain foods causes stomach ulcers.more about thecauses of stomach ulcersyou’ll be treated using antibiotics if your ulcer was caused by a h. pylori infection. this kills the bacteria and should prevent the ulcer coming back.you’ll be treated using a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) if your ulcer was caused by nsaids. your doctor will prescribe these and discuss whether you should keep using nsaids. alternative medication to nsaids, such asparacetamol, may be recommended.most stomach ulcers take a few months to heal after treatment. however, stomach ulcers can come back after treatment, although this is less likely to happen if the underlying cause is addressed.more abouttreating stomach ulcerscomplications are rare but can be very serious and potentially life-threatening.the main complications include: bleeding at the site of the ulcer the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splits open – known as perforation the ulcer blocks the movement of food through the digestive system – known as gastric obstructionmore about thecomplications of stomach ulcersthe most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain that develops in your abdomen (tummy).however, some stomach ulcers aren’t painful and are only noticed when a complication develops, such as bleeding from the ulcer.the pain caused by a stomach ulcer can either travel: out from the middle of your tummy up to your neck down to your belly button through to your backand: can last from a few minutes to a few hours often starts within a few hours of eating can cause you to wake up during the nighttaking antacids (indigestion medication) may temporarily relieve the pain, but it will keep coming back if the ulcer isn’t treated.less common symptoms of a stomach ulcer include: indigestion heartburn loss of appetite feeling and being sick weight losssome people also find they burp or become bloated after eating fatty foods.stomach ulcers are usually caused by helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) bacteria or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids).these can break down the stomach’s defence against the acid it produces to digest food. the stomach lining then becomes damaged causing an ulcer to form.h. pylori bacteria live in the stomach lining. the bacteria can irritate the stomach lining and make it more vulnerable to damage from stomach acid.infections are common. it’s possible to be infected without realising it because the infection doesn’t usually cause symptoms.people of all ages can be infected. it’s not clear exactly why some people are more vulnerable to the effects of h. pylori bacteria than others.nsaids are medicines widely used to treat pain, a high temperature (fever) and inflammation (swelling).commonly used nsaids include: ibuprofen aspirin naproxen diclofenacmany people take nsaids without having any side effects. but there’s always a risk the medication could cause problems, such as stomach ulcers, particularly if taken for a long time or at high doses.you may be advised not to use nsaids if you currently have a stomach ulcer or if you’ve had one in the past.paracetamolis a safer painkiller to use.more aboutnsaidsthere’s little evidence that stomach ulcers are caused by: spicy foods stress alcoholbut these can make the symptoms worse.however, smoking can: increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers make treatment less effectiveif your gp thinks you have an ulcer, they will want to know if you’re taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) might test you for an helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infectionin some cases, you may be referred for a gastroscopy to look for an ulcer inside your stomach.if your gp thinks your symptoms might be caused by an h. pylori infection, you’ll be offered a: urea breath test stool antigen test – a small stool sample is tested for the bacteria blood testyou’ll be given a special drink containing a chemical that’s broken down by h. pylori. your breath is then analysed to see whether or not you have an h. pylori infection.a sample of your blood’s tested for antibodies to the h. pylori bacteria. antibodies are proteins produced naturally in your blood to help fight infection.this test’s now largely been replaced by the stool antigen testmore aboutblood testsa gastroscopy is a procedure that involves passing a thin, flexible tube (an endoscope) with a camera at one end into your mouth and down into your stomach and first section of the small intestine (duodenum).you may: be given a mild sedative injection before the procedure have your throat sprayed with alocal anaestheticto make it more comfortable to pass the endoscopethe images taken by the camera will usually confirm or rule out an ulcer. a small tissue sample may also be taken from your stomach or duodenum to test for the h. pylori bacteria.you’ll have this procedure as an outpatient in hospital. this means you won’t have to spend the night.you may have a repeat gastroscopy after 4 to 6 weeks to check that the ulcer’s healed.if you have a stomach ulcer, your treatment will depend on what caused it.with treatment, most ulcers heal in a month or two.if your stomach ulcer’s caused by a helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) bacterial infection, you’ll be given: a course ofantibiotics a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (ppi)this is also recommended if it’s thought your stomach ulcer’s caused by a combination of an h. pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids).if you have an h. pylori infection, you’ll usually be prescribed a course of 2 or 3 antibiotics.the most commonly used antibiotics are: amoxicillin clarithromycin metronidazoleyou should take these twice a day for a week.the side effects of these are usually mild, but can include: feeling and being sick diarrhoea a metallic taste in your mouthyou’ll be re-tested at least 4 weeks after finishing your antibiotic course to see if there are any h. pylori bacteria left in your stomach. if there are, a further course of eradication therapy using different antibiotics may be given.if your stomach ulcer’s caused by taking nsaids: you’ll be given a course of ppi medication your use of nsaids will be reviewed, and you may be advised to use an alternative painkilleryou may be advised to use an alternative painkiller not associated with stomach ulcers, such asparacetamol.cox-2 inhibitors are sometimes recommended. these are an alternative type of nsaid that’s less likely to cause stomach ulcers.if you’re taking low-doseaspirinto reduce your risk of blood clots, your gp will tell you whether you need to keep taking it.if you do, you may also be prescribed long-term treatment with a ppi or h2-receptor antagonist to prevent further ulcers.it’s important to understand the potential risks associated with continued nsaid use.you’re more likely to develop another stomach ulcer and could experience a serious complication, such as internal bleeding.read more about thecomplications of stomach ulcersppis work by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. this prevents further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally.the most commonly used ppis are: omeprazole pantoprazole lansoprazolethey’re usually prescribed for 4 to 8 weeks.side effects of these are usually mild, but can include: headaches diarrhoea orconstipation feeling sick abdominal (tummy) pain dizziness rashesthese should pass once treatment has been completed.sometimes a type of medication called h2-receptor antagonists are used instead of ppis.these also reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces.ranitidine is the most widely used h2-receptor antagonist for treating stomach ulcers.side effects are uncommon, but can include: diarrhoea headaches dizziness rashes tirednessas these treatments can take several hours before they start to work, your gp may recommend taking additional antacid medication.antacids: neutralise your stomach acid provide immediate, but short-term, symptom relief should be taken when you experience symptoms or when you expect them, such as after meals or at bedtimesome antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate, which produces a protective coating on the lining of your stomach. antacids containing alginates are best taken after meals.you can buy these medications at pharmacies. your pharmacist can tell you which is most suitable for you.side effects of both medications are usually mild, but can include: diarrhoea or constipation farting stomach cramps feeling and being sickthere aren’t any special lifestyle measures you need to take during treatment.however, avoiding stress, alcohol, spicy foods and smoking may reduce your symptoms while your ulcer heals.complications of stomach ulcers are rare, but can be very serious.the main complications are: internal bleeding perforation – the lining of the stomach splits open gastric outlet obstruction – the stomach ulcer obstructs the normal passage of food through your digestive systeminternal bleeding’s the most common complication of stomach ulcers. it can occur when an ulcer develops at the site of a blood vessel.the bleeding can either be slow and long-term, or rapid and severe.slow, long-term bleeding can lead to anaemia.symptoms of anaemia include: fatigue breathlessness pale skin heart palpitations (noticeable heartbeats)you should visit your gp if you have persistent symptoms of anaemia. if they think you have a stomach ulcer, they may refer you to a gastroenterologist for an examination and

endoscopy to stop the bleeding.sometimes: specialised procedures carried out underx-rayguidance are used to stop bleeding ulcers surgery is needed to repair the affected blood vesselblood transfusionsmay also be needed to replace the blood you’ve lost.perforations are a rarer complication of stomach ulcers. this is when the lining of the stomach splits open.this can be very serious because it lets the bacteria that live in your stomach escape and infect the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum). this is known as peritonitis.in peritonitis, an infection can rapidly spread into the blood (sepsis) before spreading to other organs. this carries the risk of multiple organ failure and can be fatal if left untreated.the most common symptom of peritonitis is sudden abdominal pain, which gets steadily worse. if you have this type of pain, contact your gp or the nhs 24 111 service immediately.peritonitis is a medical emergency that requires hospital admission. in some cases, surgery may be needed.in some cases, an inflamed (swollen) or scarred stomach ulcer can obstruct the normal passage of food through your digestive system. this is called a gastric outlet obstruction.symptoms include: vomiting large amounts of undigested food a constant feeling of bloating or fullness feeling more full than usual after eating less food unexplained weight lossan endoscopy can be used to confirm the obstruction.if the obstruction’s caused by inflammation, proton pump inhibitors (ppis) or h2-receptor antagonists can be used to reduce stomach acid levels until the swelling goes down.if the obstruction’s caused by scar tissue, surgery may be needed. this can involve passing a small balloon through an endoscope and inflating it to widen the site of the

of developing serious health problems, such as skin cancer, in later life.it’s easy to underestimate your exposure to the sun when outside, as the redness doesn’t usually develop for several hours.

recommend using hydrocortisone cream for a few days (this is also available over the counter at pharmacies) to reduce the inflammation of your skin.severe sunburn may require special burn cream and burn dressings from your gp or a nurse at your gp practice. very occasionally, hospital treatment may be needed.everyone who is exposed to uv light is at risk of getting sunburn, although some people are more vulnerable than others.you should take extra care when out in the sun if you: have pale, white or light brown skin have freckles or red or fair hair tend to burn rather than tan have many moles have skin problems relating to a medical condition are only exposed to intense sun occasionally – for example, while on holiday are in a hot country where the sun is particularly intense have a family history of skin cancerpeople who spend a lot of time in the sun, whether it’s for work or play, are at increased risk of skin cancer if they don’t take the right precautions.snow, sand, concrete and water can reflect the sun’s rays onto your skin, and the sun is more intense at high altitudes.the short-term risks of sun exposure are sunburn and sunallergy.the longer-term risks (over decades) include: actinic (solar) keratoses – rough and scaly pre-cancerous spots on the skin skin cancer – including bothmelanomaandnon-melanoma skin cancer eye problems – such as photokeratitis (snow blindness) and cataracts premature ageing of the skin and wrinklingskin should be protected from strong sunlight by covering up with suitable clothing, seeking shade and applying sunscreen.in the uk, the risk of getting sunburnt is highest from march to october, particularly from 11am to 3pm, when the sun’s rays are strongest.there is also a risk of getting sunburn in other weather conditions. for example, light reflecting off snow can also cause sunburn. you can also burn in cloudy and cool conditions.suitable clothing includes: a wide-brimmed hat that shades the face, neck and ears a long-sleeved top trousers or long skirts in close-weave fabrics that do not allow sunlight through sunglasses with wraparound lenses or wide arms with the ce mark and european standard en

circle logo and at least 4-star uva protection at least spf30 sunscreen to protect against uvbmost people do not apply enough sunscreen. the amount of sunscreen needed for the body of an average adult to achieve the stated sun protection factor (spf) is around 35ml or 6 to 8 teaspoons of lotion.if sunscreen is applied too thinly, it provides less protection. if you’re worried you might not be applying enough spf30, you could use a stronger spf50 sunscreen.if you plan to be out in the sun long enough to risk burning, sunscreen needs to be applied twice: 30 minutes before going out just before you go outsunscreen should be applied to all exposed skin, including the face, neck and ears (and head if you have thinning or no hair), but a wide-brimmed hat is better.how long it takes for your skin to go red or burn varies from person to person. the cancer research uk website has a handy tool where you canfind out your skin type, to see when you might be at risk of burning.water-resistant sunscreen is needed if sweating or contact with water is likely.sunscreen needs to be reapplied liberally, frequently and according to the manufacturer’s instructions. this includes straight after you’ve been in water (even if it is ‘water-resistant’) and after towel drying, sweating or when it may have rubbed off.children aged under 6 months should be kept out of direct strong sunlight.from march to october in the uk, children should: cover up with suitable clothing spend time in the shade (particularly from 11am to 3pm) wear at least spf30 sunscreento ensure they get enough vitamin d, children aged under 5 are advised to take vitamin d supplements even if they do get out in the sun.',\n",

       " 'Swollen glands': 'swollen lymph glands are usually a sign of infection. swollen lymph glands that are caused by an infection usually get better by themselves in 1 to 2 weeks.sometimes swollen lymph glands can have a more serious cause and may need to be seen by a doctor.you have swollen glands and you:you have swollen glands and: they’re getting bigger they’ve not gone down within 1 week they feel hard or do not move when you press them you’re having night sweats or have a very high temperature (you feel hot and shivery) you have no other signs of illness or infection you have swollen lymph glands just above or below your collar bone (the bone that runs from your breastbone to each of your shoulders)the lymph glands (or lymph nodes) are small lumps of tissue that contain white blood cells. these help to fight bacteria, viruses and anything else that causes infection. they’re an important part of the immune system and are found throughout the body.the lymph glands can swell to more than a few centimetres in response to infection or disease.swollen glands feel like tender, painful lumps. you may feel them: on each side of the neck under the chin in the armpits around the groinswollen glands are usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection like: a cold tonsillitis glandular fever a throat infection an ear infection a dental abscess cellulitis (a skin infection)the glands in the affected area will often become suddenly tender or painful. you may also have other symptoms like a sore throat, cough, or fever.these infections usually clear up on their own and the swollen glands will soon go down.swollen lymph glands are rarely caused by anything more serious.when an infection causes swollen glands you can help to ease symptoms at home. drink plenty of fluids rest use over-the-counter medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen',\n",
       " 'Syphilis': 'british sign language (bsl)|简体中文|polski|română|slovenčinasyphilis is a bacterial infection. it’s hard to detect and is one of the most easily caught sexually transmitted infections (stis).most people with syphilis don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. symptoms change over time and may come and go.syphilis usually has 3 stages.ten days to 3 months after infection, you may notice a small, painless sore or ulcer.this is typically on either the:you might only have 1 sore, but can have more.swelling in your lymph glands (such as in the neck, groin or armpit) often happens with the ulcers.the sore will then disappear within 2 to 6 weeks. if left untreated, syphilis will move into its second stage.symptoms of secondary syphilis begin a few weeks after the original sore disappears.common symptoms of secondary syphilis include: a non-itchy skin rash appearing anywhere on the body, but commonly on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet tiredness headaches swollen lymph glandsless common symptoms include: fever weight loss patchy hair loss joint painsthese symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, or come and go for a few months.syphilis will then move into a stage where you will experience no symptoms. you’re still infected during this stage. this is called ‘latent syphilis’. you can still pass it on during the first year of this stage. after a couple of years, you can’t pass the infection to others, even though you remain infected. however, during this stage, the infection can be passed on from a mother to an unborn child during pregnancy.the latent stage can continue for many years (even decades) after you first become infected. without treatment, there is a risk that latent syphilis will move on to the more serious stage –tertiary syphilis.the symptoms of tertiary syphilis can begin years or even decades after the initial infection. 1 in 3 people who are not treated for syphilis develop serious symptoms eventually.the symptoms of tertiary syphilis will depend on what part of the body the infection spreads to. for example, it may affect the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, bones, skin or blood vessels, potentially causing any of the following symptoms: stroke dementia loss of co-ordination numbness paralysis blindness deafness heart disease skin rashesat this stage, syphilis can be dangerous enough to cause death.if you think you might have syphilis, get tested for free by: booking an appointment at your local sexual health service contacting your gp practice for an appointmentthe only reliable way to tell if you have syphilis or not is to have a blood test. this is usually sent to the lab for analysis. however, in some sexual health services, a same day test can be done if you have symptoms.antibiotics will treat the syphilis infection, even during pregnancy. these are given by injection, tablets or capsules.treatment may be started before your test result is known. you may be given one or more doses, depending on the stage of infection.you’ll need to go back to your gp practice or sexual health clinic 6 and 12 weeks after starting treatment to be retested.you should avoid having sex until you and your partner (s) have finished treatment and your tests have shown treatment has worked. this includes oral sex and sex using a condom.your partner should also get tested for syphilis. it can be hard to spot in its early stages and they might not realise they have it. they will generally be offered treatment regardless.in scotland, pregnant women are tested for syphilis as part of theirantenatal checks.if you’re pregnant and have syphilis, you can pass it on to your baby before they’re born. this is known as congenital syphilis.having syphilis during pregnancy can increase the risk of: miscarriage premature birth stillbirthyou can get syphilis by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). around one third of all people who get syphilis do so through having unprotected oral sex with no other vaginal or anal sex involved. it can also be passed by coming into contact with an ulcer on your partners penis, vagina, anus or inside their mouth.syphilis can be passed on: to an unborn baby during pregnancy (congenital syphilis) by injecting drugs with a needle that’s been used by someone who has syphilis during a

       " 'Testicular cancer': 'cancer of the testicle is one of the less common cancers. it tends to mostly affect men and anyone with testicles between 15 and 49 years of age.the most common symptom is a painlesslump or swelling in one of the testicles. it can be the size of a pea or it may be much larger.other symptoms can include: a dull ache in the scrotum a feeling of heaviness in the scrotumit’s important to be aware of what feels normal for you. get to know your body and speak to your gp if you notice any changes.read more about thesymptoms of testicular canceranddiagnosing testicular cancer.the testicles are the 2 oval-shaped male sex organs that sit inside the scrotum on either side of the penis.the testicles are an important part of the male reproductive system because they produce sperm and the hormone testosterone, which plays a major role in male sexual development.the different types of testicular cancer are classified by the type of cells thecancerbegins in.the most common type of testicular cancer is ‘germ cell testicular cancer’, which accounts for around 95% of all cases. germ cells are a type of cell that the body uses to create sperm.there are 2 main subtypes of germ cell testicular cancer. they are: seminomas – which have become more common in the last 20 years and now account for 50 to 55% of testicular cancers non-seminomas – which account for most of the rest and include teratomas, embryonal carcinomas, choriocarcinomas and yolk sac tumoursboth types tend to respond well tochemotherapy.less common types of testicular cancer include: leydig cell tumours – which account for around 1 to 3% of cases sertoli cell tumours – which account for around 1% of cases lymphoma – which accounts for around 4% of casesthis topic focuses on germ cell testicular cancer. you can contact the cancer support specialists atmacmillanfor more information about leydig cell tumour and sertoli cell tumours. their helpline number is 0808 808 00 00 and it’s open monday to friday, 9am to 8pm.read more abouthodgkin lymphomaandnon-hodgkin lymphoma.testicular cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer.testicular cancer is unusual compared to other cancers because it tends to affect younger men and anyone with testicles. although it’s relatively uncommon overall, testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect men and anyone with testicles between the ages of 15 and 49.for reasons that are unclear, white men and anyone with testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer compared with other ethnic groups.the number of cases of testicular cancer that are diagnosed each year in the uk has roughly doubled since the mid-1970s. again, the reasons for this are unclear.the exact cause or causes of testicular cancer are unknown, but a number of factors have been identified that increase a man’s risk of developing it. the 3 main risk factors are described below.undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) is the most significant risk factor for testicular cancer.about 3 to 5% of boys are born with their testicles inside their abdomen. they usually descend into the scrotum during the first year of life, but in some boys the testicles don’t descend.in most cases, testicles that don’t descend by the time a boy is 1 year old descend at a later stage. if the testicles don’t descend naturally, an operation known as an orchidopexy can be carried out to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum.it’s important that undescended testicles move down into the scrotum during early childhood because boys with undescended testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer than boys whose testicles descend normally. it’s also much easier to observe the testicles when they’re in the scrotum.people with undescended testicles are about 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer than those whose testicles descend at birth or shortly after.having a close relative with a history of testicular cancer or an undescended testicle increases your risk of also developing it.for example, if your father had testicular cancer, you’re around 4 times more likely to develop it than someone with no family history of the condition. if your brother had testicular cancer, you’re about 8 times more likely to develop it.a number of genes may be involved in the development of testicular cancer in families where more than 1 person has had the condition. this is an ongoing area of research in which patients and their families may be asked to take part.people who’ve previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are between 4 to 12 times more likely to develop it in the other testicle.for this reason, if you’ve previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer, it’s very important that you keep a close eye on the other testicle.if you’ve been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you also need to be observed for signs of recurrence for between 5 and 10 years, so it’s very important that you attend your follow-up appointments.cancer research uk has more information abouttesticular cancer risks and causes.testicular cancer is one of the most treatable types of cancer, and the outlook is one of the best for cancers.almost all men and anyone with testicles who are treated for testicular germ cell tumours are cured, and it’s rare for the condition to return more than 5 years later.treatment almost always includes the surgical removal of the affected testicle – called orchidectomy or orchiectomy – which doesn’t usually affect fertility or the ability to have sex.in some cases,chemotherapyor, less commonly,radiotherapymay be used for seminomas (but not non-seminomas).read more abouttreating testicular cancer.the most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in 1 of your testicles.the lump or swelling can be about the size of a pea, but may be larger.most lumps or swellings in the scrotum aren’t in the testicle and aren’t a sign of cancer. but they should never be ignored. visit your gp as soon as you notice a lump or swelling in your scrotum.testicular cancer can also cause other symptoms, including a: dull ache or sharp pain in your testicles or scrotum, which may come and go feeling of heaviness in your scrotum change in the texture or increase in firmness of a testicle difference between one testicle and the otherspeak to your gp as soon as you notice any lump or swelling on your testicle. they’ll examine your testicles to help determine whether or not the lump is cancerous.lumps within the scrotum can have many different causes and testicular cancer is rare. if your gp thinks the lump is in your testicle they may consider cancer as a possible cause.research has shown that less than 4% of scrotal lumps or swellings are cancerous. for example, varicoceles (swollen blood vessels) and epididymal cysts (cysts in the tubes around the testicle) are common causes of testicular lumps.if you do have testicular cancer, the sooner treatment begins, the greater the likelihood that you’ll be completely cured.if you don’t feel comfortable visiting your gp, you cango to your local sexual health clinic, where a healthcare professional will be able to examine you.if testicular cancer has spread to other parts of your body, you may also experience other symptoms. cancer that has spread to other parts of the body is known as metastatic cancer.around 5% of people with testicular cancer will experience symptoms of metastatic cancer.the most common place for testicular cancer to spread to is nearby lymph nodes in your abdomen or lungs. lymph nodes are glands that make up your immune system. less commonly, the cancer can spread to your liver, brain or bones.symptoms of metastatic testicular cancer can include: a persistentcough coughing or spitting up blood shortness of breath swelling and enlargement of male breasts a lump or swelling in your neck lower back painspeak to your gp as soon as possible if you notice a lump or other abnormality in your scrotum that you think may be on one of your testicles.most scrotal lumps aren’t cancerous, but if you have a lump that you think may be in one of your testicles it’s important you have it checked as soon as possible. treatment for testicular cancer is much more effective when started early.as well as asking you about your symptoms and looking at your medical history, your gp will usually need to examine your testicles.they may hold a small light or torch against your scrotum to see whether light passes through it. testicular lumps tend to be solid, which means light is unable to pass through them. a collection of fluid in the scrotum will allow light to pass through it.if you have a non-painful lump, or a change in shape or texture of one of your testicles, and your gp thinks it may be cancerous, you’ll be referred for further testing within 2 weeks.a scrotalultrasoundscanis a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your testicle. it’s one of the main ways of finding out whether or not a lump is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).during a scrotal ultrasound, your specialist will be able to determine the position and size of the abnormality in your testicle.it will also give a clear indication of whether the lump is in the testicle or separate within the scrotum, and whether it’s solid or filled with fluid. a fluid-filled lump or collection around the testis is usually harmless. a more solid lump may be a sign the swelling is cancerous.to help confirm a diagnosis, you may need a series ofblood teststo detect certain hormones in your blood, known as ‘markers’.testicular cancer often produces these markers, so if they’re in your blood it may indicate you have the condition.markers in your blood that will be tested for include: afp (alpha feta protein) hcg (human chorionic gonadotrophin)a third blood test is also often carried out as it may indicate how active a cancer is. it’s called ldh (lactate dehydrogenate), but it isn’t a specific marker for testicular cancer.not all people with testicular cancer produce markers. there may still be a chance you have testicular cancer even if your blood test results come back normal.the only way to definitively confirm testicular cancer is to examine part of the lump under a microscope. these tests and reports are called histology.unlike many cancers where a small piece of the cancer can be removed (abiopsy), in most cases the only way to examine a testicular lump is by removing the affected testicle completely.this is because the combination of the ultrasound and blood marker tests is usually sufficient to make a firm diagnosis. also, a biopsy may injure the testicle and spread cancer into the scrotum which isn’t usually affected.your specialist will only recommend removing your testicle if they’re relatively certain the lump is cancerous. losing a testicle won’t affect your sex life or ability to have children.the removal of a testicle is called an orchidectomy. it’s the main type of treatment for testicular cancer, so if you have testicular cancer it’s likely you’ll need to have an orchidectomy.in almost all cases, you’ll need further tests to check whether testicular cancer has spread. when cancer of the testicle spreads, it most commonly affects the lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen or the lungs.therefore, you may require a chestx-rayto check for signs of a tumour. you’ll also need a scan of your entire body. this is usually act scan(computerised x-ray) to check for signs of the cancer spreading. in some cases, a different type of scan, known as amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanmay be used.after all tests have been completed, it’s usually possible to determine the stage of your cancer.there are 2 ways that testicular cancer can be staged. the first is known as the tnm staging system: t – indicates the size of the tumour n – indicates whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes m – indicates whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)testicular cancer is also staged numerically. the 4 main stages are: stage 1 – the cancer is contained within your testicle and epididymis (the tube at the back of the testicle) stage 2 – the cancer has spread from the testicles into the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) at the back of the abdomen stage 3 – the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or in the neck stage 4 – the cancer has spread to the lungs or, rarely, to other tissues or organs, such as the liver, bones or braincancer research uk hasmore information about testicular cancer stages.chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the 3 main treatments for testicular cancer.your recommended treatment plan will depend on: thetype of testicular cancer you have– whether it’s a seminoma or a non-seminoma thestage of your testicular cancerthe first treatment option for all cases of testicular cancer, whatever the stage, is to surgically remove the affected testicle (an orchidectomy).for stage 1 seminomas, after the testicle has been removed, a single dose ofchemotherapymay be given to help prevent the cancer returning. a short course ofradiotherapyis also sometimes recommended.however, in many cases, the chance of recurrence is low and your doctors may recommend that you’re very carefully monitored over the next few years. further treatment is usually only needed for the small number of people who have a recurrence.for stage 1 non-seminomas, close follow-up (called surveillance) may also be recommended, or a short course of chemotherapy using a combination of different medications.for stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancers, 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy are given using a combination of different medications. further surgery is sometimes needed after chemotherapy to remove any affected lymph nodes or deposits in the lungs or, rarely, in the liver.some people with stage 2 seminomas may be suitable for less intense treatment with radiotherapy, sometimes with the addition of a simpler form of chemotherapy.in non-seminoma germ cell tumours, additional surgery may also be required after chemotherapy to remove tumours from other parts of the body, depending on the extent of the spread of the tumour.deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.before discussing your treatment options with your specialist, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask them. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.an orchidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a testicle. if you have testicular cancer, the whole of the affected testicle will need to be removed because only removing the tumour may lead to the cancer spreading.by removing the entire testicle, your chances of making a full recovery are greatly improved. your sex life and ability to father children won’t be affected.about 1 in 50 people will get a second new testicular cancer in their remaining testicle. in such circumstances, it’s sometimes possible to only remove the part of the testicle containing the tumour. you should ask your surgeon about this if you’re in this position.if testicular cancer is detected in its very early stages, an orchidectomy may be the only treatment you require.an orchidectomy isn’t carried out through the scrotum. it’s done by making an incision in your groin through which the testicle is removed with all of the tubes and blood vessels attached to the testicle that pass through the groin into the abdomen. the operation is carried out undergeneral anaesthetic.you can have an artificial (prosthetic) testicle inserted into your scrotum so that the appearance of your testicles isn’t greatly affected. the artificial testicle is usually made of silicone (a soft type of plastic). it probably won’t be exactly like your old testicle or the one you still have. it may be slightly different in size or texture.after an orchidectomy, it’s often possible to be discharged quickly, although you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. if only 1 testicle is removed, there shouldn’t be any lasting side effects.if both testicles are removed (a bi-lateral orchidectomy), you’ll be infertile. however, removing both testicles at the same time is very rarely required, and only 1 in every 50 cases require the other testicle to be removed at a later date.you may be able to bank your sperm before having a bi-lateral orchidectomy to allow you to father children if you decide to.most people are still fertile after having 1 testicle removed. however, some treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility.some people with testicular cancer may have low sperm counts because of changes that occur in the testicles before the cancer develops.for some treatments, such as chemotherapy, infertility may occur, but standard chemotherapies have a less than 50% chance of causing infertility if the remaining testicle is normal.in people who need to have post-chemotherapy removal of lumps at the back of the abdomen, known as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (rplnd), the ability to ejaculate (eject sperm from the penis) may be affected, even though the remaining testicle can still produce sperm.before your treatment begins, you may want to consider sperm banking. this is where a sample of your sperm is frozen so that it can be used at a later date to impregnate your partner during artificial insemination. before sperm banking, you may be asked to have tests forhiv,hepatitis bandhepatitis c.if you’re having complex chemotherapy for stage 2 to 4 testicular cancer, you should always be offered sperm banking. ask if you’re concerned about your fertility.not all men are suitable for sperm banking. for the technique to work, the sperm has to be of a reasonably high quality. there may also be situations where it’s considered too dangerous to delay treatment for sperm banking to take place.most nhs cancer treatment centres offer a free sperm banking service. however, it’s up to each area of the country to decide whether they store sperm for free or whether you have to pay.cancer research uk hasmore information about sperm banking, including the cost of sperm storage.if you still have a remaining testicle, in most cases (90%) your body will make enough testosterone so you won’t notice any difference.if there are any problems with your remaining testicle, you may experience symptoms due to a lack of testosterone. these symptoms can be caused for other reasons but can include: tiredness weight gain loss of libido(sex drive) reduced beard growth reduced ability to achieve or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)having both testicles removed will definitely stop you producing testosterone and you’ll develop the above symptoms.testosterone replacement therapy is where you’re given testosterone in the form of an injection, skin patch or gel to rub into your skin. if you have injections, you’ll usually need to have them every 2 to 3 months.after having testosterone replacement therapy, you’ll be able to maintain an erection and your sex drive will improve.side effects associated with this type of treatment are uncommon, and any side effects that you do experience will usually be mild. they may include: oily skin, which can sometimes trigger the onset ofacne breast enlargement and swelling a change in normal urinary patterns, such as needing to urinate more frequently or having problems passing urine (caused by anenlarged prostate glandthat puts pressure on your bladder)there are also concerns that testosterone replacement may increase the risk ofprostate cancerand you should discuss this with your doctor.however, the risks from having testosterone replacement are usually much lower than the benefits of receiving it.more advanced cases of testicular cancer may spread to your lymph nodes. lymph nodes are part of your body’s immune system, which helps protect against illness and infection.lymph node surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. the lymph nodes in your abdomen are the nodes most likely to need removing.in some cases, the nerves near the lymph nodes can become damaged, which means that rather than ejaculating semen out of your penis during sex or masturbation, the semen instead travels back into your bladder. this is known as retrograde ejaculation.if you have retrograde ejaculation, you’ll still experience the sensation of having an orgasm during ejaculation, but you won’t be able to father a child.there are a number of ways of treating retrograde ejaculation, including the use of medicines that strengthen the muscles around the neck of the bladder to prevent the flow of semen into the bladder.men and anyone with testicles who wants to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (ivf).there are also a number of newer surgical techniques that carry a lower risk of retrograde ejaculation and infertility.some people with testicular cancer have deposits of cancer in their lungs and these may also need to be removed after chemotherapy if they haven’t disappeared or reduced sufficiently in size. this type of surgery is also carried out under general anaesthetic and doesn’t usually significantly affect breathing in the long-term.a newer type of lymph node surgery, called nerve sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (rplnd), is increasingly being used because it carries a lower risk of causing retrograde ejaculation and infertility.in nerve-sparing rplnd, the site of the operation is limited to a much smaller area. this means there’s less chance of nerve damage occurring. the disadvantage is that the surgery is more technically demanding. therefore, nerve-sparing rplnd is currently only available at specialist centres that employ surgeons with the required training.laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (lrplnd) is a type of ‘keyhole’ surgery that can be used to remove the lymph nodes. during lrplnd, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions in your abdomen.an instrument called an endoscope is inserted into one of the incisions. an endoscope is a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and a camera at one end, enabling images of the inside of your body to be relayed to an external television monitor.small, surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope and can be used to remove the affected lymph nodes.the advantage of lrplnd is that there’s less post-operative pain and a quicker recovery time. also, as with nerve-sparing rplnd, in lrplnd there’s a smaller chance that nerve damage will lead to

understand there are still uncertainties about the safety and effectiveness of the procedure.radiotherapyuses high-energy beams of radiation to help destroy cancer cells. sometimes, seminomas may require radiotherapy after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.it may also be needed in advanced cases where someone is unable to tolerate the complex chemotherapies that are usually used to treat stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancer.if testicular cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may require radiotherapy after a course of chemotherapy.side effects of radiotherapycan include: reddening and soreness of the skin, which is similar tosunburn nausea diarrhoea fatiguethese side effects are usually only temporary and should improve when your treatment is completed.chemotherapyuses powerful medicines to kill the malignant (cancerous) cells in your body or stop them multiplying.you may require chemotherapy if you have advanced testicular cancer or it’s spread within your body. it’s also used to help prevent the cancer returning. chemotherapy is commonly used to treat seminomas and non-seminoma tumours.chemotherapy medicines for testicular cancer are usually injected into a vein. in some cases, a special tube called a central line is used, which stays in a vein throughout your treatment so that you don’t have to keep having blood tests or needles placed in a new vein.sometimes, chemotherapy medicines can attack your body’s normal, healthy cells. this is why chemotherapy can have many different side effects. the most common include: vomiting hair loss nausea sore mouth andmouth ulcers loss of appetite fatigue breathlessness and lung damage infertility ringing in your ears (tinnitus) skin that bleeds or bruises easily low blood counts increased vulnerability to infection numbness and tingling (pins and needles) in your hands and feet kidney damagethese side effects are usually only temporary and should improve after you’ve completed your treatment.side effects, such as infections that occur when you have a low blood count, can be life-threatening, and it’s essential that you always call your cancer care team if you’re worried between chemotherapy treatments.one of the medicines commonly used, called bleomycin, can cause long-term lung damage and you should discuss this with your doctors if damage to your lungs would have specific issues for your career or lifestyle. however, the advice may still be that you should receive it for the best chance of a cure.you shouldn’t father children while having chemotherapy and for a year after your treatment has finished. this is because chemotherapy medications can temporarily damage your sperm, increasing your risk of fathering a baby with serious birth defects. therefore, you’ll need to use a reliable method ofcontraception, such as acondom, during this time.condoms should also be used during the first 48 hours after having a course of chemotherapy. this is to protect your partner from any potentially harmful effects of the chemotherapy medication in your sperm.read more about theside effects of chemotherapy.even if your cancer has been completely cured, there’s a risk it will return. the risk of your cancer returning will depend on what stage it was at when you were diagnosed and what treatment you’ve had since.most recurrences of non-seminoma testicular cancer occur within 2 years of surgery or completion of chemotherapy. in seminomas, recurrences still occur until 3 years. recurrences after 3 years are rare, occurring in less than 5% of people.because of the risk of recurrence, you’ll need regular tests to check if the cancer has returned. these include: a physical examination blood teststo check for tumour markers a chestx-ray acomputerised tomography (ct) scanfollow-up and testing is usually recommended depending on the extent of the cancer and the treatment offered. this is usually more frequent in the first year or two but follow-up appointments may last for up to 5 years. in certain cases, it may be necessary to continue follow-up appointments for 10 years or longer.if the cancer returns following treatment for stage 1 testicular cancer, and it’s diagnosed at an early stage, it will usually be possible to cure it using chemotherapy and possibly also radiotherapy. some types of recurring testicular cancer have a cure rate of over 95%.recurrences that occur after previous combination chemotherapy can also be cured, but the chances of this will vary between individuals and you’ll need to ask your doctors to discuss this with you.cancer research uk has more information about follow-up for testicular cancer.the causes of testicular cancer are not fully understood.however, several things that increase your risk of developing the condition.undescended testicles is the most significant risk factor.when male babies grow in the womb, their testicles develop inside their abdomen. the testicles then normally move down into the scrotum when the baby is born or during their first year of life.however, for some children, the testicles fail to descend. the medical name for undescended testicles is cryptorchidism.surgery is usually required to move the testicles down. if you have had surgery to move your testicles down into your scrotum, your risk of developing testicular cancer may be increased.of surgery is performed before the child is 13 years of age, their risk of later developing testicular cancer is approximately double that of the rest of the population. however, if the operation is carried out after the boy is 13 years of age, the risk of developing testicular cancer is 5 times greater than that of the rest of the population.men and anyone with testicles who has previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are 12 times more likely to develop testicular cancer in the other testicle.for this reason, it’s important to attend follow-up appointments if you have previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer.unlike most other types of cancer, testicular cancer is more common in young and middle-aged men and anyone with testicles. men and anyone with testicles aged 30 to 34 are most likely to be diagnosed with testicular cancer.testicular cancer is more common in white men and anyone with testicles than other ethnic groups. it’s also more common in northern and western europe compared with other parts of the world.having a close relative with a history of testicular cancer increases your risk of developing it.if your father had testicular cancer, you are 4 to 6 times more likely to develop it than a person with no family history of the condition. if your brother had testicular cancer, you are 8 to 10 times more likely to develop it (having an identical twin with testicular cancer means that you are 75 times more likely to develop it).the fact that testicular cancer appears to run in families has led researchers to speculate that there may be one or more genetic mutations (abnormal changes to the instructions that control cell activity) that make a person more likely to develop testicular cancer.mutations in 2 genes (known as the kitlg and spry4 genes) may increase the risk of a person developing testicular cancer.examples of endocrine disruptors include: some types of pesticide polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs), chemical compounds used as a coolant dibutyl phthalate, a chemical used to manufacture cosmetics, such as nail polishin most countries, including the uk, many endocrine disruptors, such as pcbs, have been withdrawn as a result of their link to health problems. however, there is a concern that exposure to endocrine disruptors may still occur due to contamination of the food chain.however, there is not yet enough evidence to prove a definite link between indirect exposure to low levels of endocrine disruptors and health problems. indirect exposure is the type of exposure that would occur if the food chain was contaminated.men and anyone with testicles who are infertile are 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer. the reasons for this are not clear.research has found that long-term smokers (people who have been smoking a pack of 20 cigarettes a day for 12 years or 10 cigarettes a day for 24 years) are twice as likely to develop testicular cancer than non-smokers.studies show that men and anyone with testicles withhiv or aidshave an increased risk of testicular cancer. cancer research uk: testicular cancer healthtalk:

       " 'Testicular cancer: Teenagers and young adults': 'it can be embarrassing to talk about your testicles and any changes to them that you’ve noticed. understanding more about what they do might help.testicles are small and oval-shaped. they hang below your penis in a sac called the scrotum.from puberty, your testicles produce a hormone called testosterone. this gives you a lower voice, hair on your face and body, and makes your muscles get bigger. you also need it for your sex drive and for getting an erection.the testicles make sperm from puberty (around 13 to 14 years old) onwards. when sperm meets with a female egg during sex, this can cause pregnancy.the testicles make millions of sperm a day, but if sperm are not ejaculated they are reabsorbed back into your body.sperm wait in the epididymis next to the testicle until they are ejaculated. at ejaculation, they travel up through the spermatic cord and mix with fluid from the prostate to make semen. they go out of the body through the urethra (this is the same tube you pass urine (pee) through).lymph nodes are small and round, and connect to each other by tiny tubes that carry fluid called lymph. we have lymph nodes throughout our bodies. they are part of the lymphatic system, which protects us from infections.sometimes cancer cells from the testicle can spread to lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen (tummy). you’ll have a scan to check your lymph nodes.if you’re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our generaltesticular cancer section.you may have tests done by your gp or at the hospital. they will help your doctors see whether you have testicular cancer.if you think you might have some of the symptoms of testicular cancer, you should go to your gp. they’ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. if they think the symptoms could be because of cancer they can do tests to find out more.if your doctor thinks there is a chance you might have cancer, they’ll examine your testicles. they might also arrange for you to have an ultrasound test. this uses sound waves to take a picture of the testicles.if you need more tests you’ll be referred to a hospital. this could be a general hospital or a specialist cancer hospital.you’ll be seen by a specialist doctor (urologist), who will examine you and do the following tests: blood teststo check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers – some testicular cancers (but not all) produce high levels of these an ultrasound scan of the scrotum and testicles (if you haven’t already had one) – this can usually tell the difference between a cancer and a cyst (a harmless lump filled with fluid)if your ultrasound shows the lump is almost certainly cancer, an operation to remove a testicle (orchidectomy) is done. you’ll only have this operation if it’s necessary. your specialist will explain this to you. after the operation a doctor will use a microscope to look for cancer cells in the removed testicle.this may be the only operation you need. it will not stop you having sex or becoming a dad in the future.if testicular cancer is diagnosed you will need some other tests: more blood tests to check how well your liver and kidneys are working, and to check your tumour markers again chestx-raysto check your lungs are healthy – this is sometimes done before the operation ct,mri, orpet scansto find out if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes at the back of your abdomen (tummy), or to anywhere else in your bodyyou’ll be seen by a cancer specialist and usually a specialist nurse at a cancer treatment centre to get your test results. the results will help your specialist plan the best treatment for you.having tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier.if you need any further treatment you will have it at the cancer treatment centre.if you’re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our generaltesticular cancer section.treatment for testicular cancer can be very successful. surgery and chemotherapy are the 2 main types of treatment. often people have both treatments.to make sure you have the right treatment, your specialist needs to know what stage the cancer is. the stage of a cancer describes the tumour and whether it has spread outside the testicle. you may need some more tests to confirm what stage you are at. waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. but this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment.treatment for testicular cancer can be really successful. most young men with testicular cancer are cured, even if the cancer has spread. if you have any questions about your treatment, don’t be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse.surgeryto remove the testicle is one of the main treatments for testicular cancer. the operation is called an orchidectomy. it can be done as a day patient or during a short stay in hospital.you may feel shocked and scared at the thought of having this done. your doctor and nurse will tell you more about it so that you know what to expect.the surgeon makes a small cut (incision) through your lower abdomen (tummy) in the groin on the affected side. the testicle is pushed up from the scrotum and removed through the cut.during the operation the surgeon can put a false testicle into your scrotum so that you’ll look the same as before. your surgeon will explain this to you before the operation, or you can ask them about it. if this wasn’t done at the time of the operation, but now you think you would like this, talk to your doctor or nurse. it is a small operation to put this in later on.you’ll have a small dressing where the cut was made. this can usually be removed a day or so after the operation. the stitches in the wound will dissolve by themselves over the next few months.you’ll probably feel a bit sore and you’ll be given painkillers to take regularly. let your nurse or doctor know if they’re not controlling the pain. wearing fitted briefs or shorts that support you and loose trousers like jogging bottoms can feel more comfortable after your operation.you’ll probably feel tired and need to take things easy for about a week. you can expect to make a quick recovery after this operation.if one of your testicles is removed, you will still be able to have sex and make someone pregnant. your other testicle should produce enough of the hormone testosterone and sperm.it isn’t common to have both testicles removed. if you’ve had this done then you’ll be prescribed testosterone so you’ll still be able to have sex. but you won’t be making sperm now, so you won’t be able to make someone pregnant through sex. your doctor will talk to you about sperm banking before your surgery. storing your sperm before the operation can help you to become a dad in the future. our sections on sex and relationships and fertility have more information as well as ways of coping.if after surgery the chance of the cancer coming back is very low, your doctor might suggest you have surveillance. this means having regular checks to look for signs of the cancer coming back. if it does come back and it’s picked up very early, then it’s easy to cure. if the cancer doesn’t come back then you’ve avoided having unnecessary treatment. at each clinic appointment, your doctor will examine you and you may have blood tests and chest x-rays.going to all your surveillance appointments is really important. you could put a reminder in your phone.chemotherapyis when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells.you might be given chemotherapy: after the operation to remove your testicle, to reduce the chance of the cancer coming back to destroy cancer cells that have already spread outside the testicle if the cancer comes back occasionally before surgery, if the cancer has spreadchemotherapy can affect your fertility. before your chemotherapy starts, your doctor will talk to you about storing some of your sperm. this is called sperm banking. we have more information about fertility issues.chemotherapy is given into a vein as injections or drips. you have your chemotherapy through one of the following: a fine tube called a cannula a line into a vein in the chest (called a central line) a line into the arm (picc line) that leads into a vein in the chestfind out more about how chemotherapy is given.the amount of chemotherapy you have depends on the stage of the cancer. if the stage is low then you will have 1 to 2 cycles (sessions) of chemotherapy. if the stage is higher, or if the cancer comes back during surveillance, you’ll usually have 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy.the drugs most often used to treat testicular cancer are cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin. giving these drugs together is called bep.chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment. a cycle usually takes 3 weeks. if you have bep, you’ll usually spend 3 to 5 days of the first week having your chemotherapy as a day patient, or you might need to stay in hospital overnight. after this you’ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and again the following week.if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if it isn’t going away completely with bep, then different chemotherapy drugs can be given.different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. you will probably have a few side effects, but it’s hard to know exactly how it’s going to be you. your doctor will do everything they can to treat any side effects you have.most side effects are short-term and gradually disappear once treatment stops. the most common temporary side effects are: hair loss tiredness feeling sick or being sick (which can be controlled with medicines) being more at risk of getting an infectionthere’s more information in thechemotherapy section.sometimes side effects can be long-term. for example, although chemotherapy usually only affects fertility for a year or so, sometimes it’s permanent. read macmillan’sfertility sectionfor more information.there may be other late effects of treatment and your specialist can talk to you about this.if the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy area are still swollen after chemotherapy, they’re usually removed with an operation. lymph nodes are part of the body’s immune system and help fight infection. the lymph nodes in the tummy are called the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, so the operation is called a ‘retroperitoneal lymph node dissection’. the operation will be done by experienced surgeons in specialist centres.the lymph nodes might contain cells that could become cancerous in the future, so having them removed is the only certain way to find this out.you might be in hospital for up to 10 days. the surgeon usually makes a cut from the top of your tummy (near your breastbone) to below your belly button. this leaves you with a scar but it’ll gradually fade until it ends up looking like a fine line.sometimes you have surgery to remove any abnormal cells in areas like the lung or the lymph nodes in the chest.you’ll have a drip in your arm to give you fluids until you’re able to eat and drink normally. you’ll also have drainage tubes from the wound to stop any extra fluid collecting. the nurses will keep a check on the dressing over your wound and change it when needed. you’ll be given painkillers to take regularly. your staples (like metal stitches) are removed 7 to 10 days after the operation.it might take a few months to get back to the level of fitness you had before.this operation can affect your fertility, because the nerves that control the release of sperm (ejaculation) may be damaged by surgery. surgeons use ‘nerve-sparing’ techniques to try to stop this happening. the operation doesn’t usually stop you getting an erection or having an orgasm.if you’re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our generaltesticular cancer section.being diagnosed with cancer can have a big impact on your life, even after you’ve finishedtreatment.once you finish your treatment, you’ll have regular follow-up appointments at the hospital. you’ll have blood tests for tumour markers and sometimes other scans or x-rays. if the tumour markers go up, this can be a sign that the cancer has come back. this means you need more treatment, which can still cure the cancer.you might find it embarrassing to talk about your private parts and how the cancer or cancer treatment has affected them. it can feel awkward talking to doctors or your family about this.try not to let this put you off talking about things. it can be really helpful to let someone know how you’re feeling, so that you don’t bottle things up.fertility is the ability to have children. some cancers and cancer treatments can affect a young man’s fertility, but your doctors will always think about this when planning your treatment. your doctor will talk to you about sperm banking prior to treatment if this might happen.if only 1 of your testicles has been removed, the one left should continue to make sperm and produce enough testosterone so that your fertility is not affected. you can still have sex.if you have chemotherapy, your ability to produce sperm might be affected. after chemotherapy you can have a sample checked to see if this has happened. you can still have sex, but when you are on chemotherapy (and for a few months afterwards) you should always wear a condom to protect your partner from the chemotherapy.if you had an operation to remove both of your testicles or the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy (abdomen), your fertility and your ability to have sex may be affected. this is a really tough thing to cope with on top of everything else that you’re going through. your specialist nurse will provide support and help you find more advice and support if you feel you need it. there are things which can be done to help so that you can still have sex.if you’re looking for

they’re under 2 years old. in these circumstances, the recommended treatment is usually different.severe or persistent threadworm infections can cause: loss of appetite weight loss skin infection around the anus if bacteria enter any scratches caused by itching – wearing cotton gloves while sleeping may help prevent this difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep(insomnia) bedwettingin such cases, you should seek further advice from your gp. in very rare cases, threadworms can spread outside the intestine to the urinary tract or liver, or the vagina or womb in girls or women.threadworms lay their eggs around an infected person’s anus (bottom), usually at night. along with the eggs, the worm also secretes a mucus that causes itching.if the eggs get stuck on the person’s fingertips when they scratch, they can be transferred to their mouth or on to surfaces and clothes. if other people touch an infected surface, they can then transfer the eggs to their mouth.threadworm eggs can survive for up to 2 weeks before hatching. if the eggs hatch around the anus, the newborn worms can re-enter the bowel. eggs that have been swallowed will hatch inside the intestine. after 2 weeks, the worms reach adult size and begin to reproduce, starting the cycle again.read more aboutwhat causes threadworms.if you or your child has threadworms, everyone in your household will need to be treated as there’s a high risk of the infection spreading. this includes those who don’t have any symptoms of an infection.for most people, treatment will involve taking a single dose of a medication called mebendazole to kill the worms. if necessary, another dose can be taken after 2 weeks.during treatment and for a few weeks afterwards, it’s also important to follow strict hygiene measures to avoid spreading the threadworm eggs. this includes regularly vacuuming your house and thoroughly washing your bathroom and kitchen.if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, hygiene measures are usually recommended without medication. this is also often the case for young children.read more abouttreating threadworm infections.it’s not always possible to prevent a threadworm infection, but you can significantly reduce your risk by always maintaining good hygiene and encouraging children to do the same.children should wash their hands regularly, particularly after going to the toilet and before mealtimes. kitchen and bathroom surfaces should be kept clean.if your child is infected, encouraging them not to scratch the affected area around their anus or vagina will help prevent reinfection and reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.threadworms often go unnoticed by people who have them.however, they can cause intenseitching around the anus(and the vagina in girls), particularly at night when the female worms are laying eggs. this can disturb sleep.in some cases, you may spot threadworms on your bed clothes or sheets at night, or you may notice them in your stools. the worms look like threads of white cotton and are about 1cm long.a threadworm infection is passed from person to person by swallowing threadworm eggs.a female threadworm can lay thousands of tiny eggs around the anus or vagina. the female threadworm also releases mucus, which can cause anitchy bottom.scratching the anus or vagina, or wiping them after going to the toilet, can cause the eggs to stick to your fingertips or under your fingernails.if you don’t wash your hands, the eggs can be transferred to your mouth or on to food or objects, such as toys and kitchen utensils. if someone else touches a contaminated object, or eats contaminated food and then touches their mouth, they’ll become infected.after the eggs have been swallowed they pass into a person’s intestine, where they hatch. after about 2  weeks the threadworms will have grown into adults, at which point they’ll reproduce and the cycle of infection will start again.threadworm eggs can be transferred from your anus (or vagina) to anything you touch, including: bed sheets and bed clothes flannels and towels children’s toys kitchen utensils toothbrushes furniture kitchen or bathroom surfacesthreadworm eggs can survive on surfaces for up to two weeks.as well as being swallowed by a person who touches a contaminated object or surface, threadworm eggs can also be swallowed after being breathed in. this can happen if the eggs become airborne – for example, after shaking a contaminated towel or bed sheet.threadworms only infect humans and aren’t spread in animal faeces. however, there’s a small risk that threadworms can be caught from pets if the animal’s fur becomes contaminated with eggs after an infected person strokes it. if another person then touches the animal’s fur, the eggs could be passed on to them.threadworm infections most commonly affect young children because they often forget to wash their hands and they share toys with other children.people who are in close contact with someone with a threadworm infection also have a high risk of infection. this is why all members of a household need to be treated when someone has a threadworm infection.read more abouttreating threadworms.to treat threadworms successfully, all household members must be treated, even if they don’t have any symptoms. this is because the risk of the infection spreading is very high.the aim of treatment is to get rid of the threadworms and prevent reinfection. this will usually involve a combination of medication to kill the worms and strict hygiene measures to stop the spread of the eggs.the main medication used to treat threadworms is available from your local pharmacy without a prescription. however, it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions as it isn’t suitable for everyone.mebendazole is the main medication used to treat threadworm infections. it can be bought over the counter from your local pharmacy or prescribed by your gp. it’s available as a chewable tablet or a liquid.mebendazole works by preventing the threadworms absorbing sugar, which means they should die within a few days.this medication is 90 to 100% effective at killing the threadworms, but it doesn’t kill the eggs. this is why the hygiene measures outlined below should also be followed for 6 weeks.visit your pharmacist if the infection continues two weeks after treatment. they may recommend a second dose of medication.in rare cases, mebendazole can cause abdominal pain ordiarrhoea, particularly if the threadworm infection is severe.strict hygiene measures can help clear up a threadworm infection and reduce the likelihood of reinfection.the lifespan of threadworms is approximately 6 weeks, so it’s important that hygiene measures are followed for at least this length of time. everyone in the household must follow the advice outlined below. wash all night clothes, bed linen, towels and soft toys when you’re first diagnosed – this can be done at normal temperatures, but make sure the washing is well rinsed thoroughly vacuum and dust the whole house, paying particular attention to the bedrooms – this should be repeated regularly carefully clean the bathroom and kitchen by damp-dusting surfaces and washing the cloth frequently in hot water – this should be repeated regularly avoid shaking any material that may be contaminated with eggs, such as clothing or bed sheets – this will prevent eggs being transferred to other surfaces don’t eat food in the bedroom – you may end up swallowing eggs that have been shaken off the bedclothes keep your fingernails short – encourage other members of your household to do the same discourage nail-biting and sucking fingers – in particular, make sure children don’t suck their thumb wash your hands frequently and scrub under your fingernails – it’s particularly important to do this before eating, after going to the toilet, and before and after changing your baby’s nappy wear close-fitting underwear at night and change your underwear every morning bathe or shower regularly – it’s particularly important to bathe or shower first thing in the morning: make sure you clean around your anus and vagina to remove any eggs ensure everyone in your household has their own face flannel and towel – don’t share towels keep toothbrushes in a closed cupboard and rinse them thoroughly before usechildren can easily pick

be uncomfortable and keep coming back.some people won’t have any signs or symptoms of thrush at all.sometimes there can be too much yeast and it can cause symptoms.symptoms of thrush in women include:symptoms of thrush in men include: irritation, burning and redness around the head of the penis and under the foreskin a white discharge (like cottage cheese) an unpleasant smell difficulty pulling back the foreskinthrush can affect other areas of skin, including the armpits, groin and between your fingers.symptoms of thrush in other areas include: a red itchy or painful rash (the rash might not be easy to see on darker skin) white or yellow discharge you have symptoms of thrush for the first time you have thrush and are under 16 or over 60 thrush keeps coming back (more than 4 times in 12 months) treatment for thrush has not worked you have thrush and are pregnant or breastfeeding you have thrush and a weakened immune system – for example, because ofdiabetes,hivorchemotherapyif you think you might have thrush, get tested for free by: contacting your gp practice for an appointment booking an appointment at your local sexual health servicetesting is also available in somepharmacies.the test for thrush only takes a few seconds and isn’t usually painful, though it may be uncomfortable for a moment.it’s not always necessary to have a test for thrush. if you do have a test, a doctor or nurse may: look at the genital area use a swab (cotton bud) to collect a sample from the parts of the body that could be affected such as the vaginathrush may have similar symptoms to some stis, so it’s important you seek advice if you think you may be at risk of an sti.treatment is simple and only necessary if you have signs and symptoms of thrush.you may be given: antifungal cream to apply to the genital area vaginal pessaries (tablets that you put into your vagina) oral pills a combination of treatmentsyour doctor or nurse will tell you how to use the treatment.it’s very important to take the treatment as instructed and finish any course of treatment even if the symptoms go away earlier.you can buy antifungal treatments from mostpharmaciesif you’ve been diagnosed with thrush in the past and you know the symptoms.some antifungal products can weaken latexcondoms,diaphragmsandcaps. you should avoid sex while undergoing treatment if this is your method of contraception.you should tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you’re pregnant, might be pregnant, or if you’re breastfeeding. this may affect the type of treatment you’re given.if thrush isn’t treated it eventually goes away on its own.there’s no need for your partner(s) to have treatment unless they have signs and symptoms of thrush.your chances of developing thrush increase if: your skin is irritated or damaged you’re takingantibiotics you have poorly controlled diabetes you have a weakened immune system – for example you’re havingchemotherapyor living withhiv you’re havinghormone replacement therapy (hrt) you’re pregnant you use products that irritate the skin such as perfumed products, bubble baths or vaginal washing productssome people find that different triggers cause thrush. if you notice a pattern, you may be able to help control it.there are things you can do to relieve symptoms and stop thrush from coming back. use a soap substitute (emollient) to add moisture instead of soap – these are available in some pharmacies use non-soap bath additives such as unfragranced bath oil instead of bubble bath dry properly after washing wear cotton underwear avoid sex until thrush has cleared up if sex is uncomfortable if you do have sex, make sure your vagina is well-lubricated do not use soaps on or near your genital area, it can be drying do not let products like shampoo or conditioner run onto your genital area do not use bubble baths, essential oils or soap or shower gels in the bath as they’ll run onto the genital skin and cause irritation do not use wet wipes on the genital skin do not use feminine washing products – even if they say they are ph balanced as they disrupt healthy bacteria in the vagina do not ‘douche’ (wash out the vagina with water or other products) as it damages the healthy vaginal organisms and changes their natural balance do not wear tight underwear, tights, tight trousers or jeans do not use fabric softenersif you’re prescribed an antibiotic for another condition, remind your doctor that you tend to get thrush and ask for some preventive treatment for thrush at the same time.some people may only get thrush once. others may get it multiple times.you may need to take treatment for longer if you keep getting thrush (you get it more than 4 times in 12 months).if you get recurrent thrush the doctor or nurse will want to check that other conditions, such as diabetes, aren’t the cause of the thrush.they’ll recommend how often you should use

       " 'Thyroid cancer': 'thyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, a small gland at the base of the neck.the most common symptom of cancer of the thyroid is a painless lump or swelling that develops in the neck.other symptoms only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include: unexplained hoarseness that lasts for more than a few weeks asore throator difficulty swallowing that doesn’t get better a lump elsewhere in your neckif you have a lump in your thyroid gland, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have thyroid cancer. about 1 in 20 thyroid lumps are cancerous.read more about thesymptoms of thyroid cancerthe thyroid gland consists of 2 lobes located on either side of the windpipe. its main purpose is to release hormones (chemicals that have powerful effects on many different functions of the body).the thyroid gland releases 3 separate hormones: triiodothyronine – known as t3 thyroxine – known as t4 calcitoninthe t3 and t4 hormones help regulate the body’s metabolic rate (the rate at which the various processes in the body work, such as how quickly calories are burnt).an excess of t3 and t4 will make you feel overactive and you may lose weight. if you don’t have enough of these hormones, you’ll feel sluggish and you may gain weight.calcitonin helps control blood calcium levels. calcium is a mineral that performs a number of important functions, such as building strong bones.calcitonin isn’t essential for maintaining good health because your body also has other ways of controlling calcium.there are 4 main types of thyroid cancer. they are: papillary carcinoma – this is the most common type, accounting for about 6 out of 10 (60%) cases; it usually affects people under the age of 40, particularly women follicular carcinoma – accounts for around 3 out of 20 (15%) cases of thyroid cancer and tends to affect older adults medullary thyroid carcinoma – accounts for between 5 and 8 out of every 100 diagnosed cases (5% to 8%); unlike the other types of thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma can run in families anaplastic thyroid carcinoma – this is the rarest and most aggressive type of thyroid cancer, accounting for less than 1 in 20 thyroid cancers; it usually affects older people over the age of 60papillary and follicular carcinomas are sometimes known as differentiated thyroid cancers, and they’re often treated in the same way.thyroid cancer is a rare form ofcancer,accounting for less than 1% of all cancer cases in the uk.it’s most common in people aged 35 to 39 years and in those aged 70 years or over.women are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. it’s unclear why this is, but it may be a result of the hormonal changes associated with the female reproductive system.in most cases, the cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. however, certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.risk factors for thyroid cancer include: having a benign (non-cancerous) thyroid condition having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer) having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis acromegaly – a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone having a previous benign (non-cancerous) breast condition weight and height radiation exposureread more about thecauses of thyroid cancera type ofblood testknown as a thyroid function test will measure the hormone levels in your blood and rule out or confirm other thyroid problems.if nothing else seems to be causing the lump in your thyroid, fine-needle aspiration cytology (fnac) is used.further testing may be required if the fnac results are inconclusive, or if more information is needed to make your treatment more effective.read more abouthow thyroid cancer is diagnosed.your recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether a complete cure is realistically achievable.differentiated thyroid cancers (dtcs) are treated using a combination of surgery to remove the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) and a type ofradiotherapythat destroys any remaining cancer cells and prevents the thyroid cancer returning.medullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than dtcs, so it may be necessary to remove any nearby lymph nodes, as well as your thyroid gland.read more abouttreating thyroid cancercancerous cells will return in an estimated 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer. in approximately 10% to 15% of people, the cancerous cells will come back in other parts of their body, such as their bones.cancerous cells can sometimes return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.you’ll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that return can be treated quickly.read more about thecomplications of thyroid cancerfrom the available evidence, eating ahealthy, balanced dietis the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer.a low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) and whole grains.in its early stages, thyroid cancer tends to cause no or very few symptoms.the main symptom of thyroid cancer is a lump or swelling at the front of the neck just below your adam’s apple, which is usually painless.women also have adam’s apples, but they’re much smaller and less prominent than a man’s.the lymph nodes in your neck can also be affected and become swollen. lymph nodes are small glands that are part of the lymphatic system, which helps fight infection.other symptoms of thyroid cancer only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include: unexplained hoarseness that doesn’t get better after a few weeks asore throator difficulty swallowing that doesn’t get better pain in your neckyou should always speak to your gp if you develop a swelling or lump at the front of your neck. although it’s unlikely to be thyroid cancer, it’s important that it is investigated.about 1 in 20 swellings or lumps in the neck are caused by thyroid cancer. most cases are caused by non-cancerous swellings called goitres.a goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland. non-cancerous goitres are usually caused by other less serious problems with your thyroid gland, such as: too much triiodothyronine (t3) and thyroxine (t4) hormones – this is known as having anoveractive thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism not enough t3 and t4 hormones – this is known as having anunderactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidismthebutterfly thyroid cancer trustprovides information, advice and support for people with thyroid cancer.as well as the website, they also have a helpline number that can be contacted on 01207 545469, monday to friday, 10am to 4pm.in most cases, the exact cause of thyroid cancer is unknown.however, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing the condition, including having another thyroid condition and being exposed to radiation.cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the dna in cells, which can affect how they grow. this means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system. the lymphatic system is made up of a network of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) located throughout the body.lymph nodes produce many of the cells needed by your immune system (the body’s natural defence system against infection and illness).once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it’s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs.the most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas, which are known as differentiated thyroid cancers (dtcs).they spread much more slowly than other types of cancer. when dtcs are diagnosed, they’re usually limited to the thyroid gland itself or nearby lymph nodes.the rarer types of thyroid cancer are more aggressive and spread faster. by the time medullary thyroid carcinoma is diagnosed, it may have spread to the lymph nodes. in advanced cases, it may have also spread to the bones and lungs.anaplastic thyroid cancer often spreads to the windpipe and, in some cases, the lungs.the main risk factors for developing thyroid cancer are: having a thyroid condition having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer) having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) acromegaly (a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone) having previous benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions weight and height radiation exposureyour risk of developing thyroid cancer is slightly increased if you have certain non-cancerous (benign) thyroid conditions, such as an inflamed thyroid gland (thyroiditis) or an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre).having anoveractive thyroid gland(hyperthyroidism) or anunderactive thyroid gland(hypothyroidism) doesn’t increase your chances of developing thyroid cancer.around 1 in 5 cases of thyroid cancer occur in people who’ve had a previous benign thyroid condition.inherited genetic mutations are responsible for a small number of medullary thyroid carcinomas. if the instructions carried in genes are altered, some of the body’s processes won’t work normally.this inherited mutation occurs in: familial medullary thyroid cancer multiple endocrine neoplasia (men) syndrome, types 2a and 2bin cases of men2a or men2b thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop during childhood or the teenage years. in familial medullary thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop in adulthood.if one of your parents has a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or men syndrome, you should consider having ablood testto find out whether you have the mutated genes. if your test results are positive, it’s recommended you have surgery to remove your thyroid gland as a precaution.if you have a bowel condition called familial adenomatous polyposis (fap), your risk of developing thyroid cancer is increased. fap runs in families and is caused by inheriting a faulty gene.macmillan cancer support have more information aboutfamilial adenomatous polyposis.thyroid cancer risk is increased in people who have acromegaly. this is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone.if you’ve had a benign (non-cancerous) breast condition in the past, such as a breast cyst or fibroadenoma (non-cancerous tumour), your risk of developing thyroid cancer increases by around half (50%) compared with women who haven’t had this type of condition.if you’re overweight, you’re more at risk of developing thyroid cancer than someone who isn’t overweight.research has also shown that taller adults have an increased risk. however, the reasons for this are unclear.exposure to radiation during childhood is another risk factor for thyroid cancer.radiation from nuclear fallout and radiation used for medical treatments have both been associated with thyroid cancer.many recently reported cases of thyroid cancer are thought to have been caused by radiation exposure during medical procedures carried out between 1910 and 1960.during this time, not much was known about the risks of radiation treatment. today there are much stricter regulations regarding the use of radiation for medical procedures.if your diet contains low levels of the trace element iodine, you’re at an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer.people exposed to radiation, or those with a history of benign thyroid conditions, are more likely to have low levels of iodine.eating a lot of butter, cheese and meat may also increase your risk of developing thyroid cancer. to help reduce your risk, you should include plenty of freshfruit and vegetablesin your diet.people with a highbody mass index (bmi)also have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer.women are about 2 to 3 times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men.it’s thought this may be because of the hormones released during a woman’s monthly period or during pregnancy. however, there’s little scientific evidence to support this theory.for many people, the first stage of diagnosing thyroid cancer is a consultation with a gp.your gp will examine your neck and ask about any associated symptoms you may be experiencing, such as unexplained hoarseness.a blood test known as a thyroid function test is used to check whether the swelling in your neck is caused by other problems with your thyroid gland.it will rule out conditions such as anoveractive thyroid gland(hyperthyroidism) or anunderactive thyroid gland(hypothyroidism), which are the most common thyroid problems.a thyroid function test measures the amount of certain types of hormones in your blood.further tests will be needed if the thyroid function test reveals your thyroid gland is working normally.fine-needle aspiration cytology (fnac) is the next stage in diagnosing thyroid cancer. it’s an outpatient procedure, which means you won’t have to spend the night in hospital.a small needle is inserted into the lump in your neck to allow a tiny sample of cells to be removed. the sample is then studied under a microscope.this test can usually reveal whether cancerous cells are present in your thyroid gland and, if they are, what type of thyroid cancer you have.further testing may be recommended if the fnac results are inconclusive or if further information is needed to make your treatment more effective. these tests may include: repeat fnac combined with anultrasound scan other types of scan, such as acomputerised tomography (ct) scanormagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanin most cases, surgery will be recommended to remove the part of the thyroid gland that contains the lump or swelling when it hasn’t been possible to rule out thyroid cancer.if you’re diagnosed with thyroid cancer, you’ll be assigned a care team, who will devise a treatment plan for you.your recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether your care team thinks that a complete cure is realistically achievable.all nhs hospitals have multidisciplinary teams (mdts) that treat thyroid cancer. an mdt is made up of a number of different specialists, and may include: a surgeon an endocrinologist (a specialist in treating hormonal conditions) an oncologist (a cancer treatment specialist) a pathologist (a specialist in diseased tissue) a radiotherapist or clinical oncologist (a specialist in non-surgical methods of treating cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy) a specialist cancer nurse, who will usually be your first point of contact with the rest of the teamdeciding on the best course of treatment can be difficult. your cancer team will make recommendations after reviewing your case, but the final decision will be yours.before you go to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. for example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are.your recommended treatment will depend on a number of things, including: the type of thyroid cancer you have the grade of your cancer whether your care team thinks a complete cure is realistically achievablemost differentiated thyroid cancers – papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas – and some medullary thyroid carcinomas have a good prospect of achieving a cure.differentiated thyroid cancers are treated using a combination of: surgery to remove your thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) a type of radiotherapy called radioactive iodine treatment, which is designed to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the thyroid cancer returningmedullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than differentiated thyroid cancers, so it may be necessary to remove your thyroid gland and any nearby lymph nodes.radiotherapy iodine treatment is not effective at treating this type of thyroid cancer.stage 4 medullary thyroid carcinomas aren’t usually curable, but it should be possible to slow their progression and control any associated symptoms.in most cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a cure isn’t usually achievable. this is because it’s usually spread to other parts of the body by the time it’s been diagnosed.radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used to slow the progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and help control any symptoms.some cases of differentiated thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma may benefit from a new type of treatment known as targeted therapies.this is where medication is used to directly target the cancerous cells. however, these types of treatments are currently undergoing clinical trials and aren’t offered routinely on the nhs.in almost all cases of thyroid cancer it’s necessary to either remove some of your thyroid gland in a procedure called a hemithyroidectomy, or all of your thyroid gland (total thyroidectomy).this decision will be influenced by: the type of thyroid cancer you have the size of the tumour whether or not the cancer has spread beyond your thyroid glandyour surgeon should discuss with you the type of surgery required and why so you can make an informed decision.a thyroidectomy is carried out under ageneral anaestheticand usually takes around 2 hours. the operation will leave a small scar on your neck, which shouldn’t be very noticeable. in a small number of cases, it may cause permanent hoarseness.most people are well enough to leave hospital 3 to 5 days after having thyroid surgery. however, you’ll need to rest at home for 2 to 3 weeks and avoid any activities that could put a strain on your neck, such as heavy lifting.a member of your care team will be able to advise you about when you’ll be fit enough to resume normal activities and return to work.if some or all of your thyroid gland is removed, it will no longer be able to produce the hormones that regulate your metabolic system.this means you’ll experiencesymptoms of an underactive thyroid(hypothyroidism), such as fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight gain and dry skin.to compensate, you’ll need to take replacement hormone tablets for the rest of your life.if your surgery is to be followed by radioactive iodine treatment, it’s likely you’ll be given a hormone tablet called triiodothyronine.after radioactive iodine treatment is completed, you’ll be prescribed an alternative hormone tablet called thyroxine, which most people only need to take once a day.you’ll need to have regularblood teststo check you’re receiving the right amount of hormones and to determine whether your dose needs to be adjusted.it may take some time to achieve the optimum dose. until this time, you may experience symptoms of tiredness or weight gain if your hormone levels are too low.alternatively, if your hormone levels are too high, you may experience symptoms such as weight loss, hyperactivity or diarrhoea. you shouldn’t experience any more side effects once the right dose has been achieved.occasionally, the parathyroid glands can be affected during surgery. the parathyroid glands are located close to the thyroid gland and help regulate the levels of calcium in your blood.if your parathyroid glands are affected, your calcium levels may decrease, which can cause a tingling sensation in your hands, fingers, lips and around your nose.these symptoms should be reported to your mdt or gp as you may need to take calcium supplements. most people only need to take a short course of calcium tablets as the parathyroid glands will soon start to function normally again.after having thyroid surgery, a course of radioactive iodine treatment may be recommended. this will help destroy any remaining cancer cells in your body and prevent the cancer returning.if you’re taking thyroid hormone replacement tablets, you’ll need to stop taking them for 2 to 4 weeks before having radioactive iodine treatment. this is because they can interfere with the effectiveness of the iodine treatment.if withdrawing your hormone replacement treatment is problematic, you may be given a medicine called recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhtsh). this is given as an injection on 2 consecutive days.your mdt will be able to advise you about whether or not rhtsh is suitable for you.radioactive iodine treatment involves swallowing radioactive iodine in either liquid or capsule form. the radiation in the iodine travels up into your neck through your blood supply and destroys any cancerous cells.side effects of radioactive iodine treatment are uncommon, but a small number of people may experience tightness, pain or swelling in their neck and may feel flushed (warm). these side effects usually pass within 24 hours.after treatment, you may have adry mouthand notice a change in your taste. these symptoms usually disappear after a few weeks or months, although they can be permanent in some people.you’ll need to stay in hospital for 3 to 5 days after the procedure because the iodine will make your body slightly radioactive. as a precaution, you’ll need to stay in a single room protected by lead sheets so that hospital staff aren’t exposed to radiation.you won’t be able to have visitors during this time and hospital staff will keep their contact with you to a minimum.your bodily fluids, such as urine, will also be slightly radioactive for 3 to 5 days after your treatment, so it’s important that you flush the toilet every time you use it. your sweat will be radioactive, too, so you should bathe or shower every day.you’ll be allowed home after the radioactive levels in your body have subsided.while having radioactive iodine treatment, you’ll need to eat a diet low in iodine. an iodine-rich diet may reduce the effectiveness of your treatment. it’s recommended that you: avoid all seafood limit the amount of dairy products you eat don’t take cough medicines or use sea salt as they both contain iodineyou should eat plenty of fresh meat, freshfruit and vegetables, and pasta and rice. these are all low in iodine.you shouldn’t have radioactive iodine treatment if you’re pregnant or if there’s a good chance that you may be. the treatment could damage your baby.tell a member of your care team if you’re unsure whether you’re pregnant. any treatment will need to be delayed until after your pregnancy.you must stop breastfeeding before you can be treated with radioactive iodine. if possible, you should stop breastfeeding 6 weeks prior to treatment.you should not resume breastfeeding after treatment for your current child, but you may safely breastfeed any babies you may have in the future.breastfeeding also isn’t recommended while receiving iodine treatment. if you’re breastfeeding, you should stop at least 4 weeks (but preferably 8) before starting iodine treatment.you should also not resume breastfeeding your baby. however, it’s safe for you to breastfeed if you have another child in the future.you should use a reliable method ofcontraceptionfor at least 6 months after having iodine treatment. this is because there’s a small risk that any child conceived during this time could develop birth defects. this applies to both men and women.radioactive iodine treatment doesn’t affect fertility in women. however, there’s a small risk that it could affect fertility in men who need to have multiple treatment sessions. your care team will be able to advise you about the level of risk in your individual circumstances.if there’s a significant risk you’ll become infertile after having radioactive iodine treatment, you may wish to consider having your sperm or eggs harvested and frozen so they can be used for fertility treatment at a later date.externalradiotherapy, where radioactive waves are targeted at affected parts of the body, is usually only used to treat advanced or anaplastic thyroid carcinomas.the length of time you’ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on the particular type of thyroid cancer you have and its progression.side effects of radiotherapy include: nausea vomiting tiredness pain when swallowing dry mouththese side effects should pass 2 to 3 weeks after your course of radiotherapy has finished.chemotherapyis usually only used to treat anaplastic thyroid carcinomas that have spread to other parts of your body.it involves taking powerful medicines that kill cancerous cells. it’s rarely successful in curing anaplastic cancer, but can slow its progression and help relieve symptoms.possible side effects of chemotherapy include: nausea vomiting tiredness loss of appetite hair loss mouth ulcersif you’re receiving chemotherapy, you’ll also be more vulnerable to infection. see your gp if you suddenly feel ill or your temperature rises above 38c (100.4f).a number of targeted therapies are being tested in clinical trials to treat advanced cases of: medullary thyroid cancers differentiated thyroid cancers that don’t respond to radioactive iodine anaplastic thyroid carcinomasin targeted therapies, medication specifically targets the biological functions that cancers need to grow and spread.as research is ongoing, some medications used in this type of treatment are unlicensed. in exceptional circumstances, your specialist may suggest using an unlicensed medication. they’ll do this if: they think it’s likely to be effective there are no better alternatives the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risksif your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication, they’ll tell you that it’s unlicensed and will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you.the decision about whether to fund treatment with medications used in targeted therapies is often made by individual clinical commissioning groups (ccgs).cancerous cells can return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.it’s estimated that 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer will experience a return of cancerous cells in their neck.an estimated 10% to 15% of people will see a return of cancerous cells in other parts of their body, such as their bones.because of the risk of cancer cells returning, you’ll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that do return can be treated quickly.thyroglobulin testing is a special type of blood test that’s used to monitor some types of thyroid cancer and to check for the return of cancerous cells.thyroglobulin is a protein released by a healthy thyroid gland, but it can also be released by cancerous cells.if you’ve had your thyroid gland removed, there should be no thyroglobulin present in your blood, unless cancerous cells have returned.regularly testing your blood for thyroglobulin can be an effective way of checking whether or not any cancerous cells have returned.for the first few years after having surgery you’ll probably need to have thyroglobulin testing every 6 months. after this period, you’ll need to be tested once a year.an ultrasound scanner uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of part of the inside of the body. anultrasound scancan detect changes inside your neck that could indicate the recurrence of cancer.after surgery to remove part or all of your thyroid gland, you may be asked to attend a radioactive iodine scanning test.you swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine before undergoing a scan. the radioactive iodine will highlight any cancerous thyroid cells in the body.before the scan, you’ll need to go on a low-iodine diet and stop taking your thyroid hormone medication.as only a small dose of radioactive iodine is used, it’s not necessary to keep your distance from others. however, if you think you may be pregnant or you’re breastfeeding, let the doctors know before your test.a radioactive iodine scan will usually be carried out 6 to 8 months after surgery. overactive thyroid underactive thyroid british thyroid foundation butterfly thyroid cancer trust cancer research

usually examine you and arrange some blood tests. there may be a number of reasons why you have these symptoms. if your gp is concerned that you may have thyroid cancer they will make an appointment for you with a specialist at the hospital.you’ll probably be seen by lots of people at the hospital during and after the tests they do to find out what is happening to you. they work as a team and all have an important part in your care, even though you may only meet some of them.they may include: a doctor who specialises in thyroid problems (endocrinologist) a surgeon who specialises in thyroid surgery a pathologist who looks at blood and tissue samples to diagnose diseases a cancer specialist (oncologist) an x-ray specialist (radiologist) a clinical nurse specialistyour doctor will examine you and arrange for more detailed tests, which may include an ultrasound, a fine needle aspiration (fna) or a biopsy.an fna involves having a very small needle placed into your thyroid gland to remove a few cells for the pathologist to look at under the microscope.a biopsy involves removing a small piece of the thyroid to be analysed. you might have a general anaesthetic and so will be asleep when it is done. you may only need a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area. there is more information about having an anaesthetic in the surgery section.if the biopsy shows that it is thyroid cancer you will have some other tests to check the size of the tumour and whether it has spread. macmillan cancer support has information on these tests. these tests may include: a chest x-rayto check your lungs act,mriorpetscan a radioisotope scanyou won’t necessarily need all of these tests. it will depend on the results of the first ones.having tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse or doctor can help.if you’re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our generalthyroid cancerinformation.it’s important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. most young people are completely cured. if the tests you’ve had show you have thyroid cancer, your team of specialists will discuss treatment with you.surgery to remove the thyroid gland is the main treatment for thyroid cancer. you might hear the doctors talk about a thyroidectomy, which is the medical name for the operation. sometimes the surgeon will only need to remove part of your thyroid.in the neck, close to the thyroid, there are lymph nodes. these are part of the body’s immune system and help fight infection. sometimes cancer cells settle in these lymph nodes, so the surgeon might remove some or all of the nodes as well. they may also remove some tissue from the area around the thyroid if they suspect that there are any cancer cells there.you will probably need to spend a few days in hospital after the operation. there will be a scar on your neck – usually just above the collarbone. sometimes you can have a low calcium level in your blood or a hoarse voice after the operation. you may need to take tablets to replace the thyroid hormone.the tissue removed will be carefully looked at under the microscope. sometimes another operation is needed after this. the results will help your doctors decide if you need radioactive iodine treatment and other treatments. your team will talk through the results of the operation with you.you may feel really shocked and scared by the thought of having this operation. but it does give a really good chance of a cure. your specialist will talk things over with you in detail and make sure that you fully understand what’s involved. if you want to know more about what happens when you go in for an operation, there’s lots more information in the general surgery section.if you’ve been told that you need to have treatment with radioactive iodine, you may be worried about what’s going to happen. knowing what to expect can help.your doctors and nurses will also explain things to you and give you support.there’s a mineral called iodine in the bloodstream. normal thyroid tissue takes iodine from the bloodstream and uses it to make thyroid hormones. some thyroid cancers can take iodine from the bloodstream too.radioactive iodine is often used after surgery when the whole thyroid gland has been removed. any thyroid cancer cells left behind soak up the iodine which contains high doses of radiation. this helps to destroy them. radioactive iodine doesn’t usually affect other parts of the body because other cells don’t take up iodine the way thyroid cells do.you may have radioactive iodine as a capsule, as a drink or as an injection into a vein in your arm through a cannula.there are 2 ways to prepare your body for the radioiodine treatment, either you’ll: be given an injection of a drug called thyrotropin alfa (thyrogen®) need to stop taking your thyroid hormone tablets 2 to 4 weeks before the treatmentsome people won’t be started on thyroid hormones until after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment. you’ll probably feel very tired during this time. but, if you are not having the injections, it’s important that you stop taking thyroid hormones or the radioactive iodine treatment won’t work.for 2 weeks before treatment, you’ll be asked to eat a low-iodine diet and avoid certain foods. this encourages the body to use up its stores of iodine. then when the radioactive iodine is given, the cancer cells will soak it up because the amount of iodine in the body is so low. you’ll be given information about what foods you should eat and what to avoid.you can’t have this treatment if you are pregnant. if there is any chance of this tell your team and they can test you.this treatment makes you slightly radioactive for several weeks. your body will gradually get rid of the radioactivity through your wee, sweat and saliva. you will be kept in hospital when the radioactivity is highest, which is usually between 1 to 5 days. you will be looked after in a side room on the ward, either on your own or with someone else having the same treatment.during this treatment, the amount of contact you can have with your friends, family and the nurses will be limited, to protect them from exposure to the radiation. anyone pregnant or younger than 18 usually isn’t allowed to visit. this can make you feel lonely. you will be able to keep in touch with your friends and family by phone and internet. there should be plenty of books, magazines, dvds, computer games and a tv in the room. you can take in a few of your own things in to help pass the time. ask your team whether you can take a computer or an mp3 player into the room with you. anything that comes back out of your room will be checked for radiation levels. sometimes your things may have to be kept on the ward for a while if the radiation levels are high. but they’ll be returned to you when they’re safe again.once your radiation levels are safe, you’ll be allowed home. you’ll also be able to start eating your usual foods again. check with the staff about what you can and can’t do when you get home. there are likely to be some precautions to take for up to a few weeks.you might need a scan shortly after your treatment. this shows if you need more radioiodine treatment. if you need more treatment it is usually given every 3 to 6 months.your fertility won’t be affected by the treatment. but it’s safer not to become pregnant or get someone else pregnant during treatment, and for a year after. you should avoid all sex and open-mouthed kissing for a few days after treatment.travelling on public transport can be restricted just after treatment, so you may not be able to go on holiday just after treatment. for a few months after treatment you might set off the alarms at the security gates. if you are planning a holiday, discuss it with your team.you may also have external beam radiotherapy. for this treatment you come to hospital and lie on a bed in the radiotherapy department for about 10 to 20 minutes every day. you will have treatment every weekday for several weeks. it is like having an x-ray, so it doesn’t hurt and you cannot feel it.if you’ve had all your thyroid gland removed, your body can’t produce thyroid hormones anymore. without these hormones, your metabolism slows down. this can cause dry skin and hair, tiredness, poor concentration and lack of energy.these hormones can be replaced by taking tablets. you’ll need to take them for the rest of your life. the usual long-term hormone treatment is thyroxine (levothyroxine) and you normally start taking it once your radioactive iodine treatment is finished.as well as replacing the hormones you’re missing, thyroxine can also help stop papillary or follicular thyroid cancer coming back. so if you have only had part of your thyroid gland removed you may still need to take thyroid hormone tablets.you’ll need to have yourbloodchecked regularly to monitor the hormone levels. it can sometimes take months to find the right dose of thyroxine for you. but once the right dose is found, there shouldn’t be any side effects, because they are simply replacing normal thyroid hormones.it’s important to remember to take your tablets every day. it can help to take them at the same time every day so you get into a routine.macmillan cancer support has more general information aboutradiotherapy,surgeryandradioactive iodine treatment. this information is written for people of all ages, not just

you have dental caries you might have:visit your dentist regularly, so early tooth decay can be treated as soon as possible and the prevention of decay can begin. tooth decay is much easier and cheaper to treat in its early stages. dentists can usually identify tooth decay and further problems with a simple examination orx-ray.find your nearest dentistit’s also important to have regulardental check-ups. adults should have a check-up at least once every 2 years and children under the age of 18 should have a check-up at least once a year.read more ongetting over a fear of the dentisttreatment of tooth decay depends on how advanced it is.for early stage tooth decay – your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. they may apply afluoridegel, varnish or paste to the area. fluoride helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay.your dentist may discuss a filling or crown with you. this involves removing the dental decay, offeringlocal anaestheticto numb the tooth and filling the hole.if tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) – this may be removed in a process known as root canal treatment.if the tooth is so badly damaged that it can’t be restored – it may need to be removed. your dentist may be able to replace the tooth with a partialdenture, bridge or implant.nhs charges are set by the government and are standard for all nhs patients. charges are assessed each year and usually change every april.some people don’t have to pay for dental treatment, including children, pregnant women and new mothers. financial help may also be available to those on a low income.the cost of private dental treatment varies between practices, as there is no set charge. if you choose to see a private dentist, make sure to agree the cost before having treatment.although tooth decay is a common problem, it’s often entirely preventable. the best way to avoid tooth decay is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. for example, you should: visit your dentist regularly – your dentist will decide how often they need to see you based on the condition of your mouth, teeth and gums cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks, particularly between meals or within an hour of going to bed – some medications can also contain sugar, so it’s best to look for sugar-free alternatives where possible look after your teeth and gums – brushing your teeth properly with a

use a children’s toothpaste, but make sure to read the label about how to use it.children should still brush their teeth twice a day, especially before bedtime.your mouth is full of bacteria that form a film over the teeth called dental plaque.when you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates – particularly sugary foods and drinks – the bacteria in plaque turn the carbohydrates into energy they need, producing acid at the same time.if the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities.once cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). as the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up.without treatment, bacteria will enter the pulp (the soft centre of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels). at this stage, your nerves will be exposed to bacteria, usually making your tooth painful.the bacteria can cause a dental abscess in the pulp and the infection could spread into the bone, causing another type ofabscess.',\n",
       " 'Toothache': 'if you have a dental problem you should, in the first instance alwaysphone the dental practice that you normally attend.if you are not registered with any dental practice thenyour nearest dental practicewill still be able to help.toothache refers to pain in and around the teeth and jaws that’s usually caused by tooth decay.you may feel toothache in many ways. it can come and go or be constant. eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold.the pain can also be mild or severe. it may feel sharp and start suddenly. it can be worse at night, particularly when you’re lying down. a lost filling or broken tooth can sometimes start the pain.it can also sometimes be difficult to decide whether the pain is in your upper or lower teeth. when a lower molar tooth is affected, the pain can often feel like it’s coming from the ear.toothache in other upper teeth may feel like it’s coming from the sinuses, the small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead.the area of your jaw close to the infected tooth may also be sore and tender to touch.it’s also possible for periodontal disease to give rise to a dull pain. periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that affects the soft and hard structures that support the teeth.if you have toothache for more than one or two days, visit your dentist as soon as possible to have it treated. the longer you leave it, the worse it will get.if your toothache isn’t treated, the pulp inside your tooth will eventually become infected. this can usually lead to adental abscess, with severe and continuous throbbing pain.painkillers, such asparacetamolandibuprofen, may reduce the pain and discomfort while you’re waiting for an appointment. children under 16 years of age shouldn’t be given aspirin.find a dentist near youtoothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. the pulp is made up of sensitive nerves and blood vessels.dental pulp can become inflamed as a result of:there are a number of other conditions that can cause pain similar to toothache, even though the pulp isn’t affected. these include: periodontal abscess – a collection of pus in the gums caused by a bacterial infection ulcers on your gums sore or swollen gums around a tooth that’s breaking through – for example, when your wisdom teeth start to come through sinusitis– which sometimes causes pain around the upper jaw an injury to the joint that attaches the jaw to the skull (temporomandibular joint)babies can also experience discomfort when their teeth start to develop. this is known as teething.the type of treatment you have for toothache will depend on the cause of the pain, so your dentist will examine your mouth and may carry out anx-rayto try to identify the problem.if your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling.if your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place.if the pulp inside your tooth is infected, you may need root canal treatment. this procedure involves removing the infected pulp and then inserting a special type of filling to seal the tooth and prevent reinfection.your tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can’t be treated using these methods or the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted).the best way to avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. to do this, you should: limit your intake of sugary foods and drinks – you should have these as an occasional treat and only at mealtimes; read more about cutting down on sugar brush your teeth twice a day using a toothpaste that containsfluoride– gently brush your gums and tongue as well clean between your teeth using dental floss and, if necessary, use a mouthwash stop smoking – smoking can make some dental problems worsemake sure you have regulardental check-ups, preferably with the same dentist.the time between check-ups can vary, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are and your risk of developing future problems.your dentist will suggest when you should have your next check-up based on your overall oral health.children should have a dental check-up every six months so tooth decay can be spotted and treated early.read more abouttaking care of your teethandkeeping your teeth clean. dental abscess gum disease tooth decay',\n",
       " 'Transient ischaemic attack (TIA)': 'a transient ischaemic attack (tia), or mini stroke, happens when there is a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain.the disruption in blood supply results in a lack of oxygen to the brain. this can cause sudden symptoms like those of astroke.however, a tia does not last as long as a stroke. the effects only last for a few minutes or hours and fully resolve within 24 hours.do not drive if you suspect you have had a stroke or tia (transient ischaemic attack).like a stroke, the signs and symptoms of a tia usually begin suddenly.the main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word fast.fast stands for: face – the face might drop on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth may have dropped, and their eyelid may droop arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm speech – they might slur their speech or it might be garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake time – it’s time to phone 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptomsit’s important to be aware of the symptoms of a stroke or tia, especially if you live with or care for somebody in a high-risk group, such as an elderly person or someone withdiabetesorhigh blood pressure.symptoms in the fast test identify most strokes and tias. tias sometimes cause different symptoms that appear suddenly (usually over a few seconds).other signs and symptoms may include: complete paralysis of one side of the body sudden loss or blurring of vision dizziness confusion difficulty understanding what others are saying problems with balance and co-ordinationhowever, there may be other causes for these symptoms.during a tia, it’s not possible to tell whether you’re having a tia or a full stroke, so it’s important to phone 999 immediately. even if the symptoms disappear, you should still have an assessment at hospital.a tia is a warning that you’re at risk of having a full stroke. an assessment can help doctors decide the best way to reduce the chances of this happening.tias happen when there is a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain.in tias, the blockage resolves before any significant damage. a fullstrokedisrupts the blood flow to your brain for much longer. this leads to more severe damage to the brain and longer-term problems.the blockage responsible for most tias is usually caused by ablood clotthat has travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain.a type of irregular heartbeat calledatrial fibrillationcan also cause tias. it can create blood clots that escape from the heart and become stuck in the blood vessels that supply the brain.there are some things that can make you more likely to have a stroke or tia: poor diet lack of exercise obesity smoking an excessive alcohol intake high cholesterol high blood pressure(hypertension) diabetes atrial fibrillationlifestyle changes can help control some of these risk factors. you may also need to take regular medication.taking anticoagulant medication if you have an irregular heartbeat due toatrial fibrillationwill help reduce the risk of stroke.if you’ve had a stroke or tia, these measures are particularly important because you’re more likely to have another stroke in future.there are some risk factors you can’t change like: age – people over 65 are most at risk of having strokes, although they can happen at any age – including in children family history – if a close relative (parent, grandparent, brother or sister) has had a stroke, your risk is likely to be higher ethnicity – if you’re south asian, african or caribbean, your risk of stroke is higher, partly because rates of diabetes and high blood pressure are higher in these groups your medical history – if you’ve had astroke, transient ischaemic attack (tia) orheart attack, your risk of stroke is higheryou should have an assessment in hospital as soon as possible if you think you’ve had a tia.tias are often over very quickly, so you may not have any symptoms by the time you see a doctor.you should tell the person assessing you about the symptoms you experienced and how long they lasted. this will help to rule out other conditions that may have caused your symptoms.even if you no longer have symptoms, you might still need a neurological examination. this involves simple tasks designed to check your strength, sensation and co-ordination skills.if a tia is suspected, you’ll see a specialist for further tests as soon as possible.you’ll normally take aspirin while you’re waiting for specialist assessment. this can help to reduce your risk of having a stroke or another tia in the meantime.it’s likely you’ll see a doctor who specialises in strokes.you might have some tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms and to help identify the underlying cause of your tia.you might needblood teststo determine whether you havehigh cholesterol, and to check if you havediabetes.anelectrocardiogram (ecg)measures your heart’s electrical activity using electrodes (small, sticky patches) on your skin.an ecg can detect abnormal heart rhythms, which may be a sign of conditions likeatrial fibrillation (where your heart beats irregularly).a carotidultrasound scancan show if there’s narrowing or blockages in the neck arteries leading to your brain.a small probe (transducer) sends high-frequency sound waves into your body. when these sound waves bounce back, they create an image of the inside of your body.brain scans are not always necessary if you’ve had a tia.you might have amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan. this scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create an image of your brain.you might have acomputerised tomography (ct) scanif an mri scan is not suitable for you. this type of scan uses a series of x-rays to produce an image of the inside of brain.although the symptoms of a tia stop on their own, you’ll need treatment to help reduce the risk of another tia or a fullstroke.appropriate treatment following a tia can help to reduce your risk of having one.your doctor will tell you about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your stroke risk. your doctor will prescribe medication to treat the underlying cause of your tia. you might need surgery as part of your treatment.there are lifestyle changes you can make that may help reduce your chances of having a stroke after a tia like: eating a healthy diet– a low-fat, low-salt, high-fibre diet is usually recommended, with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains exercising regularly– this can help lower your cholesterol level and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level stopping smokingif you smoke cutting down on the amount of alcoholyou drinkmost people who’ve had a tia will take medication to reduce their chances of having a stroke or another tia.after a tia, the aim is to reduce the risk of a stroke especially in the first few days. to do this a combination of treatments is usually recommended. some of the treatments might include: antiplatelets likeaspirinandclopidogrel anticoagulants like apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or warfarin medication to lower your blood pressure (antihypertensives) statinsto lower your cholesterolthe antiplatelet medications need to be taken immediately. others may only be started later and usually need to be taken long term.a carotid endarterectomy is an operation to remove part of the lining of the carotid artery and

       " 'Trigeminal neuralgia': 'trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, severe facial pain, described as sharp, shooting or like an electric shock.it usually occurs in sudden short attacks lasting from a few seconds to about two minutes, which stop just as abruptly.in the vast majority of cases it affects part or all of one side of the face, with the pain most commonly felt in the lower part of the face. very occasionally it affects both sides of the face, but not normally at the same time.people with the condition may experience attacks of pain regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day.it’s possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (known as a period of remission), although these periods of remission tend to get shorter with time. some people may then go on to develop a more continuous aching, throbbing and burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks.typically, the attacks of pain are brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind (even a slight breeze or air conditioning) or movement of the face or head. sometimes, the pain can occur without any trigger whatsoever.living with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult and it can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression.read more about thesymptoms of trigeminal neuralgiayou should see your gp if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such asparacetamolandibuprofendo not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.your gp will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain.however, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult, and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed.read more aboutdiagnosing trigeminal neuralgiain the vast majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. this is the largest nerve inside the skull, which transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain.this compression is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull.in rare cases, trigeminal neuralgia can occur as a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve, caused by an underlying condition such asmultiple sclerosis (ms)or a tumour.read more about thecauses of trigeminal neuralgiait’s not clear exactly how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but the condition is thought to be rare.some studies have suggested that around 27 in every 100,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the uk each year, although this figure is probably too high as the condition tends to be over-diagnosed by doctors. other estimates have suggested that there are about 6,500 new cases diagnosed each year in the uk.the condition affects women more often than men and is rare in people under the age of 40, although it can occur in younger people. most cases are first seen in people between the ages of 50 and 60.trigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition, and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. however, most cases can be controlled to at least some degree with treatment.the first treatment offered will usually be with an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treatepilepsy) called carbamazepine. to be effective, this medication needs to be taken several times a day, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so that high enough levels of the medication can build up in your bloodstream.unless your pain starts to diminish or disappears altogether, the medication is usually continued for as long as is necessary, sometimes for many years. if you are entering a period of remission and your pain goes away, stopping the medication should always be done slowly over days or weeks, unless you are advised otherwise by a doctor.carbamazepine was not originally designed to treat pain, but it can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages.if this medication is ineffective, unsuitable or causes too many side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medications or surgical procedures that may help.there are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia – usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals – but these are generally only effective for a few years.alternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open up your skull and move away any blood vessels compressing the trigeminal nerve. research suggests this operation offers the best results in terms of long-term pain relief, but it is a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such ashearing loss, facial numbness or, very rarely, astroke.read more abouttreating trigeminal neuralgiathe main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes.the pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. the attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees.trigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. in rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. the pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye.you may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly.after the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. there may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks.you may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. it is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as “remission”). however, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission.attacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by certain actions or movements, such as: talking smiling chewing brushing your teeth washing your face a light touch shaving or putting on make-up swallowing kissing a cool breeze or air conditioning head movements vibrations, such as walking or a car journeyhowever, pain can occur spontaneously with no triggers whatsoever.living with trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely difficult, and your quality of life can be significantly affected.you may feel like avoiding activities such as washing, shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain, and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities. however, it’s important to try to live a normal life, and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse.the emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems, such asdepression. during periods of extreme pain, some people may even considersuicide. even when pain-free, you may live in fear of the pain returning.you should see your gp if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such asparacetamolandibuprofendo not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.your gp will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. trigeminal neuralgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose, so it’s important to try to describe your symptoms as accurately and in as much detail as possible.read more aboutdiagnosing trigeminal neuralgiaalthough the exact cause is not known, trigeminal neuralgia is often thought to be caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve or an underlying condition affecting this nerve.the trigeminal nerve (also called the fifth cranial nerve) is the largest nerve inside the skull. you have two trigeminal nerves, one in each side of your face. small branches from different parts of the face join into three major nerve branches. these are: the upper branch (ophthalmic) – which carries sensory information from the skin above the eye, forehead and front of the head the middle branch (maxillary) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the cheek, side of the nose, upper jaw, teeth and gums the lower branch (mandibular) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the lower jaw, teeth and gumsthese branches enter the skull through three different routes and then join together in what is called the gasserian ganglion, before connecting to the brainstem in the part of the skull called the posterior fossa.trigeminal neuralgia can involve one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. the maxillary and mandibular branches are affected most often, and the ophthalmic branch is the least commonly affected.evidence suggests that in up to 95% of cases, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is pressure on the trigeminal nerve close to where it enters the brain stem (the lowest part of the brain that merges with the spinal cord), past the gasserian ganglion.in most cases, this pressure seems to be caused by an artery or vein compressing the trigeminal nerve, although it’s not known why this happens.it’s also not clear exactly why this pressure can cause painful attacks, as not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve will experience pain. it may be that, in some people, the pressure on the nerve wears away its protective outer layer called the myelin sheath, which may cause uncontrollable pain signals to travel along the nerve.however, this does not fully explain why periods of remission (periods without symptoms) can occur and why pain relief is immediate after a successful operation to move the blood vessels away from the nerve.other reasons why the trigeminal nerve can become compressed or damaged include: a tumour (a growth or lump) a cyst (fluid-filled sac) arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins) multiple sclerosis (ms)– a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)as the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia is often felt in the jaw, teeth or gums, it is common for people to visit their dentist initially, rather than their gp.if you visit your dentist, they will ask you questions about your symptoms and investigate your facial pain using a dentalx-rayand other means to look for other more common causes, such as a dental infection or cracked tooth.if the dentist cannot find a cause, it is important not to undergo unnecessary treatment such as a root canal filling or an extraction, even though you may be convinced that it is a tooth problem. if your dentist can’t find anything wrong, do not try to persuade them to remove a particular tooth, as this will not solve the problem.often, the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is made by a dentist, but if you have already seen your dentist and they have not been able to find an obvious cause of your pain, visit your gp.there is no specific test for trigeminal neuralgia, so a diagnosis is largely based on your symptoms and your description of the pain.if you have experienced facial pain, your gp will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as how often they occur, how long the pain attacks last and which areas of your face are affected. the more details about your pain you can provide, the better.your gp will consider other possible causes of your pain and may also examine your head and jaw to identify which parts are painful.an important part of the process of diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia involves ruling out other conditions that can also cause facial pain.by asking about your symptoms and carrying out an examination, your gp may be able to rule out other conditions, such as: migraine joint pain in the lower jaw giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) – a condition in which medium and large arteries in the head and neck become inflamed and cause pain in the jaw and temples a possible injury to one of the facial nervesyour medical, personal and family history will also need to be taken into consideration when determining possible causes of your pain.for example, trigeminal neuralgia is less likely if you are under 40 years old, andmultiple sclerosis (ms)may be more likely if you have a family history of the condition or if you have some other form of this condition. however, trigeminal neuralgia is very unlikely to be the first symptom of ms.if your gp is not sure about your diagnosis, or if you have unusual symptoms, they may refer you for amagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanof your head.an mri scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of your head. it can help identify potential causes of your facial pain, such assinusitis(inflammation of the lining of the sinuses), tumours on one of the facial nerves, or nerve damage caused by ms.an mri can also sometimes detect whether a blood vessel in your head is compressing one of the trigeminal nerves, which is one of the maincauses of trigeminal neuralgia. however, highly sophisticated mri scans may be needed to show this accurately, although this may not necessarily be helpful, because not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve has trigeminal neuralgia.there are a number of treatments available that can offer some relief from the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia.identifying triggers and avoiding them can also help.most people with trigeminal neuralgia will be prescribed medication to help control their pain, although surgery may be considered for the longer term in those cases where medication is ineffective or causes too many side effects.the painful attacks associated with trigeminal neuralgia can sometimes be triggered or made worse by a number of different things. therefore, in addition to your medical treatment, it may help to try to avoid these triggers, if possible.for example, if your pain is triggered by wind or even a draught in a room, it may help to avoid sitting near open windows or the source of air conditioning, and wearing a scarf wrapped around your face in windy weather. a transparent dome-shaped umbrella can also protect your face from the weather.hot, spicy or cold food or drink may also trigger your pain, so avoiding these can help. using a straw to drink warm or cold drinks may also help prevent the liquid coming into contact with the painful areas of your mouth. it is important to eat nourishing meals, however, so if you are having difficulty chewing, consider eating mushy foods or liquidising your meals.certain foods seem to trigger attacks in some people, so you may want to consider avoiding things such as caffeine, citrus fruits and bananas.as normal painkillers such asparacetamolare not effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia, you will normally be prescribed an alternative medication, such as an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treatepilepsy) to help control your pain.these medications were not originally designed to treat pain, but they can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain.they need to be taken regularly, not just when the pain attacks occur, but can be stopped when the episodes of pain cease and you are in remission.  unless otherwise instructed by your gp or specialist, it is important to build up the dosage slowly and reduce it again gradually over a few weeks. taking too much too soon and stopping the medication too quickly can cause serious problems.initially, your gp will probably prescribe a type of anticonvulsant called carbamazepine, although a number of alternatives are available if this is ineffective or unsuitable.the anticonvulsant carbamazepine is currently the only medication licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in the uk. it can be very effective initially, but may become less effective over time.you will usually need to take this medicine at a low dose once or twice a day, with the dose slowly increasing up to four times a day until it provides satisfactory pain relief.carbamazepine often causes side effects, which may make it difficult for some people to take. these include: tiredness and sleepiness dizziness (lightheadedness) difficulty concentrating and memory problems confusion feeling unsteady on your feet feeling sick and vomiting double vision a reduced number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leukopenia) allergic skin reactions, such as urticaria (hives)you should speak to your gp if you experience any persistent or troublesome side effects while you are taking carbamazepine, especially allergic skin reactions, as these could be dangerous.carbamazepine has also been linked to a number of less common but more serious side effects, including thoughts ofself-harmorsuicide. you should immediately report any suicidal feelings to your gp. if this is not possible, call the nhs 24111service.carbamazepine may stop working over time. if this occurs, or if you experience significant side effects while taking it, you should be referred to a specialist to consider alternative medications or procedures.there are a number of specialists you may be referred to for further treatment, including neurologists specialising in headaches, neurosurgeons and pain medicine specialists (for example, at a pain clinic).in addition to carbamazepine, there are a number of other medications that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, including: oxcarbazepine lamotrigine gabapentin pregabalin baclofennone of these medications are specifically licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, which means they have not undergone rigorous clinical trials to determine whether they are effective and safe to treat the condition.however, this is largely only because trigeminal neuralgia is a rare condition, and clinical trials are difficult to carry out on such a painful condition because giving some people an inactive, “dummy” medication (placebo) to compare these medications to would be unethical and impractical.however, many specialists will prescribe an unlicensed medication if they think it is likely to be effective and the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks.if your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication to treat trigeminal neuralgia, they should inform you that it is unlicensed and discuss possible risks and benefits with you.with most of these medications, the side effects can be quite difficult to cope with initially. not everyone experiences side effects, but if you do, try to persevere because they do tend to diminish with time or at least until the next dosage increase, when you may find a further period of adjustment is necessary. talk to your gp if you are finding the side effects unbearable.if medication does not adequately control your symptoms or is causing persistently troublesome side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss the different surgical and non-surgical options available to relieve your pain.there a number of procedures that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, so you will need to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment with your specialist before making a decision. it is wise to be as informed as possible and to make the choice that it right for you as an individual.there is no guarantee that one or any of these procedures will work for you but, once you have had a successful procedure, you won’t need to take your pain medications unless the pain returns. if one procedure does not work, you can always try another or remain on your medication temporarily or permanently.some of the procedures that can be used to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia are outlined below.there are a number of procedures that can offer some relief from trigeminal neuralgia pain, at least temporarily, by inserting a needle or thin tube through the cheek and into the trigeminal nerve inside the skull.these are known can “percutaneous” (through the skin) procedures, and they are carried out usingx-raysto guide the needle or tube into the correct place while you are heavily sedated with medication or under ageneral anaesthetic(where you are asleep).percutaneous procedures that can be carried out to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia include: glycerol injections – where a medication called glycerol in injected around the gasserian ganglion (where the three main branches of the trigeminal nerve join together) radiofrequency lesioning – where a needle is used to apply heat directly to the the gasserian ganglion balloon compression – where a tiny balloon is passed along a thin tube inserted through the cheek and is inflated around the gasserian ganglion to squeeze it; the balloon is then removedthese procedures work by deliberately injuring or damaging the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to disrupt the pain signals travelling along it. you are usually able to go home the same day, following your treatment.overall, all of these procedures are similarly effective in relieving trigeminal neuralgia pain, although there can be complications with each, and these vary with the procedure and the individual. the pain relief will usually only last a few years, and sometimes only a few months. sometimes these procedures do not work at all.the major side effect of these procedures is numbness of part or all the side of the face, and this can vary in severity from being very numb or just pins and needles. the sensation, which can be permanent, is often similar to that following an injection at the dentist. very rarely, you can get a combination of numbness and continuous pain called anesthesia dolorosa, which is virtually untreatable.the procedures also carry a risk of other short- and long-term side effects and complications, including bleeding, facial bruising, eye problems and problems moving the facial muscles.an alternative way to relieve pain by damaging the trigeminal nerve that doesn’t involve inserting anything through the skin is stereotactic radiosurgery. this is a fairly new treatment that uses a concentrated beam of radiation to deliberately damage the trigeminal nerve where it enters the brainstem.stereotactic radiosurgery does not require a general anaesthetic and no cuts (incisions) are made in your cheek.a metal frame is attached to your head with four pins inserted around your scalp (alocal anaestheticis used to numb the areas where these are inserted) and your head, complete with the frame attached, is held in a large machine for an hour or two (which may make you feel claustrophobic) while the radiation is given. the frame and pins are then removed, and you are able to go home after a short rest.it can take a few weeks – or sometimes many months – for this procedure to take effect, but it can offer pain relief for some people for several months or years. studies into this treatment have shown similar results to the other procedures mentioned above.the most common complications associated with stereotactic radiosurgery include facial numbness and pins and needles (paraesthesia) in the face. this can be permanent and, in some cases, very troublesome.microvascular decompression (mvd) is an operation that can help relieve trigeminal neuralgia pain without intentionally damaging the trigeminal nerve. instead, the procedure involves relieving the pressure placed on the nerve by blood vessels that are touching the nerve or wrapped around it.this is a major procedure that involves opening up the skull, and is carried out under general anaesthetic by a neurosurgeon.during mvd, the surgeon will make an incision in your scalp, behind your ear, and remove a small circular piece of skull bone. they will then either remove or relocate the blood vessel(s), separating them from the trigeminal nerve using an artificial pad or a sling constructed from adjoining tissue.for many people, this type of surgery is effective in easing or completely stopping the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. it provides the longest lasting relief, with some studies suggesting that pain only recurs in about 30% of cases within 10-20 years of surgery.  currently, this is the closest possible cure for trigeminal neuralgia.however, it’s an invasive procedure and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as facial numbness, hearing loss,strokeand even death (in around 1 in every 200 cases).living with a long-term and painful condition such as trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult.you may find it useful to contact local or national support groups, such as thetrigeminal neuralgia association uk, for more information and advice about living with the condition, and to get in touch with other people who have the condition to talk to them about their experiences.research has shown that groups that have support from health care professionals provide high-quality help, which can significantly improve your ability to manage this rare condition. learning from others how to cope can help remove the fear of more pain and reduce the risk of depression.however, you need to be wary of potentially unreliable information you may find elsewhere, especially if offering “cures” for the condition. there is a great deal of misinformation on the internet, so do your research only on reliable websites, not on open forums or on social media.there are a number of research projects running both in the uk and abroad to determine the cause of this condition and to find new treatments, including new medications, so there is always hope on the horizon. trigeminal neuralgia assocation uk brain and spine foundation: trigeminal neuralgia nice: trigeminal neuralgia',\n",
       " 'Tuberculosis (TB)': 'audio|british sign language (bsl)tuberculosis (tb) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.it is a serious condition, but can be cured with proper treatment.tb mainly affects the lungs. however, it can affect any part of the body, including the glands, bones and nervous system.typical symptoms of tb include: a persistentcoughthat lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody weight loss night sweats high temperature (fever) tiredness and fatigue loss of appetite new swellings that haven’t gone away after a few weeksyou should see a gp if you have a cough that lasts more than three weeks or if you cough up blood.read more about thesymptoms of tbanddiagnosing tbtb is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis.tb that affects the lungs is the most contagious type, but it usually only spreads after prolonged exposure to someone with the illness. for example, it often spreads within a family who live in the same house.in most healthy people, the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) kills the bacteria, and you have no symptoms.sometimes the immune system cannot kill the bacteria, but manages to prevent it spreading in the body. this means you will not have any symptoms, but the bacteria will remain in your body. this is known as ‘latent tb’.if the immune system fails to kill or contain the infection, it can spread within the lungs or other parts of the body and symptoms will develop within a few weeks or months. this is known as ‘active tb’.latent tb could develop into an active tb infection at a later date, particularly if your immune system becomes weakened.read more about thecauses of tbbefore antibiotics were introduced, tb was a major health problem in the uk. nowadays, the condition is much less common.however, in the last 20 years, tb cases have gradually increased, particularly among ethnic minority communities who are originally from countries where tb is more common.it’s estimated that around one-third of the world’s population is infected with latent tb. of these, up to 10% will become active at some point.with treatment, tb can usually be cured. most people will need a course of antibiotics, usually for 6 months.several different antibiotics are used. this is because some forms of tb are resistant to certain antibiotics. if you are infected with a drug-resistant form of tb, treatment with 6 or more different medications may be needed.if you are in close contact with someone who has tb, tests may be carried out to see if you are also infected. these can include a chestx-ray,blood tests, and a skin test called the mantoux test.read more abouttreating tbthebcg vaccinecan provide effective protection against tb in up to 8 out of 10 people who are given it.currently, bcg vaccinations are only recommended for groups of people who are at a higher risk of developing tb.this includes children living in areas with high rates of tb, or those who have close family members from countries with high tb rates, and people under the age of 16 who are going to live and work with local people in an area with high rates of tb for more than three months.it’s also recommended that some people, such as healthcare workers, are vaccinated because of the increased risk of contracting tb while working.the symptoms of tuberculosis (tb) depend on where the infection occurs.tb usually develops slowly. your symptoms might not begin until months or even years after you were initially infected.in some cases the infection doesn’t cause any symptoms, which is known as latent tb. it’s called active tb if you have symptoms. you should contact your gp if you or your child have symptoms of tb.read about thecauses of tuberculosisfor more information about latent and active tb.general symptoms of tb include: lack of appetite and weight loss a high temperature (fever) night sweats extreme tiredness or fatiguethese symptoms can have many different causes, however, and are not always a sign of tb.tb can also cause additional symptoms depending on which part of the body is infected.most infections affect the lungs, which can cause: a persistentcoughthat lasts more than 3 weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody breathlessnessthat gradually gets worsethis is known as pulmonary tb.less commonly, tb infections develop in areas outside the lungs, such as the lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system), the bones and joints, the digestive system, the bladder and reproductive system, and the nervous system (brain and nerves).this is known as extrapulmonary tb.symptoms of extrapulmonary tb vary, but can include: persistentlyswollen glands abdominal (tummy) pain pain and loss of movement in an affected bone or joint confusion a persistentheadache seizures (fits)extrapulmonary tb is more common in people with a weakened immune system, such as those withhiv.tuberculosis (tb) is caused by a type of bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis.the condition is spread when a person with an active tb infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which contain tb bacteria.although it is spread in a similar way to acoldor theflu, tb is not as contagious. you would usually have to spend prolonged periods in close contact with an infected person to catch the infection yourself.for example, tb infections usually spread between family members who live in the same house. it would be highly unlikely to become infected by sitting next to an infected person on a bus or train.not everyone with tb is infectious. generally, children with tb or people with tb that occurs outside the lungs (extrapulmonary tb) do not spread the infection.in most healthy people the immune system is able to destroy the bacteria that cause tb. however, in some cases the bacteria infect the body but don’t cause any symptoms (latent tb), or the infection begins to cause symptoms within weeks or months (active tb).up to 10% of people with latent tb eventually develop active tb years after the initial infection. this usually happens when the immune system is weakened – for example, duringchemotherapy.anyone can catch tb, but people particularly at risk include those: who live in, come from, or have spent time in a country or area with high levels of tb – around 3 in every 4 tb cases in the uk affect people born outside the uk in prolonged close contact with someone who is infected living in crowded conditions with a condition that weakens their immune system, such ashiv having treatments that weaken the immune system, such ascorticosteroids, chemotherapy or tumour necrosis factor (tnf) inhibitors (used to treat some types ofarthritisand certain gut conditions) who are very young or very old – the immune systems of people who are young or elderly tend to be weaker than those of healthy adults in poor health or with a poor diet because of lifestyle and other problems, such as drug misuse,alcohol misuse, or homelessnessseveral tests are used to diagnose tuberculosis (tb), depending on the type of tb suspected.your gp may refer you to a tb specialist for testing and treatment if they think you have tb.a diagnosis of pulmonary tb (tb that affects the lungs) can be difficult and several tests are usually needed.this will include a chestx-rayto look for changes in the appearance of your lungs that are suggestive of tb. samples of phlegm will also often be taken and checked for the presence of tb bacteria.these tests are important in helping to decide on the most effective treatment for you.if you have suspected extrapulmonary tb (tb that occurs outside the lungs), several tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis. these may include: acomputerised tomography (ct) scan,magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan, orultrasound scanof the affected part of the body examining the inside of your body with a long, thin, flexible tube that contains a light and camera, which is inserted either through an opening such as your mouth (endoscopy) or a small cut made in your skin (laparoscopy) urine andblood tests abiopsy– a small sample of tissue or fluid is taken from the affected area and tested for tb bacteriayou may also have a lumbar puncture. this involves taking a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) from the base of your spine. csf is fluid that surrounds the brain. it can be checked to see whether tb has infected your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).in some circumstances, you may need to be tested to check for latent tb (when you have been infected with tb bacteria, but do not have any symptoms).for example, you may need to be screened if you have been in close contact with someone known to have an active tb infection (an infection that causes symptoms), or if you have recently spent time in a country where tb levels are high.if you have just moved to the uk from a country where tb is common, you may be screened when you arrive or your gp may suggest screening when you register as a patient.the mantoux test is a widely used test for latent tb. it involves injecting a substance called ppd tuberculin into the skin of your forearm. it’s also called the tuberculin skin test (tst).if you have a latent tb infection, your skin will be sensitive to ppd tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test. if you have a very strong skin reaction, you may need a chest x-ray to confirm whether you have an active tb infection.if you do not have a latent infection, your skin will not react to the mantoux test. however, as tb can take a long time to develop, you may need to be screened again at a later stage.if you have had the bcg vaccination, you may have a mild skin reaction to the mantoux test. this does not necessarily mean you have latent tb.the igra is a newer type of blood test for tb that is becoming more widely available.the igra may be used to help diagnose latent tb: if you have a positive mantoux test if you previously had the bcg vaccination (as the mantoux test may not be reliable in these cases) as part of your tb screening if you have just moved to the uk from a country where tb is common as part of a health check when you register with a gp if you are about to have treatment that will suppress your immune system if you are a healthcare workertreatment for tuberculosis (tb) will usually involve a long course ofantibioticslasting several months.while tb is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, deaths are rare if treatment is completed.for most people, a hospital admission during treatment is not necessary.if you’re diagnosed with active pulmonary tb (tb that affects your lungs and causes symptoms), you will be given a 6-month course of a combination of antibiotics. the usual course of treatment is: 2 antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for 6 months 2 additional antibiotics (pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for the first 2 monthsit may be several weeks or months before you start to feel better. the exact length of time will depend on your overall health and the severity of your tb.after taking the medicine for 2 weeks, most people are no longer infectious and feel better. however, it is important to continue taking your medicine exactly as prescribed and to complete the whole course of antibiotics.taking medication for 6 months is the most effective method of ensuring the tb bacteria are killed. if you stop taking your antibiotics before you complete the course, or you skip a dose, the tb infection may become resistant to the antibiotics. this is potentially serious, as it can be difficult to treat and will require a longer course of treatment.if you find it difficult to take your medication every day, your treatment team can work with you to find a solution. this may include having regular contact with your treatment team at home, the treatment clinic, or somewhere else that is more convenient.if treatment is completed correctly, you should not need any further checks by a tb specialist afterwards. however, you may be given advice about spotting signs that the illness has returned, although this is rare.in rare cases tb can be fatal, even with treatment. death can occur if the lungs become too damaged to work properly.extrapulmonary tb (tb that occurs outside the lungs) can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary tb. however, you may need to take them for 12 months.if you have tb in areas such as your brain or the sac surrounding your heart (pericardium), you may initially be prescribed acorticosteroidsuch as prednisolone for several weeks to take at the same time as your antibiotics. this will help to reduce any swelling in the affected areas.as with pulmonary tb, it’s important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and to finish the whole course.latent tb is when you have been infected with the tb bacteria, but do not have any symptoms of active disease. treatment for latent tb is usually recommended for anyone aged 65 or under.however, the antibiotics used to treat tb can cause liver damage in older adults, so treatment for people with latent tb aged 35 to 65 isn’t recommended if this is a concern.latent tb is also not always treated if it’s thought to be drug-resistant. if this is the case, you may be regularly monitored to check the infection does not become active.in some cases, testing and treatment for latent tb may be recommended for people who require treatment that will weaken their immune system, such as long-term corticosteroids,chemotherapyor tnf inhibitors. this is because there is a risk of the infection becoming active.treatment for latent tb generally involves either taking a combination of rifampicin and isoniazid for 3 months, or isoniazid on its own for 6 months.isoniazid can cause nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), but you’ll be given supplements of

       " 'Type 1 diabetes': 'diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.the hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood.there are two main types of diabetes: type 1 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce any insulin type 2 – where the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don’t react to insulinthis topic is about type 1 diabetes.read more abouttype 2 diabetesanother type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth.it’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.you should therefore visit your gp if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and losing weight unexpectedly (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms).type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. around 10% of all diabetes is type 1.in type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) progressively reduces the amount of insulin (the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels) it produces until it stops producing any at all.if the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body’s organs.the symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose is high but isn’t used by your muscles as fuel for energy.when blood glucose is high, glucose is lost in your urine and you may become dehydrated.typical symptoms include: feeling verythirsty passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired all the time weight loss and loss of muscle bulk persistent infections such as thrushthe symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few hours or days). in adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few days or weeks).read more about thesymptoms of type 1 diabetestype 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them.without insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. this can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. this is when the bloodstream becomes acidic, you develop dangerous levels of ketones in your blood stream and become severelydehydrated.this results in the body being unable to produce insulin, which is required to move glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. this is called type 1 diabetes.read more about thecauses of type 1 diabetesit’s important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible. if left untreated, type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. it’s essential that treatment is started early.diabetes can’t be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life.if you’re diagnosed with diabetes, you’ll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.as your body can’t produce insulin, you’ll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. you’ll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.insulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. you’ll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.insulin is given to some patients by a continuous infusion of fast (rapid) acting insulin (pump therapy). this is where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a plastic tube (cannula) that’s inserted under the skin with a needle.there are alternatives to insulin injections and pumps, but they’re only suitable for a small number of patients. they are: islet cell transplantation – where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes a complete pancreas transplant – this is still relatively rare and only a few centres of excellence offer this.read more aboutdiagnosing diabetesandtreating type 1 diabetesif diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.having a consistently raised glucose level that doesn’t cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.there is also complications that can arise if your insulin is not balanced with your food intake and exercise. your diabetes team will work with you to manage your insulin correctly.read more about thecomplications of type 1 diabetesif you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to look after your health very carefully. caring for your health will also make treating your diabetes easier and minimise your risk of developing complications.for example, eating ahealthy, balanced dietandexercising regularlywill lower your blood glucose level.stopping smoking(if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developingcardiovascular disease.your healthcare team will discuss this with you, and you can see your own results throughmy diabetes my way. it’s important that you learn the skills to self manage your diabetes and there are people to help and support you to do this.if you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it’s not treated. everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year.read more aboutliving with type 1 diabetesthe symptoms of type 1 diabetes should disappear when you start taking insulin and you get the condition under control.the main symptoms of diabetes are: feeling verythirsty urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush (a yeast infection) blurred vision caused by the lens of your eye changing shapevomiting or heavy, deep breathing can also occur at a later stage. this is a dangerous sign and requires immediate admission to hospital for treatment.you should seek urgent medical attention if you have diabetes and develop: a loss of appetite nausea or vomiting a high temperature stomach pain fruity smelling breath – which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish (some people can smell this themselves)if you have diabetes, your blood glucose levels can become very low. this is known ashypoglycaemia(or a “hypo”).in most cases, hypoglycaemia occurs as a result of taking too much insulin, although it can also develop if you skip a meal, exercise very vigorously or drink alcohol on an empty stomach.symptoms of a “hypo” include: feeling shaky and irritable sweating tingling lips feeling weak feeling confused hunger nausea (feeling sick)a hypo can be brought under control simply by eating or drinking something sugary.if it isn’t brought under control, a hypo can cause confusion, slurred speech and, eventually, unconsciousness.in this case, an emergency injection of a hormone called glucagon will be needed. glucagon increases the glucose in your blood. your diabetes team will advise you in more detail about avoiding, recognising and treating a hypo.as diabetes occurs as a result of your body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. this happens because there’s insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy.if your blood glucose levels become too high, you may experience hyperglycaemia. the symptoms of hyperglycaemia are similar to the main symptoms of diabetes, but they may come on suddenly and be more severe. they include: extreme thirst a dry mouth blurred vision drowsiness a need to pass urine frequentlyleft untreated or if you already have an infection, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. this is a life-threatening condition, where the body breaks down fat and muscle as an alternative source of energy. this leads to a build-up of acids in your blood, which can cause vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness and even death.your healthcare team will teach you about looking out for these symptoms and how to manage your‘sick day’ rules.the diabetes uk website has more information abouttype 1 diabetes symptoms.type 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin. insulin is a hormone that’s needed to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood.when you eat, your digestive system breaks down food and passes its nutrients – including glucose – into your bloodstream.the pancreas (a small gland behind your stomach) usually produces insulin, which transfers any glucose out of your blood and into your cells, where it’s converted to energy.however, if you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas is unable to produce any insulin (see below). this means that glucose can’t be moved out of your bloodstream and into your cells.type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. your immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them, destroying them completely or damaging them enough to stop them producing insulin.it’s not known exactly what triggers the immune system to do this, but some researchers have suggested that it may be due to a viral infection.type 1 diabetes is often inherited (runs in families), so the autoimmune reaction may also be genetic.if you have a close relative – such as a parent, brother or sister – with type 1 diabetes, you have about a 6% chance of also developing the condition. the risk for people who don’t have a close relative with type 1 diabetes is just under 0.5%.read aboutdiagnosing type 1 diabetesif you experience thesymptoms of diabetes, you should visit your gp as soon as possible. they’ll ask about your symptoms and may request a urine and blood test.your urine sample will be tested to see whether it contains glucose. urine doesn’t usually contain glucose, but if you have diabetes, some glucose can overflow through the kidneys and into the urine. your urine may also be tested for ketones (chemicals) that indicate type 1 diabetes.the gp may do a finger prick blood test for glucose and ketones. a sample will be sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. these results will be discussed with the specialist diabetes service if there is concern you have type 1 diabetes.the glycated haemoglobin (hba1c) test is another blood test that can be used to diagnose diabetes.nd to monitor our long-term diabetes control.in people who’ve already been diagnosed with diabetes, the hba1c test is often used to show how well their diabetes is being controlled.the hba1c test gives your average blood glucose level over the previous two to three months. the results can indicate whether the measures you’re taking to control your diabetes are working.if you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes, it’s recommended that you have your hba1c measured at least twice a year. however, you may need to have your hba1c measured more frequently if: you’ve recently been diagnosed with diabetes your blood glucose remains too high your treatment plan has been changed you’re planning a pregnancyunlike other tests, the hba1c test can be carried out at any time of day and doesn’t require any special preparation, such as fasting. however, it’s less reliable in certain situations, such as during pregnancy.the advantages associated with the hba1c test make it the preferred method of assessing how well blood glucose levels are being controlled in a person with diabetes.read abouttreating type 1 diabetesan important part of your treatment is to make sure that your blood glucose level is as normal and stable as possible.you’ll be able to manage this using insulin treatment and by eating ahealthy, balanced diet, but you will also have to regularly check your blood glucose levels to make sure they’re not too high or too low.exercise, illness, stress, drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, changes to your hormone levels during your monthly period can all affect your blood glucose levels.in most cases, you’ll need to check your blood glucose levels during the day, both at home and at work or school, using a simple finger prick blood test. you may need to do this up to four or more times a day, depending on the type of insulin treatment you’re taking. there are different methods of checking your blood glucose that doesn’t involve pricking your finger. discuss your options with your diabetes care team.the normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals. mmol/l means millimoles per litre, and it’s a way of defining the concentration of glucose in your blood.there is another method to check glucose levels without pricking your finger. this is called aflash glucose monitor(freestyle libre).the diabetes uk website has more information ontesting your glucose levels.you’ll be measuring your blood glucose yourself every day, to check your levels.your gp or diabetes care team will also carry out a different blood test every two to six months, called the hba1c test.this gives a clearer idea of how well your treatment plan is working, by measuring how stable your glucose levels have been over the past 6-12 weeks.it measures the amount of haemoglobin, which is the oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells that has glucose attached to it. a high hba1c level may indicate that your blood glucose level is consistently high and that your diabetes treatment plan needs to be altered.the ideal hba1c target for people with diabetes is below 53 mmol/mol.hypoglycaemiacan occur when your blood glucose level becomes very low. it’s likely that you’ll develop hypoglycaemia from time to time.mild hypoglycaemia (or a “hypo”) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, and can be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary, such as: 200ml pure fruit juice 5 to 7 dextrose tablets 4 to 5 glucotabs 60ml glucojuice 5 jelly babiesyou may also be able to take pure glucose, in the form of a tablet or fluid, if you need to control the symptoms of a hypo quickly.if you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you can become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. if this occurs, you’ll need assistance from another person who may be able to give you a glucose gel rubbed into your cheeks or an injection of glucagon into your muscle. glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.your diabetes care team may show several of your family members and close friends how to inject glucagon or give you glucose gel, should you need it.once you begin to come round, you’ll need to eat something sugary when you’re alert enough to do so. if you lose consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia, there’s a risk that it could happen again within a few hours. you’ll need to rest afterwards and have someone with you to ensure that you eat some food to replace the glucose stores in your body.if the glucagon injection into your muscle doesn’t work, and you’re still drowsy or unconscious 10 minutes after the injection, you’ll need urgent medical attention.you’ll need to have an injection of dextrose straight into a vein, which must be given by a trained healthcare professional.if you have type 1 diabetes, it’s recommended that you carry identification with you so that people are aware of the problem if you become hypoglycaemic.if significant hypoglycaemia is a regular problem or you have lost your awareness of hypoglycaemia your health care team may consider using acontinuous glucose monitor (cgm).some people with type 1 diabetes may benefit from a fairly new procedure known as islet cell transplantation. it involves implanting healthy islet cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes.in 2008, a government-funded islet cell transplant programme was introduced, and the procedure is now available through the nhs for people who satisfy certain criteria (see below).you may be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you’ve had: two or more severe hypos within the last two years and you have a poor awareness of hypoglycaemia a working kidney transplant, severe hypos and poor hypoglycaemia awareness, or poor blood glucose control even after receiving the best medical treatmentyou may not be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you: weigh over 85kg (13st 5.4lb) have poor kidney function need a lot of insulin – for example, over 50 units a day for a 70kg (11st) personan islet cell transplant is a minor, low-risk procedure that’s carried out under local anaesthetic.the procedure has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of severe hypos. so far, the results of islet cell transplants carried out in the uk have shown a significant reduction in the number of hypos, from 23 per person per year before transplantation to less than one per person per year afterwards.people with type 1 diabetes who are having a kidney transplant from a donor may also be offered a pancreas transplant at the same time.others may be offered a pancreas transplant after they’ve had a kidney transplant because they’re already on anti-rejection tablets.if you’re having repeated, severe and life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks, a pancreas transplant may also be recommended.during the procedure, your faulty pancreas will be replaced with a healthy pancreas from a donor. this will allow you to get a new source of insulin.pancreas transplants are complicated operations and, like other types of major surgery, there’s a risk of complications. in the uk, about 200 pancreas transplants are carried out each year, with more than 300 people on the waiting list.the waiting time for a pancreas transplant is one to two years, because there’s a shortage of suitable donor organs.hyperglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose levels become too high. it can happen for several reasons, such as eating too much, being unwell or not taking enough insulin.if you develop hyperglycaemia, you may need to adjust your diet or your insulin dose to keep your glucose levels normal. your diabetes care team can advise you about the best way to do this.if hyperglycaemia isn’t treated, it can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of glucose, resulting in a build-up of ketones (acids) in your blood.diabetic ketoacidosis is very serious and, if not addressed quickly, it can lead to unconsciousness and, eventually, death.the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include: frequently passing urine thirst tiredness and lethargy (lack of energy) blurry vision abdominal (stomach) pain nausea and vomiting deep breathing smell of ketones on breath (described as smelling like pear drops) collapse and unconsciousnessread more about thesymptoms of diabetic ketoacidosisyour healthcare team will educate you on how to decrease your risk of ketoacidosis by testing your own blood for ketones using blood ketone sticks if you’re unwell.if you develop diabetic ketoacidosis, you’ll need urgent hospital treatment. you’ll be given insulin directly into a vein (intravenously). you may also need other fluids given by a drip if you’re dehydrated, including salt solution and potassium.type 1 diabetes can lead to long-term complications. if you have the condition, you have an increased risk of developingheart disease,stroke, eye andkidney disease. to reduce the chance of this, you may be advised to take: anti-hypertensive medicines to controlhigh blood pressure a statin – such as simvastatin – to reducehigh cholesterol levels low-dose aspirinto prevent stroke angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor – such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney diseasediabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of a protein called albumin in your urine. it’s often reversible if treated early enough.the aim of treating diabetes is to help people with the condition control their blood glucose levels and minimise the risk of developing future complications.in scotland there is anational diabetes improvement planproduced by the scottish diabetes group, patients and health care professionals.thediabetes national service frameworkhas also been developed by diabetes clinical experts and patients with diabetes. good diabetes care includes: access to information and appropriate support for people with type 1 diabetes, including access to a structured education programme an agreed care plan, helping all people with diabetes to manage their care and lead a healthy lifestyle – including a named contact for their care information, care and support to enable all people with diabetes to control their blood glucose, maintain an acceptable blood pressure and minimise other risk factors for developing complications access to services to identify and treat possible complications – such as screening fordiabetic retinopathy(where high blood glucose levels damage the retina at the back of the eye) and specialised foot care effective care for all people with diabetes admitted to hospital, for whatever reasonif diabetes isn’t treated, it can lead to a number of different health problems. high glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.a consistently raised glucose level that doesn’t cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.if you have diabetes, you’re up to five times more likely to developheart diseaseor have astroke.prolonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of developingatherosclerosis(furring and narrowing of your blood vessels).this may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causingangina(a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking). it also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become completely blocked, leading to aheart attackor stroke.high blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels of your nerves. this can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. if the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting,diarrhoeaorconstipation.retinopathy is where the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue) at the back of the eye is damaged. blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. this prevents the light from fully passing through to your retina. if it isn’t treated, it can damage your vision.the better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems. having an annual eye check with a specialist (an ophthalmologist or optometrist) can help pick up signs of a potentially serious eye problem early so that it can be treated.treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.if the condition hasn’t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, bp and cholesterol level is recommended.the main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are: laser treatment injections of medication into your eyes an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyesread about diabetic eye screeningif the small blood vessels in your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently.in rare, severe cases, this can lead to kidney failure and the need fordialysis(treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys). in some cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary.damage to the nerves of the foot can mean that small nicks and cuts aren’t noticed, which can lead to a foot ulcer developing. about 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause serious infection.if you develop nerve damage, you should check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist. look out for sores and cuts that don’t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. you should also have a foot examination at least once a year.in men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. this can usually be treated with medication.women with diabetes may experience: a reduced sex drive (loss of libido) reduced pleasure from sex vaginal dryness a reduced ability to orgasm pain during sexif you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication, or you find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk ofmiscarriageand stillbirth. if your blood glucose level isn’t carefully controlled immediately before and during early pregnancy, there’s also an increased risk of the baby developing a serious birth defect.pregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetes clinic. this allows doctors to keep a close eye on their blood glucose levels and control their insulin dosage more easily.read more about diabetes and pregnancy: diabetes uk my diabetes my wayhaving diabetes means that you’re more likely to develop problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes. this is because blood glucose can damage the nerves in your feet.to prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water. wear shoes that fit properly and see a podiatrist or chiropodist (a foot care specialist) regularly so that any problems are detected early.regularly check your feet for cuts, blisters or grazes because you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged. see your gp if you have a minor foot injury that doesn’t start to heal within a few days.the diabetes uk website has more information and advice abouttaking care of your feet.if you have type 1 diabetes, you should be invited to have your your eyes screened at once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy.retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged. it can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long time (hyperglycaemia). if it isn’t treated, retinopathy can eventually cause sight loss.read more aboutdiabetic eye screeningif you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you’re ill – known as your “sick day rules”.contact your diabetes care team or gp for advice if you haven’t received these.the advice you’re given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to: keep taking your insulin – it’s very importantnotto stop treatment when you’re ill; your treatment plan may state whether you need to temporarily increase your dose test your blood glucose level more often than usual – most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day keep yourself well hydrated – make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks keep eating – eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates such as milk, soup and yoghurt if this is easier check your ketone levels if your blood glucose level is highseek advice from your diabetes care team or gp if your blood glucose or ketone level remains high after taking insulin, if: you’re not sure whether to make any changes to your treatment you develop symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis you have any other concernsif you have diabetes and you’re thinking about having a baby, it’s a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team.a planned pregnancy enables you to make sure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as possible before you get pregnant. most women with diabetes have a healthy baby.you’ll need to keep your blood glucose under tight control, particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, to reduce the risk of the baby developing serious birth defects.you should also take a higher dose of folic acid tablets. folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems. doctors now recommend that all women planning to have a baby take folic acid. women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg a day until they’re 12 weeks pregnant (only available on prescription).folic acid should be taken alongside pregnancy multivitamins that includevitamin d. insulin and metformin are safe to take during pregnancy. it’s important to review any other medications you take to ensure these are safe to take during pregnancy.you should also have your eyes checked. retinopathy (see above) affects the blood vessels in the eyes and is a risk for all people with diabetes. pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, so it’s important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant.your gp or diabetes care team can give you further advice.diabetes ukandjdrfalso provide more useful information aboutpregnancy and diabetesto help you get your pregnancy off to a healthy start.you’ll be best equipped to manage your diabetes if you’re given information and education when you’re diagnosed, and then on an ongoing basis.thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)strongly recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves.this gives people the best chance of developing the skills they need to effectively treat their condition, maintain their glucose levels at a normal level and help prevent long-term complications. it also reduces the risk of developing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels).structured patient education means there’s a planned course that: covers all aspects of diabetes is flexible in content is relevant to a person’s clinical and psychological needs is adaptable to a person’s educational and cultural backgroundthere are also several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education. ask your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide.for a parent whose child is diagnosed with a life-long condition, the job of parenting becomes even tougher.although being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes will involve coming to terms with the diagnosis, getting used to treatment and

restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it’s not as severe as you may think.you should always tell your insurer that you are diabetic as this may affect your insurance claim. only individuals who use insulin have to tell the dvla that they have diabetes. a high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. this usually has to be renewed every 3 years.additional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g group 2 hgv) so always refer to thedvla guidelines.unfortunately, some individuals do lose their driving license, most commonly due to experiencing severe hypos or being unable to recognise symptoms of a hypo (hypo unawareness).to prevent hypos whilst driving you should check your blood glucose levels before driving keep

exerciseif you already have type 2 diabetes, it may be possible to control your symptoms by making the above changes. this also minimises your risk of developing complications.read more aboutliving with type 2 diabetesthe symptoms of diabetes include feeling very thirsty, passing more urine than usual, and feeling tired all the time.the symptoms occur because some or all of the glucose stays in your blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy. your body tries to get rid of the excess glucose in your urine.the main symptoms of type 2 diabetes are: urinating more often than usual, particularly at night feeling verythirsty feeling very tired unexplained weight loss itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush (a yeast infection) cuts or wounds that heal slowly blurred vision – caused by the lens of the eye becoming drythesigns and symptoms of type 1 diabetesare usually obvious and develop very quickly, often over a few weeks.these signs and symptoms aren’t always as obvious, however, and it’s often diagnosed during a routine check-up.this is because they are often mild and develop gradually over a number of years. this means you may have type 2 diabetes for many years without realising it.early diagnosis and treatment for type 2 diabetes is very important as it may reduce your risk of developing complications later on.type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach, can’t produce enough insulin to control your blood glucose level, or when the cells in your body don’t respond properly to the insulin that is produced.this means your blood glucose levels may become very high, and is known as hyperglycaemia.hyperglycaemia can occur for several reasons, including: eating too much being unwell ineffective diabetes medication not taking enough medicationhyperglycaemia causes the main symptoms of diabetes, which include extreme thirst and frequent urination.type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin to maintain a normal blood glucose level, or the body is unable to use the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance).the pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach that produces the hormone insulin. insulin moves glucose from your blood into your cells, where it’s converted into energy.in type 2 diabetes, there are several reasons why the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin.four of the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes are: age – being over the age of 40 (over 25 for south asian people) genetics – having a close relative with the condition, such as a parent, brother or sister weight – being overweight or obese ethnicity – being of south asian, chinese, african-caribbean or black african origin, even if you were born in the ukyour risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age. this may be because people tend to gain weight and exercise less as they get older.maintaining a healthy weight by eating ahealthy, balanced dietandexercising regularlyare ways of preventing and managing diabetes.white people over the age of 40 have an increased risk of developing the condition. people of south asian, chinese, african-caribbean and black african descent have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes at a much earlier age.however, despite increasing age being a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, over recent years younger people from all ethnic groups have been developing the condition.it’s also becoming more common for children – as young as seven in some cases – to develop type 2 diabetes, mainly due to rising obesity levels.genetics is one of the main risk factors for type 2 diabetes. your risk of developing the condition is increased if you have a close relative such as a parent, brother or sister who has the condition.the closer the relative, the greater the risk. a child who has a parent with type 2 diabetes has about a one in three chance of also developing the condition.you’re more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you’re overweight or obese with a body mass index (bmi) of 30 or more.fat around your tummy (abdomen) particularly increases your risk. this is because it releases chemicals that can upset the body’s cardiovascular and metabolic systems.this increases your risk of developing a number of serious conditions, includingcoronary heart disease,strokeand some types ofcancer.measuring your waist is a quick way of assessing your diabetes risk. this is a measure of abdominalobesity, which is a particularly high-risk form of obesity.women have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their waist measures 80cm (31.5 inches) or more.asian men with a waist size of 89cm (35 inches) or more have a higher risk, as do white or black men with a waist size of 94cm (37 inches) or more.exercising regularly and reducing your body weight by about 5% could reduce your risk of getting diabetes by more than 50%.read aboutmeasuring your waist sizepeople of south asian, chinese, african-caribbean and black african origin are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.type 2 diabetes is up to six times more common in south asian communities than in the general uk population, and it’s three times more common among people of african and african-caribbean origin.people of south asian and african-caribbean origin also have an increased risk of developingcomplications of type 2 diabetes, such as heart disease, at a younger age than the rest of the population.your risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also increased if your blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes.this is sometimes called pre-diabetes, and doctors sometimes call it impaired fasting glycaemia (ifg) or impaired glucose tolerance (igt). pre-diabetes is reversible if you lose weight. discuss your options with your gp.pre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes if you don’t take preventative steps, such as making lifestyle changes. these includeeating healthily,losing weightif you’re overweight, and taking plenty ofregular exercise.women who have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy also have a greater risk of developing diabetes in later life.type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition and usually gets worse over time. making lifestyle changes, such as adjusting your diet and taking more exercise, may help you control your blood glucose levels at first, but may not be enough in the long term.you may eventually need to take medication to help control your blood glucose levels.initially, this will usually be in the form of tablets and can sometimes be a combination of more than one type of tablet. it may also include insulin or another medication that you inject.metformin is usually the first medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. it works by reducing the amount of glucose your liver releases into your bloodstream. it also makes your body’s cells more responsive to insulin.if you’re overweight, it’s also likely you’ll be prescribed metformin. unlike some other medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes, metformin shouldn’t cause additional weight gain.however, it can sometimes cause mild side effects, such as nausea anddiarrhoea, and you may not be able to take it if you have kidney damage.sglt2 inhibitors work by increasing the amount of glucose excreted in urine. they’re particularly useful in people with type 2 diabetes and who have cardiac disease.the three sglt2 inhibitors that may be prescribed include: dapagliflozin canagliflozin empagliflozineach medication is taken as a tablet once a day. the main side effect is a higher risk of genital and urinary tract infections.if you’re unwell and have a dehydrating illness (e.g. fever, vomiting or diarrhoea), it’s important you stop these medications. get your glucose and ketone level checked by your healthcare professional to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis developing.glp-1 agonists acts in a similar way to the natural hormone glp-1 (see the section on gliptins, below).they’re given by injection and boost your own insulin production when there are high blood glucose levels, reducing blood glucose without the risk of hypoglycaemia episodes (“hypos”). they’re also particularly useful for people with type 2 diabetes and cardiac disease.sulphonylureas increase the amount of insulin that’s produced by your pancreas.examples include: glibenclamide gliclazide glimepiride glipizide gliquidoneyou may be prescribed one of these medicines if you can’t take metformin.alternatively, you may be prescribed sulphonylurea and metformin if metformin doesn’t control blood glucose on its own.sulphonylureas can increase the risk ofhypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)because they increase the amount of insulin in your body. they can sometimes cause side effects, including weight gain, nausea and diarrhoea.pioglitazone is a type of thiazolidinedione medicine (tzd), which make your body’s cells more sensitive to insulin so more glucose is taken from your blood.it’s usually used in combination with other oral diabetes medication. it may cause weight gain and ankle swelling (oedema).you shouldn’t take pioglitazone if you haveheart failureor a high risk of bone fracture.gliptins work by preventing the breakdown of a naturally occurring hormone called glp-1.glp-1 helps the body produce insulin in response to high blood glucose levels, but is rapidly broken down.by preventing this breakdown, the gliptins (linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) prevent high blood glucose levels, but don’t result in episodes of hypoglycaemia.you may be prescribed a gliptin if you’re unable to take sulphonylureas or glitazones, or in combination with them. they’re not associated with weight gain and are often used with other oral diabetes medication for those who are obese.if glucose-lowering tablets aren’t effective in controlling your blood glucose levels, you may need to have insulin treatment.this can be taken instead of or alongside your tablets, depending on the dose and the way you take it.insulin comes in several different preparations, and each works slightly differently. your treatment may include a combination of these different insulin preparations.insulin must be injected because it would be broken down in your stomach like food and unable to enter your bloodstream if it were taken as a tablet.if you need to inject insulin, your diabetes care team will advise you about when you need to do it.they will show you how to inject it yourself, and will also give you advice about storing your insulin and disposing of your needles properly.insulin injections are given using either a syringe or an injection pen, also called an insulin pen (auto-injector). most people need between two and four injections of insulin a day.your gp practice or diabetes nurse will also teach a relative or a close friend how to inject the insulin properly.you can read more about insulin and how to inject it on the diabetes uk website.if you have type 2 diabetes that’s controlled using insulin or certain types of tablets (e.g. sulfonylurea), you may experience episodes ofhypoglycaemia.hypoglycaemia is where your blood glucose levels become very low.mild hypoglycaemia (a “hypo”) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, but it can usually be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary.if you have a hypo, you should initially have a form of carbohydrate that will act quickly, such as a sugary drink or glucose tablets.this should be followed by a longer-acting carbohydrate, such as a cereal bar, sandwich or piece of fruit.in most cases, these measures will be enough to raise your blood glucose level to normal. you should aim for a hypo to be treated and to recheck your blood glucose level within 15 minutes.if blood glucose still less than 4mmol/l then repeat the treatment using a fast acting carbohydrate. when your blood glucose returns to normal then have your longer acting carbohydrate.if you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you may become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness.if this occurs, you may need to have an injection of glucagon into your muscle or glucose into a vein. glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.you may require input from a health care professional. if the glucagon is not successful, you may require an injection of dextrose into your vein.your diabetes care team can advise you on how to avoid a hypo and what to do if you have one.if you have type 2 diabetes, your risk of developingheart disease,stroke, foot problems, eye andkidney diseaseis increased.to reduce your risk of developing other serious health conditions, you may be advised to take other medicines, including: anti-hypertensive medicines to controlhigh blood pressure astatin, such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, to reducehigh cholesterol low-dose aspirin to prevent astroke an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor, such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril, if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney diseasediabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of albumin (a protein) in your urine. if treated early enough, it may be reversible.if you have type 2 diabetes, your gp or diabetes care team will need to take a reading of your blood glucose level about every two to six months.this will show how stable your glucose levels have been in the recent past and how well your treatment plan is working.the hba1c test is used to measure blood glucose levels over the previous two to three months.hba1c is a form of haemoglobin, the chemical that carries oxygen in red blood cells, which also has glucose attached to it.a high hba1c level means that your blood glucose level has been consistently high over recent weeks, and your diabetes treatment plan may need to be changed.your diabetes care team can help you set a target hba1c level to aim for. this will usually be less than 53 mmol/mol (7%) or individualised as agreed with your diabetes team.read more about thehba1c testif you have type 2 diabetes, as well as having your blood glucose level checked by a healthcare professional every two to six months, you may be advised to monitor your own blood glucose levels at home.even if you have a healthy diet and are taking tablets or using insulin therapy, exercise, illness and stress can affect your blood glucose levels.other factors that may affect your blood glucose levels include drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle.a blood glucose meter is a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood. it can be useful for detecting high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) or low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia).if blood glucose monitoring is recommended, you should be trained in how to use a blood glucose meter and what you should do if the reading is too high or too low.blood glucose meters aren’t currently available for free on the nhs but, in some cases, blood monitoring strips may be. ask a member of your diabetes care team if you’re unsure.regularly monitoring your blood glucose levels will ensure your blood glucose is as normal and stable as possible.as your blood glucose level is likely to vary throughout the day, you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you’re taking.in home testing, blood glucose levels are usually measured by how many millimoles of glucose are in a litre of blood.a millimole is a measurement used to define the concentration of glucose in your blood. the measurement is expressed as millimoles per litre, or mmol/l for short.a normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals (preprandial) and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals (postprandial), although this can vary from person to person.your diabetes care team can discuss your blood glucose level with you in more detail. it’s important to know your individual targets.if diabetes isn’t treated, it can lead to a number of other health problems.high glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.even a mildly raised glucose level that doesn’t cause any symptoms can have long-term damaging effects.if you have diabetes, you’re up to five times more likely to developheart diseaseor have astroke.prolonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of atherosclerosis, where the blood vessels become clogged up and narrowed by fatty substances.this may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causingangina(a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking).it also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become blocked, leading to aheart attackor stroke.high blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels in your nerves.this can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. it can also cause numbness, which can lead to ulceration of the feet.damage to the peripheral nervous system, which includes all parts of the nervous system that lie outside the central nervous system, is known asperipheral neuropathy.if the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting,diarrhoeaorconstipation.diabetic retinopathy is when the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, becomes damaged.blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. this prevents light fully passing through to your retina. if it isn’t treated, it can damage your vision.annual eye checks are usually organised by a regional photographic unit. if significant damage is detected, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (ophthalmologist) such as cataract and glaucoma.the better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems.treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.if the condition hasn’t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, bp and cholesterol level is recommended.the main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are: laser treatment injections of medication into your eyes an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyesread about diabetic eye screening.if the small blood vessels of your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently.it’s usually associated with high blood pressure, and treating this is a key part of management.in rare, severe cases, kidney disease can lead tokidney failure. this can mean a kidney replacement, treatment withdialysisor sometimes kidney transplantation becomes necessary.damage to the nerves of the foot can mean small nicks and cuts aren’t noticed and this, in combination with poor circulation, can lead to a foot ulcer.about 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause a serious infection.if you have diabetes, look out for sores and cuts that don’t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. you should also have your feet examined at least once a year.if poor circulation or nerve damage is detected, check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist.in men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. this can usually be treated with medication.women with diabetes may experience: reduced sex drive (loss of libido) less pleasure from sex vaginal dryness less ability to orgasm pain during sexif you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication or find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk ofmiscarriageand stillbirth.if your blood glucose level isn’t carefully controlled during the early stages of pregnancy, there’s also an increased risk of the baby developing a birth defect.pregnant women with diabetes will usually have theirantenatal check-upsin hospital or a diabetic clinic, ideally with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy care (an obstetrician).this will allow your care team to keep a close eye on your blood glucose levels and control your insulin dosage more easily, as well as monitoring the growth and development of your baby.thediabetes ukwebsite has more information aboutdiabetes complications.thenhs diabetic eye screening programmewill arrange for you to have your eyes checked every year.everyone who is on a diabetes register will be given the opportunity to have a digital picture taken of the back of their eye. speak to your gp to register.if you have diabetes, you’re at greater risk of developing problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes.this is because diabetes is associated with poor blood circulation in the feet, and blood glucose can damage the nerves.to prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water.wear shoes that fit properly, and see foot care specialists (a podiatrist or chiropodist) regularly so any problems can be detected early.regularly check your feet for cuts, blisters or grazes as you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged.see your gp if you have a minor foot injury that doesn’t start to heal within a few days.if you have type 2 diabetes, you should be invited to have your eyes screened once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy.diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged.it can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long period of time (hyperglycaemia). left untreated, retinopathy can eventually lead to sight loss.read more aboutdiabetic eye screeningpeople with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can’t be relied upon for other conditions.if you have diabetes and you’re thinking about having a baby, it’s a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team.if you’re taking oral medications to manage your diabetes, this may need to change before you are pregnant. it’s important that you plan your pregnancy and discuss it with your diabetes team.planning your pregnancy means you can ensure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as they can be before you get pregnant.you’ll need to tightly control your blood glucose level – particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of your baby’s development – to reduce the risk of birth defects.you should also: check your medications – some tablets used to treat type 2 diabetes may harm your baby, so you may have to switch to insulin injections, stop statin medication or some blood pressure medications take a higher dose of folic acid tablets – folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems, and it’s recommended all women planning to have a baby take folic acid; women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg each day (only available on prescription) along with pregnancy multivitamins that include vitamin d have your eyes checked – retinopathy, which affects the blood vessels in the eyes, is a risk for all people with diabetes; as pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, it’s important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnantyour gp or diabetes care team can give you further advice.you’ll be best equipped to manage your diabetes day-to-day if you’re given information and education when you’re diagnosed and on an ongoing basis.thenational institute for health and care excellence (nice)recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves.structured patient education means there’s a planned course that: covers all aspects of diabetes is flexible in content is relevant to a person’s clinical and psychological needs is adaptable to a person’s educational and cultural backgroundfor type 2 diabetes, there are several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education.ask your diabetes care team about the adult education

impact the condition has on their lives.the main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, the elderly, and those with learning disabilities, mental health difficulties or diabetes complications.people over the age of 65 who are severely disabled may qualify for a type of disability benefit called attendance allowance.carers may also be entitled to some benefits, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes.citizens advice scotlandcan check whether you’re getting all the benefits you’re entitled to. your diabetes specialist nurse and citizens advice can also provide advice about filling in the forms.it’s a common myth that people with diabetes aren’t allowed to drive anymore. although there are some restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it’s not as severe as you may think.you should always tell your insurer that you have diabetes as this may affect your insurance claim. only individuals who use insulin have to tell the dvla that they have diabetes. a high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. this usually has to be renewed every 3 years.additional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g group 2 hgv) so always refer to thedvla guidelines.unfortunately, some individuals do lose their driving license, most commonly due to experiencing severe hypos.if you start to have a hypo whilst driving you should: pull over safely switch off your car engine take fast-acting carbs, like glucose tablets or sweets, and some longer-acting carbohydrates too, like plain biscuits or crackers don’t drive until 45 minutes after your blood sugar level has gone back to 5mmol/l or abovefor more information about driving with diabetes, visit diabetes uk.if you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you’re ill – known as your “sick day rules”.contact your diabetes care team or gp for advice if you haven’t received these.the advice you’re given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to: keep taking your insulin – it’s very important not to stop treatment when you’re ill; your treatment plan may state whether you need to temporarily increase your dose test your blood glucose level more often than usual – most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day keep yourself well hydrated – make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks keep eating – eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates

       " 'Transverse myelitis': 'transverse myelitis is a rare neurological condition. it’s caused by inflammation (swelling) of the spinal cord. the swelling damages the nerves and can leave permanent scars or lesions.the scars or lesions interrupt the communication between the nerves in the spinal cord and the rest of the body.‘transverse’ refers to the swelling being across the width of the spinal cord. it’s also sometimes used to describe swelling that only affects part of the width of the spinal cord.the symptoms of transverse myelitis can include:transverse myelitis can happen to anyone at any time in their life. in most cases there might only be one episode of symptoms, but sometimes it can happen repeatedly. transverse myelitis can be the first sign of ms or another condition.there are several different causes of transverse myelitis. sometimes a cause isn’t found, and this is called idiopathic transverse myelitis.sometimes transverse myelitis is caused by an autoimmune reaction. in autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakes the body’s own tissue as dangerous and attacks it. this causes swelling that results in damage to the myelin sheath. this includes: ms-like swelling neuromyelitis optica (nmo) myelin oligodendrocyte antibody (mog) associated myelitis sarcoidosis sjögrens syndrome lupussometimes transverse myelitis is caused indirectly by a viral infection, although often the virus responsible isn’t identified.transverse myelitis often develops after a viral infection like: echovirus enterovirus epstien-barr hepatitis a herpes simplex hiv rubella influenza (flu) varicella zoster (the virus that causes chicken pox and shingles)bacterial infections such assyphilismight also lead to transverse myelitis.some cancers might trigger an unusual immune response that can lead to transverse myelitis.if your gp thinks you could have transverse myelitis, you should see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment.some of the tests you may need to confirm transverse myelitis are: neurological examination magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan lumbar puncture blood testssometimes your neurologist will do other tests to look for conditions that cause transverse myelitis. this might includect scans.sometimes transverse myelitis requires no treatment as it will improve on its own. sometimes patients may require treatment for their symptoms, the swelling, or the underlying cause.there are different treatments available for transverse myelitis symptoms.physiotherapy can help improve strength, and the muscle spasms and stiffness that may sometimes develop.techniques such as stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted.if your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles. this will usually be either baclofen, gabapentin or tizanidine.these medicines all have side effects. you might experience dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea. discuss which of these would be best for you with your healthcare professional.mobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity. muscle weakness, or problems with balance can also cause mobility problems.if you have problems with mobility, your healthcare professional might suggest: an exercise programme supervised by a physiotherapist mobility aids, such as a walking stick, or a wheelchair home adaptations such as stair lifts or railingsanoccupational therapistcan carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations.sometimes your neurologist might offer treatment with steroids. this can help with some types of transverse myelitis. steroids are only given for a short period of time to avoid possiblesteroid side effects. the side effects could include reflux and stomach irritation, worsening infection, mood swings, and difficulty sleeping.medication might help if you have an overactive bladder or need to pee frequently during the night.if you find it difficult to empty your bladder, advice from a continence nurse or physiotherapist can help. hand-held external stimulators can help some people to start peeing or to empty the bladder.sometimes acathetercan empty the bladder when needed. you might be taught how to do intermittent self catheterisation (isc).in rare cases, people with transverse myelitis may need a long-term catheter to keep the bladder emptying safely.you might be referred to a continence adviser or urologist, for specialist treatment and advice. read more abouttreating urinary incontinence.it

skin irritated and red eyes you have symptoms of ulcerative colitis and you haven’t been diagnosed with the conditionsome people may go for weeks or months with very mild symptoms, or none at all. this is known as remission. this may be followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome. these are known as flare-ups or relapses.symptoms of flare-ups vary from person-to-person. they may include: diarrhoea 6 or more times a day blood or mucus in your poo severe abdominal pain symptoms in other parts of your bodysevere ulcerative colitis can also cause symptoms like: shortness of breath a fast or irregular heartbeat a high temperature (fever) blood in your poo becoming more obvious you have ulcerative colitis and think you’re having a flare-upthe exact cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown.a combination of factors may be responsible, including: problems with your immune system – where the immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of your large bowel, making it inflamed genetics – genes you inherit from your family environmental factors – like air pollution, medication and viruses or bacteria in your gutto help diagnose ulcerative colitis, your gp will ask about your: your pattern of symptoms your diet any recent travel – for example, you may have developed travellers’ diarrhoea whether you’re taking any medication, including any over-the-counter medicines whether anyone else in your family has a bowel condition any health problems you’ve had in the pastyour gp may also: examine your abdomen (tummy) ask for a stool (poo) sample and use a qfit test to check for blood and mucus, infection or inflammation via a faecal calprotectin test arrangeblood teststo check for inflammation oranaemiaif your gp thinks that you have ulcerative colitis you may be referred to hospital for more tests. these could include: colonoscopy– a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the whole of your large bowel sigmoidoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the end of your large bowel x-ray mri scanorcomputerised tomography (ct)you will be told what tests you need and what you need to do to prepare for them.treatment for ulcerative colitis aims to relieve and prevent symptoms.your treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and how often they flare up. mild flare-ups can be usually be treated at home. but severe flare-ups usually need treatment in hospital to reduce the risk of complications.treatment will usually be provided by a range of healthcare professionals.most people will get medication to treat symptoms of ulcerative colitis. this includes medications like: aminosalicylates (asas) – often the first treatment option, used to get and keep inflammation under control and can be given rectally as well as orally corticosteroids– used to get inflammation under control quickly, but not suitable for long-term useif you have lots of flare-ups or aminosalicylates do not keep your inflammation under control, you may need other treatments, such as: immunosuppressants like azathioprine or mercaptopurine – used to reduce the activity of the immune system biologic medicines, like adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, ustekinumab or vedolizumab other advanced medicines like filgotinib, ozanimod, tofacitinib and upadacitinibsurgery to treat ulcerative colitis may be an option if: you choose to have surgery instead of taking medications that may cause side effects medications don’t control your symptoms your quality of life is severely affected by your condition you have serious complications of ulcerative colitissurgery for ulcerative colitis involves removing part or all of your large bowel (known as a colectomy). this means the small intestine must be used to pass waste products out of your body instead.during the surgery, your small intestine will either be: joined to the surface of your tummy (known as anileostomyor a colostomy) – after this type of surgery, poo comes out of the opening on your tummy and is collected in special bags that you wear joined directly to your rectum (the end of your large bowel), so your poo comes out of your bottom as usual used to create an internal pouch that’s connected to your bottom (known as an ileo-anal pouch or j-pouch) – this means your poo can pass through your bottom as usualthere’s no evidence that a particular diet causes ulcerative colitis. but alongside medications, some changes to your diet may help control symptoms for some people.you could: eat 5 to 6 small meals rather than 3 main meals try to eat a healthy, varied diet that includes a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, proteins and wholegrains drink plenty of wateryou could also speak to your ibd team about: keeping a food diary to find out if any particular foods affect your symptoms removing trigger foods from your diet – but do not make major changes to your diet without talking to your ibd team and make sure you are still getting all the nutrients you need taking a food supplement if you are struggling to get enough nutrients from your diet being referred to a dietitianstress doesn’t cause ulcerative colitis. but, managing stress may reduce how often you get symptoms.to help manage stress, you could: exercise– speak to your ibd team about a suitable exercise plan try relaxation techniques like yoga, medication and breathing exercises talk to others – crohn’s & colitis uk has details oflocal support groups speak to your gp if you think you may havedepressiona woman’s chance of becoming pregnant isn’t usually affected by ulcerative colitis.however, surgery for ulcerative colitis might affect your fertility, especially pouch surgery.most women with ulcerative colitis will have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. but if you’re pregnant or planning a pregnancy you should discuss it with your ibd team. this is because they may need to change your medication.if you’re having a flare-up of ulcerative colitis you may also be advised to avoid getting pregnant until it’s under control.if you have ulcerative colitis, you may be at an increased risk of developing other problems. this can include: osteoporosis poor growth and development in children and young peoplemore serious and rare complications can include: primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) – inflammation in the bile ducts, which can lead to liver damage narrowing’s in the bowel (strictures) that may become blocked or make it difficult for poo to pass through toxic

gain and feeling depressed.an underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn’t making.there’s no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage to the thyroid that occurs during some treatments for an overactive thyroid orthyroid cancer.read more about thecauses of an underactive thyroidsymptoms of an underactive thyroidare often similar to those of other conditions, and they usually develop slowly, so you may not notice them for years.you should see your gp and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid if you have symptoms including: tiredness weight gain depression being sensitive to the cold dry skin and hair muscle achesthe only accurate way of finding out whether you have a thyroid problem is to have a thyroid function test, where a sample of blood is tested to measure your hormone levels.read more abouttesting for an underactive thyroidboth men and women can have an underactive thyroid, although it’s more common in women. in the uk, it affects 15 in every 1,000 women and 1 in 1,000 men. children can also develop an underactive thyroid.around 1 in 3,500 to 4,000 babies are born with an underactive thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). all babies born in the uk are screened for congenital hypothyroidism using ablood spot testwhen the baby is about 5 days old.treatment for an underactive thyroid involves taking daily hormone replacement tablets, called levothyroxine, to raise your thyroxine levels. you’ll usually need treatment for the rest of your life. however, with proper treatment, you should be able to lead a normal, healthy life.if an underactive thyroid isn’t treated, it can lead to complications, includingheart disease, goitre, pregnancy problems and a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare).read more abouttreating an underactive thyroidand thecomplications of an underactive thyroidmany symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) are the same as those of other conditions, so it can easily be confused for something else.symptoms usually develop slowly and you may not realise you have a medical problem for several years.common symptoms include: tiredness being sensitive to cold weight gain constipation depression slow movements and thoughts muscle aches and weakness muscle cramps dry and scaly skin brittle hair and nails loss of libido (sex drive) pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome) irregular periods or heavy periodselderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression. children may experience slower growth and development. teenagers may start puberty earlier than normal.if you have any of these symptoms, see your gp and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid.read more aboutgetting tested for an underactive thyroidit’s unlikely that you’d have many of the later symptoms of an underactive thyroid, because the condition is often identified before more serious symptoms appear.later symptoms of an underactive thyroid include: a low-pitched and hoarse voice a puffy-looking face thinned or partly missing eyebrows a slow heart rate hearing loss anaemiaan underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is when your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called t4).most cases of an underactive thyroid are caused by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage that occurs as a result of treatments forthyroid canceror anoveractive thyroid.an underactive thyroid often occurs when the immune system, which usually fights infection, attacks the thyroid gland. this damages the thyroid, which means it’s not able to make enough of the hormone thyroxine, leading to thesymptoms of an underactive thyroid.a condition called hashimoto’s disease is the most common type of autoimmune reaction that causes an underactive thyroid.it’s not clear what causes hashimoto’s disease, but it runs in families. it’s also common in people with another immune system disorder, such astype 1 diabetesand vitiligo.an underactive thyroid can also occur as a side effect or complication of previous treatment to the thyroid gland, such as surgery or a treatment called radioactive iodine therapy.these treatments are sometimes used for an overactive thyroid (where the thyroid gland produces too much hormone) or thyroid cancer.worldwide, a lack of dietary iodine is a common cause of an underactive thyroid, because the body needs iodine to make thyroxine. however, iodine deficiency is uncommon in the uk.babies are sometimes born with an underactive thyroid because the thyroid gland doesn’t develop properly in the womb. this is called congenital hypothyroidism and is uncommon, affecting around 1 in 3,000 babies. it’s usually picked up during routine screening soon after birth.a problem with the pituitary gland could lead to an underactive thyroid. the pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and regulates the thyroid. therefore, damage to the pituitary gland may lead to an underactive thyroid.an underactive thyroid has also been linked to some viral infections or some medications used to treat other conditions, such as: lithium – a medication sometimes used to treat certain mental health conditions, includingdepressionandbipolar disorder amiodarone – a medication sometimes used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) interferons – a class of medication sometimes used to treat certain types ofcancerandhepatitis cspeak to your gp or specialist if you’re concerned that a medication you’re taking may be affecting your thyroid hormone levels.it’s very important that an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is diagnosed as soon as possible.low levels of thyroid-producing hormones, such as triiodothyronine (t3) and thyroxine (t4), can change the way the body processes fat.this can causehigh cholesterolandatherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries), which can potentially lead to serious heart-related problems, such asanginaandheart attack.therefore, you should see your gp and ask for ablood testif you repeatedly havesymptoms of an underactive thyroid.a blood test measuring your hormone levels is the only accurate way to find out whether there’s a problem.the test, called a thyroid function test, looks at levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) and thyroxine (t4) in the blood.a high level of tsh and a low level of t4 in the blood could mean you have an underactive thyroid.if your test results show raised tsh but normal t4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future.your gp may recommend that you have a repeat blood test every so often to see whether you eventually develop an underactive thyroid.blood tests are also sometimes used for other measurements, such as checking the level of a hormone called triiodothyronine (t3). however, this isn’t routine, because t3 levels can often remain normal, even if you have a significantly underactive thyroid.thelab tests online ukwebsite has more information about the different types ofthyroid function tests.your gp may refer you to an endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone disorders) if you: are younger than 16 are pregnant or trying to get pregnant have just given birth have another health condition, such asheart disease, which may complicate your medication are taking a medication known to cause a reduction in thyroid hormones, such as amiodarone or lithiuman underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is usually treated by taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine.levothyroxine replaces the thyroxine hormone, which your thyroid doesn’t make enough of.you’ll initially have regularblood testsuntil the correct dose of levothyroxine is reached. this can take a little while to get right.you may start on a low dose of levothyroxine, which may be increased gradually, depending on how your body responds. some people start to feel better soon after beginning treatment, while others don’t notice an improvement in their symptoms for several monthsonce you’re taking the correct dose, you’ll usually have a blood test once a year to monitor your hormone levels.if blood tests suggest you may have an underactive thyroid, but you don’t have any symptoms or they’re very mild, you may not need any treatment. in these cases, your gp will usually monitor your hormone levels every few months and prescribe levothyroxine if you develop symptoms.if you’re prescribed levothyroxine, you should take 1 tablet at the same time every day. it’s usually recommended that you take the tablets in the morning, although some people prefer to take them at night.the effectiveness of the tablets can be altered by other medications, supplements or foods, so they should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach, and you should avoid eating for 30 minutes afterwards.if you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, if this is within a few hours of your usual time. if you don’t remember until later than this, skip the dose and take the next dose at the usual time, unless advised otherwise by your doctor.an underactive thyroid is a lifelong condition, so you’ll usually need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life.levothyroxine doesn’t usually have any side effects, because the tablets simply replace a missing hormone.side effects usually only occur if you’re taking too much levothyroxine. this can cause problems including sweating,chest pain,headaches,diarrhoeaand vomiting.tell your doctor if you develop new symptoms while taking levothyroxine. you should also let them know if your symptoms get worse or don’t improve.in the uk, combination therapy – using levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (t3) together – isn’t routinely used because there’s insufficient evidence to show it’s better than using levothyroxine alone (monotherapy).in most cases, suppressing thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) using high dose thyroid replacement therapy should be avoided because it carries a risk of causing adverse side effects, such asatrial fibrillation(an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate),strokes,osteoporosisand fracture.however, this type of treatment may sometimes be recommended in cases where a person has a history ofthyroid cancerand there’s a significant risk of it reoccurring.several complications can occur if you have an underactive thyroid that isn’t treated.if you have an untreated underactive thyroid, your risk of developingcardiovascular diseaseis increased.this is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood.high cholesterolcan cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries, restricting the flow of blood.contact your doctor if you’re being treated for an underactive thyroid and you developchest pain, so that any problems can be detected and treated, if necessary.a goitre is an abnormal swelling of the thyroid gland that causes a lump to form in the throat. goitres can develop in people with an underactive thyroid when the body tries to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones.if an underactive thyroid isn’t treated during pregnancy, there’s a risk of problems occurring. these include: pre-eclampsia– which can causehigh blood pressureand fluid retention in the mother and growth problems in the baby anaemiain the mother an underactive thyroid in the baby birth defects bleeding after birth problems with the baby’s physical and mental development premature birth or a low birthweight stillbirthormiscarriagethese problems can usually be avoided with treatment under the guidance of a specialist in hormone disorders (an endocrinologist). therefore, tell your gp if you have an underactive thyroid and you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant.in very rare cases, a severe underactive thyroid may lead to a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma. this is where the thyroid hormone levels become very low, causing symptoms such as confusion,hypothermiaand drowsiness.myxoedema coma requires emergency treatment in hospital. it’s usually treated with thyroid hormone replacement medication given directly into a vein. in some cases, other treatments such as breathing support,antibioticsand steroid medication (corticosteroids) are also required. overactive thyroid lab tests online: tsh lab tests online uk: t4 test british thyroid foundation',\n",

exact reason why this happens in cases of vaginal cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.human papilloma virus (hpv) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. hpv is spread during sex, including anal and oral sex.there are many different types of hpv and up to 8 out of every 10 people are infected with the virus at some time during their lives. in most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn’t lead to vaginal cancer.however, hpv is present in more than two-thirds of people with vaginal cancer, which suggests that it may increase your risk of developing the condition.hpv is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead tocervical cancer. it’s thought that the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vagina.you’re more likely to develop vaginal cancer if you’ve previously been found to have abnormal cells in your: cervix – known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) vagina – known as vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (vain)cin and vain are terms used to describe cells that are abnormal, but not different enough to be considered cancerous. both are thought to be closely linked to having a persistent hpv infection.the abnormal cells don’t usually cause any problems themselves and may only be detected duringcervical screening, but left untreated there is a small chance they could eventually become cancerous.if you’re found to have cin or vain, a procedure to remove or destroy the abnormal cells may be recommended.a medicine called diethylstilbestrol is known to increase your risk of vaginal cancer. the medication was widely prescribed during pregnancy between 1938 and 1971, because it was thought it could help reduce the risk ofmiscarriage.however, in 1971, researchers discovered a link between diethylstilbestrol and cancer in the children of women given the medicine. the use of diethylstilbestrol during pregnant was then banned.the risk of vaginal cancer associated with diethylstilbestrol is small and as it’s now over 40 years since it was last used during pregnancies, cases of vaginal cancer linked to the medication are very rare.other things that may increase your risk of vaginal cancer include: your age – 7 out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer occur in women and anyone with a vagina over 60 having a history of reproductive cancers, such ascervical cancerorvulval cancer– particularly if you were treated

carry out a physical examination.they may also refer you forblood teststo rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as infection.if your gp cannot find an obvious cause of your symptoms, they will probably refer you to a gynaecologist for further testing. a gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system.if your gp refers you urgently because they think you have cancer, you have the right to be seen by a specialist within 2 weeks.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends that gps consider referring a woman who has an unexplained mass in or at the entrance to their vagina.if you are referred to a gynaecologist, you may have: external and internal vaginal examinations to look for any unusual lumps or swellings acolposcopy– an examination where a special instrument (colposcope) that acts like a magnifying glass is used to study your vagina in greater detailif your gynaecologist thinks there may be abnormal tissue inside your vagina, a small sample of the tissue will be removed and checked under a microscope for cancerous cells. this is known as abiopsy.if the results of the biopsy suggest you have cancer, you may have further tests to see if the cancer has spread.these tests may include a more detailed internal vaginal examination carried out undergeneral anaesthetic,x-rays,computerised tomography (ct) scansandmagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans.healthcare professionals use a staging system to describe how far vaginal cancer has advanced. stage 1 – the cancer has started to grow into the wall of the vagina stage 2 – the cancer has begun to spread outside the vagina into the surrounding tissues stage 3 – the cancer has spread into your pelvis and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes stage 4a – the cancer has spread beyond your vagina and into organs such as your bladder or back passage (rectum) stage 4b – the cancer has spread into organs further away, such as the lungsthe stage of your cancer is important in determining which treatment is most appropriate and whether a cure is possible. generally, the lower the stage when cancer is diagnosed, the better the chance of a cure.if a cure is not possible, treatment can still help relieve any symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer. read more abouthow vaginal cancer is treated.read further information: cancer research uk: tests for vaginal cancer cancer research uk: stages of vaginal cancertreatment for vaginal cancer will depend on where the cancer is in your vagina and how far it has spread. possible treatments include radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.when you are diagnosed with cancer, you will be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals, known as a multidisciplinary team (mdt).your mdt will include a range of specialists, including surgeons, clinical oncologists (specialists in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and specialist cancer nurses.your mdt will recommend a treatment plan they feel is most suitable for you, but the final decision will be yours.before going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.radiotherapyis the main treatment for vaginal cancer. it can be used: as an initial treatment to cure the cancer in combination with chemotherapy (chemoradiation) after surgery to prevent the cancer from returning to control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative radiotherapy)there are 2 main ways that radiotherapy for vaginal cancer can be given: external radiotherapy – a machine beams high-energy rays at your vagina and pelvis internal radiotherapy – a small radioactive device, which looks like a tampon, is inserted into your vaginathe type of radiotherapy you receive depends on where the cancer is in your body. for example, internal radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is in the lining of your vagina, and external radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is deeper in the tissues of the vagina. you can receive a combination of internal and external radiotherapy.external radiotherapy is usually given for around 4 to 6 weeks in short daily sessions, from monday to friday. you return home between treatments and have a break at the weekends.internal radiotherapy may involve either a long treatment session where you need to stay in hospital for 24 hours, or several short day-case treatments.read more abouthow radiotherapy is performed.following radiotherapy, it’s likely you will have some side effects. these occur because radiotherapy temporarily damages some healthy cells as well as destroying cancerous ones.possible side effects of radiotherapy for vaginal cancer include: sore, red skin – similar tosunburn vaginal discharge pain while passing urine diarrhoea tiredness feeling sick narrowing of the vagina (see below) early menopause and infertility (see below)read more about theside effects of radiotherapy.radiotherapy may cause you to lose interest in sex, particularly if you have side effects such as tiredness or nausea, or you are anxious about your condition or treatment.radiotherapy can also cause scar tissue to form in your vagina, which can make it narrower and means having sex is difficult or uncomfortable.if you feel up to it, your care team may suggest having sex regularly during treatment to help stop this happening. devices called dilators, which are inserted into the vagina, can also be used after treatment stops to help stop your vagina getting narrower.you may also experience some vaginal dryness or pain when having sex. if this happens, you can try using lubricants or asking your care team about possible treatments.if you have external radiotherapy to your pelvis, you may experience an earlymenopause(if you have not had the menopause already).this means you will no longer be able to have children (infertility). before your treatment, your care team will explain whether this is a risk and discuss the options and support available.there are 4 main types of surgery used to treat vaginal cancer: partial vaginectomy – removing the upper section of your vagina radical vaginectomy – removing all of your vagina and pelvic lymph nodes radical vaginectomy and radical hysterectomy – removing all of your vagina, womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes and pelvic lymph nodes pelvic exenteration – removing all of your vagina and surrounding tissue, including the bladder and/or rectum (back passage)a partial vaginectomy can be used to treat stage 1 vaginal cancer, when radiotherapy has failed to remove the cancer or where a woman prefers to have surgery rather than radiotherapy because she still wants to have children.your surgeon will remove the cancerous section of the vagina, as well as some surrounding healthy tissue, just in case a small number of cancerous cells have spread.your surgeon will repair the defect in the vaginal wall, which means you will be able to have sex after you have recovered from the operation.a radical vaginectomy may be used to treat cases of advanced stage 1 and stage 2 vaginal cancer. the surgeon will remove most, or all, of your vagina.a plastic surgeon may be able to make a new vagina using skin, muscle and tissue taken from another part of your body – usually one of your thighs or buttocks.you will still be able to have sex after a vaginal reconstruction, although you will need to use lubricant, because the lining of the new vagina cannot make the mucus it would naturally make.a radical hysterectomy is often performed at the same time as a radical vaginectomy.during a radical hysterectomy, all of the reproductive system is removed, including the womb, fallopian tubes, ovaries and nearby lymph nodes.pelvic exenteration is used in a few cases to treat recurrent or advanced cases of vaginal cancer.if you no longer have a bladder, you will need another way to pass urine. one solution is for your surgeon to make a hole (stoma) in your tummy. a bag is then attached to the stoma so that urine can be passed into it. the bag is known as a urostomy bag.similarly, as you may no longer have a rectum, you will need a way to pass stools (faeces) out of your digestive system. another stoma can be made and attached to a collection bag, known as a colostomy bag.read more aboutcolostomies.a vaginal reconstruction can be carried out after a pelvic exenteration. it may also be possible to reconstruct your rectum and attach it to the remaining section of your bowel once this has healed. in this case, you will only need a temporary colostomy.as pelvic exenteration is major surgery, it may take you several months to fully recover from the operation.chemotherapyis usually used in combination with radiotherapy or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative chemotherapy). it’s usually given by injection (intravenous chemotherapy).like radiotherapy, the powerful cancer-killing medicines used in chemotherapy can also damage healthy tissue and cause a range of side effects. side effects of chemotherapy for vaginal cancer can include: tiredness feeling sick increased risk of infections diarrhoea hair lossread more about theside effects of chemotherapy.treatment for vaginal cancer can have a significant emotional impact, particularly for young women who experience an early menopause as a result of treatment.the removal of some or all of the vagina can be traumatic for pre- and post-menopausal women alike, and some women feel less ‘womanly’ than they did before. it’s not uncommon to feel a sense of loss and bereavement after treatment. in some women, this may lead todepression.you may find it helpful to talk to other women who have had similar treatment. your gp or hospital staff may be able to recommend a suitable local

veins.when the small valves in the veins stop working properly, it’s difficult for blood to be pushed against gravity and it can leak backwards.this increases the pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. it is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid.varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins aren’t working properly.read more about thecauses of varicose eczema.varicose eczema tends to be a long-term problem. however, treatments are available to help keep it under control.for most people, treatment involves a combination of: self-help measures – including ways to improve your circulation, such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry) topical corticosteroids– ointments and creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms compression stockings – specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that steadily squeeze your legs and help to improve your circulationif these treatments don’t help, your gp may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) in case there is another cause for your symptoms or if they are concerned you may also have a type of eczema called contact dermatitis.if you also have varicose veins, you may be referred to a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) who can talk to you about thetreatment options for varicose veins.read more abouttreating varicose eczema.varicose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in your leg veins.inside your veins there are valves that let the blood through in one direction and prevent it flowing backwards.sometimes, the walls of the veins can become stretched and lose their elasticity, causing the valves to become weakened. if the valves do not function properly, blood may leak backwards.this increases the pressure in your veins, which may cause fluid to leak into surrounding tissues. it is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of your immune system reacting to these fluids in the tissues under your skin.this increase in pressure can also cause blood to collect in your veins, which become swollen and enlarged (varicose veins).it is not fully understood why the walls of the veins stretch and the valves weaken. some people develop the condition for no obvious reason, although there are certain factors that increase the chances of this happening, including: gender – varicose eczema is more common in women obesity– this can increase the pressure in your leg veins pregnancy – this can also increase the pressure in your leg veins not being able to move for a long period of time – this can affect the circulation in your leg veins having previously haddeep vein thrombosis (dvt)– blood clots that develop in leg veins, which can damage the valves in your veins increasing age – people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulationsee your gp if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. they can usually make a diagnosis by simply looking at the affected areas.your gp will also ask you questions to determine whether you have a problem with the flow of blood in your leg veins, as this is the main cause of varicose eczema.to help make a diagnosis, your gp may want to know if you have a history of: varicose veins– swollen and enlarged veins deep vein thrombosis (dvt)– a blood clot in one of the deep veins of your legs leg ulcers– areas of damaged skin that take several weeks to heal cellulitis– an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue surgery or injury to your legsyour gp may also check the pulse in your feet and they may carry out an ankle brachial pressure index (abpi) test to see if compression stockings are suitable for you. see the section ontreating varicose eczemafor more information about these.the abpi test involves comparing blood pressure readings taken from your ankles and upper arms. a significant difference in the readings suggests a problem with the flow of blood in your arteries – in which case, compression stockings may not be safe to use.you may be referred to a specialist in a local hospital for further tests. this might be a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) or a dermatologist (a specialist in skin conditions) if: you have varicose veins and changes

circulation (blood flow).for many people, this will involve long-term treatment with a combination of: emollients (moisturisers) topical corticosteroids compression stockingsthere are also some self-help techniques that you can try. these treatment options are described in more detail below.lipodermatosclerosis (hardened, tight skin) is treated in a similar way to varicose eczema. if you have avenous leg ulcer, you can also read abouttreating venous leg ulcers.there are some steps you can take to reduce the symptoms of varicose eczema and help prevent further problems, such as: try to avoid injuring your skin – injuries to your skin could lead to an ulcer developing raise your legs when you are resting – for example, by propping up your feet on some pillows (ideally so that they are above the level of your heart), as this can help reduce swelling keep physically active – this will improve your circulation and help you maintain a healthy weightfluid can build up in the lower legs if you sit or stand for too long, so it is important to keep moving. walking will get your muscles working and help to push the blood through the veins to your heart.thenational eczema societyalso recommends regularly flexing your feet and rising up onto your toes or bending down at the knees.emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. they are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.a number of different emollients are available. some can be bought over the counter without a prescription, but if you have varicose eczema it may be helpful to ask your gp to recommend a suitable product.you may need to try several different emollients to find one that works for you. you may also be prescribed a mixture of emollients, for example: an ointment for very dry skin a cream or lotion for less dry skin an emollient to use instead of soap an emollient to add to bath water or use in the showerthe difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil that they contain. ointments contain the most oil, so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. lotions contain the least amount of oil, so are not greasy, but can be less effective. creams are somewhere in between.if you have varicose eczema, you should use an emollient at least twice a day, even if you do not have any symptoms.to apply the emollient: use a large amount – you should aim to cover all of the skin on your lower leg, not just the obviously affected areas don’t rub it in – instead, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows apply every 2 to 3 hours for very dry skin after a bath or shower, gently dry the skin, then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist do not share emollients with other peopleit is very important to keep using emollients during a flare-up of varicose eczema, because this is when the skin needs the most moisture. apply emollients frequently and in generous amounts during a flare-up.it’s unusual for emollients to cause side effects, but they can occasionally cause a rash, and greasy emollients may sometimes cause folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles). if you experience any side effects from your emollient, speak to your gp, who can prescribe an alternative product.emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.if your skin is inflamed from a flare-up of varicose eczema, your gp may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin in the form of a cream or ointment) to quickly reduce the inflammation. they are also commonly known as topical steroids.different strength topical corticosteroids can be prescribed, depending on the severity of your varicose eczema. if you have flare-ups of lipodermatosclerosis, you may need a very strong topical corticosteroid.when using corticosteroids, only apply the treatment to the affected areas. your doctor can advise you on how much to apply and how often. you can also check the advice in the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication.most people only have to apply a topical corticosteroid once a day. when applying the medication, you should: apply your emollient first and wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid (until the emollient has soaked into your skin) apply it only to the affected area use the topical corticosteroid for 7 to 14 days and continue to apply the treatment for 48 hours after the flare-up has clearedif your varicose eczema is moderate to severe, you may need to apply topical corticosteroids both between flare-ups and during them.if you need to use topical corticosteroids on a long-term basis, you should apply them less frequently. your gp will advise you on how often you should be applying them.you should also speak to your gp if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved.topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them, particularly if using a cream.generally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for prolonged periods will increase your risk of getting more serious side effects, such as thinning of the skin. your doctor will advise you as to the strength of the medication you require and when you should use it.medical compression stockings are specially designed to steadily squeeze your legs to help improve your circulation. they are tightest at the ankle and get gradually looser as they go further up your leg. this encourages blood to flow upwards towards your heart.medical compression stockings are used to treat varicose eczema and lipodermatosclerosis by improving the flow of blood through your leg veins and reducing the pressure in the veins.compression stockings are available in a variety of different sizes and pressures. they are also available in: different colours different lengths – some come up to the knee and others also cover the thigh (you should only need knee-high stockings for varicose eczema) different foot styles – some cover the whole foot and some stop before the toessupport stockings or tights that lightly compress the legs can be bought from pharmacies. compression stockings that compress the legs more are available on prescription and will require you to be measured by a nurse first.in some cases, if you find it difficult to put on your stockings, you may be advised to use a tubular bandage instead.you will usually need to put your compression stockings on as soon as you get up in the morning and take them off when you go to bed. wearing compression stockings can be uncomfortable, particularly during hot weather, but it is important to wear them correctly to get the most benefit from them.pull them all the way up so that the correct level of compression is applied to each part of your leg. do not let the stocking roll down, or it may dig into your skin in a tight band around your leg. speak to your gp if the stockings are uncomfortable, they do not seem to fit, or you have difficulty putting them on. it may be possible to get custom-made stockings that will fit you exactly.take care when putting compression stockings on and taking them off, as this can damage fragile skin. if you have a leg ulcer, it ideally needs to heal before you start wearing compression stockings.compression stockings usually have to be replaced every 3 to 6 months. speak to your gp if your stockings become damaged, as they may no longer be effective.you should be prescribed 2 stockings (or 2 sets of stockings if you are wearing 1 on each leg) so that 1 stocking can be worn while the other is being washed and dried. compression stockings should be hand-washed in warm water and dried away from direct heat.if you havevaricose veins, as well as varicose eczema, treating these may sometimes be helpful.if your gp thinks treatment may be beneficial, they can refer you to a vascular surgeon, who can arrange for anultrasound scanof your leg to find the faulty blood vessels. treatment of your varicose veins can then be planned.there are a number of treatments available that can improve the symptoms and appearance of varicose veins, including: endothermal ablation – where energy from either high-frequency radio waves or lasers is used to seal the affected veins sclerotherapy – where a special foam is injected into your veins to seal them ligation and stripping – where affected veins are tied off and surgically removedthese procedures are usually performed in the day surgery

it’s not safe to apply compression if the ankle artery pressures are low.read more abouthow venous leg ulcers are treated.in some cases, your gp or nurse may decide to refer you to a specialist in conditions affecting the blood vessels (vascular specialist).for example, you may be referred to a vascular specialist if your gp or nurse is unsure about your diagnosis, or if they suspect your ulcer may be caused by artery diseases, diabetes orrheumatoid arthritis.after taking your medical history and examining you, the vascular specialist may need to arrange further investigations to plan your treatment.with appropriate treatment, most venous leg ulcers heal within 3 to 4 months.treatment should always be carried out by a healthcare professional trained in compression therapy for leg ulcers. usually, this will be a practice or district nurse.the first step is to remove any debris or dead tissue from the ulcer and apply an appropriate dressing. this provides the best conditions for the ulcer to heal.a simple, non-sticky dressing will be used to dress your ulcer. this usually needs to be changed once a week. many people find they can manage cleaning and dressing their own ulcer under the supervision of a nurse.to improve vein circulation in your legs and treat swelling, your nurse will apply a firm compression bandage over the affected leg. these bandages are designed to squeeze your legs and encourage blood to flow upwards, towards your heart.there are many different types of bandage or elastic stockings used to treat venous leg ulcers, which may be made in 2, 3 or 4 different layers. the application of a compression bandage is a skilled procedure and they should only be applied by trained healthcare staff.the bandage is changed once a week, when the dressing is changed.when compression bandages are first applied to an unhealthy ulcer, it’s usually painful. ideally, you should haveparacetamolor an alternative painkiller prescribed by your gp. the pain will lessen once the ulcer starts to heal, but this can take up to 10-12 days.it’s important to wear your compression bandage exactly as instructed. if you have any problems, it’s usually best to contact your nurse, instead of trying to remove it yourself. if the compression bandage feels a little too tight and is uncomfortable in bed at night, getting up for a short walk will usually help.however, you’ll need to cut the bandage off if: you get severe pain at the front of your ankle you get severe pain on the top of your foot your toes become blue and swollenonce you remove the bandage, make sure you keep your leg highly elevated and contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.in some clinics, specialist teams are using new alternatives to compression bandages, such as special stockings or other compressive devices. these may not be available in every clinic but could change the way ulcers are treated in future. your specialist will be able to advise you whether a different approach may help you.venous leg ulcers are often accompanied by swelling of your feet and ankles (oedema), which is caused by fluid. this can be controlled by compression bandages.keeping your leg elevated whenever possible, ideally with your toes at the same level as your eyes, will also help ease swelling. you should put a suitcase, sofa cushion or foam wedge under the bottom of your mattress, to help keep your legs raised while you sleep.you should also keep as active as possible and aim to continue with your normal activities. regular exercise, such as a daily walk, will help reduce leg swelling. however, you should avoid standing or sitting still with your feet down. you should elevate your feet at least every hour.some people with venous leg ulcers develop rashes with scaly and itchy skin.this is often due tovaricose eczema, which can be treated with a moisturiser (emollient) and occasionally a mildcorticosteroidcream or ointment. in rare cases, you may need to be referred to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for treatment.itchy skin can also sometimes be caused by an allergic reaction to the dressings or creams applied by your nurse. if this happens, you may need to be tested for allergies.it’s important to avoid scratching your legs if they feel itchy, because this damages the skin and may lead to further ulcers.to help your ulcer heal more quickly, follow the advice below: try to keep active by walking regularly. sitting and standing still without elevating your legs can make venous leg ulcers and swelling worse whenever you’re sitting or lying down, keep your affected leg elevated – with your toes level with your eyes regularly exercise your legs by moving your feet up and down, and rotating them at the ankles. this can help encourage better circulation if you’re overweight, try to reduce your weight with ahealthy dietand regular exercise stop smoking moderate your alcohol consumption be careful not to injure your affected leg, and wear comfortable, well-fitting footwearyou may also find it helpful to attend a local healthy leg club, such as those provided by thelindsay leg club foundation, for support and advice.an ulcer sometimes produces a large amount of discharge and becomes more painful. there may also be redness around the ulcer. these symptoms and feeling unwell are signs of infection.if your ulcer becomes infected, it should be cleaned and dressed as usual.you should also elevate your leg most of the time and you’ll be prescribed a 7-day course ofantibiotics.the aim of antibiotic treatment is to clear the infection. however, antibiotics don’t heal ulcers and should only be used in short courses to treat infected ulcers.you should visit your nurse once a week to have your dressings and compression bandages changed. they’ll also monitor the ulcer to see how well it’s healing. once your ulcer is healing well, your nurse will see you less often.once you’ve had a venous leg ulcer, another ulcer could develop within months or years.the most effective method of preventing this is to wear compression stockings at all times when you’re out of bed. your nurse will help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself.various accessories are available to help you put them on and take them off.read more aboutpreventing venous leg ulcers.you can help reduce your risk of

have previously had a leg ulcer.if you’ve previously had a venous leg ulcer, or you’re at risk of developing one, treatment with compression stockings may be recommended by your gp.these stockings are specially designed to squeeze your legs, improving your circulation. they’re usually tightest at the ankle and less tight further up your leg – this encourages blood to flow upwards, towards your heart.to be most effective, these stockings should be put on as soon as you get up and only taken off at night.compression stockings are available in a variety of sizes, colours, styles and pressures. a nurse can help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself. there are various accessories you can buy to help get the stockings on and off.if you’reobeseor overweight, losing weight can help treat and prevent venous leg ulcers. excess weight leads to high pressure in the veins in your legs, which can damage your skin. venous ulcers are much more common among people

than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell.there are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. for example,iron deficiency anaemia, which occurs when the body doesn’t contain enough iron.vitamin b12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy.a deficiency in

the rest of your life.folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. these usually need to be taken for four months.in some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it recurring. vitamin b12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, yeast extract (such as marmite) and specially fortified foods. the best sources of folate include green vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts and peas.read abouttreating vitamin b12 or folate deficiencyalthough it’s uncommon, vitamin b12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications,

important for vitamin b12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible if left untreated. the longer the condition goes untreated, the higher the chance of permanent damage.vitamin b12 or folate deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of either of these vitamins affects the body’s ability to produce fully functioning red blood cells.red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. most people with vitamin b12 or folate deficiency anaemia have underdeveloped red blood cells that are larger than normal. the medical term for this is “megaloblastic anaemia”.a vitamin b12 or folate deficiency can be the result of a variety of problems, some of which are described below.pernicious anaemia is the most common cause of vitamin b12 deficiency in the uk.pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition that affects your stomach. an autoimmune condition means your immune system (the body’s natural defence system that protects against illness and infection) attacks your body’s healthy cells.in your stomach, vitamin b12 is combined with a protein called intrinsic factor. this mix of vitamin b12 and intrinsic factor is then absorbed into the body in part of the gut called the distal ileum.pernicious anaemia causes your immune system to attack the cells in your stomach that produce the intrinsic factor, which means your body is unable to absorb vitamin b12.the exact cause of pernicious anaemia is unknown, but the condition is more common in women around 60 years of age, people with a family history of the condition and those with another autoimmune condition, such asaddison’s diseaseor vitiligo.some people can develop a vitamin b12 deficiency as a result of not getting enough vitamin b12 from their diet.a diet that includes meat, fish and dairy products usually provides enough vitamin b12, but people who don’t regularly eat these foods – such as those following a vegan diet or who have a generally very poor diet – can become deficient.stores of vitamin b12 in the body can last around two to four years without being replenished, so it can take a long time for any problems to develop after a dietary change.some stomach conditions or stomach operations can prevent the absorption of enough vitamin b12.for example, a gastrectomy (a surgical procedure where part of your stomach is removed) increases your risk of developing a vitamin b12 deficiency.some conditions that affect your intestines can also stop you from absorbing the necessary amount of vitamin b12.for example,crohn’s disease(a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes mean your body doesn’t get enough vitamin b12.some types of medicine can lead to a reduction in the amount of vitamin b12 in your body.for example, proton pump inhibitors (ppis) – a medication sometimes used to treat indigestion – can make a vitamin b12 deficiency worse. ppis inhibit the production of stomach acid, which is needed to release vitamin b12 from the food you eat.your gp will be aware of medicines that can affect your vitamin b12 levels and will monitor you if necessary.some people can experience problems related to a vitamin b12 deficiency, despite appearing to have normal levels of vitamin b12 in their blood.this can occur due to a problem known as functional vitamin b12 deficiency – where there’s a problem with the proteins that help transport vitamin b12 between cells. this results in neurological complications involving the spinal cord.folate dissolves in water, which means your body is unable to store it for long periods of time. your body’s store of folate is usually enough to last four months. this means you need folate in your daily diet to ensure your body has sufficient stores of the vitamin.like vitamin b12 deficiency anaemia, folate deficiency anaemia can develop for a number of reasons. some are described below.good sources of folate include broccoli, brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chickpeas and brown rice. if you don’t regularly eat these types of foods, you may develop a folate deficiency.folate deficiency caused by a lack of dietary folate is more common in people who have a generally unbalanced and unhealthy diet, people who regularly misuse alcohol and people following a fad diet that doesn’t involve eating good sources of folate.sometimes your body may be unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. this is usually due to an underlying condition affecting your digestive system, such ascoeliac disease.you may lose folate from your body if you urinate frequently. this can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of your organs, such as: congestiveheart failure– where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body acute liver damage – often caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol long-termdialysis– where a machine that replicates the kidney function is used to filter waste products from the bloodsome types of medicine reduce the amount of folate in your body, or make the folate harder to absorb.these include some anticonvulsants (medication used to treat epilepsy), colestyramine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate.your gp will be aware of medicines that can affect your folate levels and will monitor you if necessary.your body sometimes requires more folate than normal. this can cause folate deficiency if you can’t meet your body’s demands for the vitamin.your body may need more folate than usual if you: are pregnant (see below) have cancer have a blood disorder – such assickle cell anaemia(an inherited blood disorder which causes red blood cells to develop abnormally) are fighting an infection or health condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling)premature babies (born before the 37th week of pregnancy) are also more likely to develop a folate deficiency, because their developing bodies require higher amounts of folate than normal.if you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant, it’s recommended that you take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day until you’re 12 weeks pregnant. this will ensure that both you and your baby have enough folate and help your baby grow and develop.folic acid tablets are available with a prescription from your gp, or you can buy them over the counter from pharmacies, large supermarkets and health food stores.if you’re pregnant and have another condition that may increase your body’s need for folate, such as those mentioned above, your gp will monitor you closely to prevent you from becoming anaemic.in some cases, you may need a higher dose of folic acid. for example, if you have diabetes, you should take a 5 milligrams (5mg or 5,000 micrograms) supplement of folic acid instead of the standard 0.4 milligrams (0.4mg or 400 micrograms).read more aboutvitamins and minerals in pregnancya diagnosis of vitamin b12 or folate deficiency anaemia can often be made by your gp based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests.different types ofblood testscan be carried out to help identify people with a possible vitamin b12 or folate deficiency. these tests check: whether you have a lower level of haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen) than normal whether your red blood cells are larger than normal the level of vitamin b12 in your blood the level of folate in your bloodhowever, some people can have problems with their normal levels of these vitamins or may have low levels despite having no symptoms. this is why it’s important for your symptoms to be taken into account when a diagnosis is made.a particular drawback of testing vitamin b12 levels is that the current widely-used blood test only measures the total amount of vitamin b12 in your blood.this means it measures forms of vitamin b12 that are “active” and can be used by your body, as well as the “inactive” forms, which can’t. if a significant amount of the vitamin b12 in your blood is “inactive”, a blood test may show that you have normal b12 levels, even though your body can’t use much of it.there are some types of blood test that may help determine if the vitamin b12 in your blood can be used by your body, but these aren’t yet widely available.if your symptoms and blood test results suggest a vitamin b12 or folate deficiency, your gp may arrange further tests. if the cause can be identified, it will help to determine the most appropriate treatment.for example, you may have additional blood tests to check for a condition called pernicious anaemia. this is an autoimmune condition (where your immune system produces antibodies to attack healthy cells), which means you’re unable to absorb vitamin b12 from the food you eat.tests for pernicious anaemia aren’t always conclusive, but they can often give your gp a good idea of whether you have the condition.you may be referred to a specialist for further tests or treatment. this may include: a haematologist (specialist in treating blood conditions) – if you have vitamin b12 or folate deficiency anaemia and your gp is uncertain of the cause, you’re pregnant or symptoms suggest your nervous system has been affected a gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions that affect the digestive system) – if your gp suspects you don’t have enough vitamin b12 or folate because your digestive system isn’t absorbing it properly a dietitian (specialist in nutrition) – if your gp suspects you have a vitamin b12 or folate deficiency caused by a poor dieta dietitian can devise a personalised eating plan for you to increase the amount of vitamin b12 or folate in your diet.the treatment for vitamin b12 or folate deficiency anaemia depends on what’s causing the condition. most people can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins.vitamin b12 deficiency anaemia is usually treated with injections of vitamin b12, in a form called hydroxocobalamin.at first, you’ll have these injections every other day for two weeks, or until your symptoms have stopped improving. your gp or nurse will give the injections.after this initial period, your treatment will depend on whether the cause of your vitamin b12 deficiency is related to your diet. the most common cause of vitamin b12 deficiency in the uk is pernicious anaemia, which isn’t related to your diet.read more about thecauses of vitamin b12 or folate deficiencyif your vitamin b12 deficiency is caused by a lack of the vitamin in your diet, you may be prescribed vitamin b12 tablets to take every day between meals. alternatively, you may need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin twice a year.people who find it difficult to get enough vitamin b12 in their diets, such as those following a vegan diet, may need vitamin b12 tablets for life.although it’s less common, people with vitamin b12 deficiency caused by a prolonged poor diet may be advised to stop taking the tablets once their vitamin b12 levels have returned to normal and their diet has improved.good sources of vitamin b12 include: meat salmon and cod milk and other dairy products eggsif you’re a vegetarian and vegan, or are looking for alternatives to meat and dairy products, there are other foods that contain vitamin b12, such as yeast extract (including marmite), as well as some fortified breakfast cereals and soy products.check the nutrition labels while food shopping to see how much vitamin b12 different foods contain.if your vitamin b12 deficiency isn’t caused by a lack of vitamin b12 in your diet, you’ll usually need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin every three months for the rest of your life.if you’ve had neurological symptoms (symptoms that affect your nervous system, such as numbness or tingling in your hands and feet) caused by a vitamin b12 deficiency, you’ll be referred to a haematologist, and you may need to have injections every two months. your haematologist will advise on how long you need to keep taking the injections.for injections of vitamin b12 given in the uk, hydroxocobalamin is preferred to an alternative called cyanocobalamin. this is because hydroxocobalamin stays in the body for longer.if you need regular injections of vitamin b12, cyanocobalamin would need to be given once a month, whereas hydroxocobalamin can be given every three months.cyanocobalamin injections aren’t routinely available on the nhs. however, if you need replacement tablets of vitamin b12, these will be cyanocobalamin.to treat folate deficiency anaemia, your gp will usually prescribe daily folic acid tablets to build up your folate levels. they may also give you dietary advice so you can increase your folate intake.good sources of folate include: broccoli brussels sprouts asparagus peas chickpeas brown ricemost people need to take folic acid tablets for about four months. however, if the underlying cause of your folate deficiency anaemia continues, you may have to take folic acid tablets for longer – possibly for life.before you start taking folic acid, your gp will check your vitamin b12 levels to make sure they’re normal. this is because folic acid treatment can sometimes improve your symptoms so much that it masks an underlying vitamin b12 deficiency.if a vitamin b12 deficiency isn’t detected and treated, it could affect your nervous system.to ensure your treatment is working, you may need to have furtherblood tests.a blood test is often carried out around 10-14 days after starting treatment to assess whether treatment is working. this is to check your haemoglobin level and the number of the immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in your blood.another blood test may also be carried out after approximately eight weeks to confirm your treatment has been successful.if you’ve been taking folic acid tablets, you may be tested again once the treatment has finished (usually after four months).most people who have had a vitamin b12 or folate deficiency won’t need further monitoring unless their symptoms return, or their treatment is ineffective. if your gp feels it’s necessary, you may have to return for an annual blood test to see whether your condition has returned.as most cases of vitamin b12 deficiency or folate deficiency can be easily and effectively treated, complications are rare.however, complications can occasionally develop, particularly if you’ve been deficient in either vitamin for some time.all types of anaemia, regardless of the cause, can lead to heart and lung complications as the heart struggles to pump oxygen to the vital organs.adults with severe anaemia are at risk of developing: an abnormally fast heart beat (tachycardia) heart failure– where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressurea lack of vitamin b12 (with or without anaemia) can cause the following complications:a lack of vitamin b12 can cause neurological problems (issues affecting your nervous system), such as: vision problems memory loss pins and needles (paraesthesia) loss of physical coordination (ataxia), which can affect your whole body and cause difficulty speaking or walking damage to parts of the nervous system (peripheral neuropathy), particularly in the legsif neurological problems do develop, they may be irreversible.vitamin b12 deficiency can sometimes lead to temporary infertility (an inability to conceive). this usually improves with appropriate vitamin b12 treatment.if you have a vitamin b12 deficiency caused by pernicious anaemia (a condition where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach), your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased.if you’re pregnant, not having enough vitamin b12 can increase the risk of your baby developing a serious birth defect known as a neural tube defect. the neural tube is a narrow channel that eventually forms the brain and spinal cord.examples of neural tube defects include: spina bifida – where the baby’s spine doesn’t develop properly anencephaly – where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull encephalocele – where a membrane or skin-covered sac containing part of the brain pushes out of a hole in the skulla lack of folate (with or without anaemia) can also cause complications, some of which are outlined below.as with a lack of vitamin b12, a folate deficiency can also affect your fertility. however, this is only temporary and can usually be reversed with folate supplements.research has shown a lack of folate in your body may increase your risk ofcardiovascular disease (cvd).cvd is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such ascoronary heart disease (chd).research has shown that folate deficiency can increase your risk of some cancers, such ascolon cancer.a lack of folate during pregnancy may increase the risk of the baby being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) or having a low birthweight.the risk of placental abruption may also be increased. this is a serious condition where the placenta starts to come away from the inside of the womb wall, causingtummy

       " 'Vulval cancer': 'cancer of the vulva is a rare type of cancer that affects women and anyone with a vulva.the vulva is a woman’s external genitals. it includes the lips surrounding the vagina (labia minora and labia majora), the clitoris (sexual organ that helps reach sexual climax), and the bartholin’s glands (2 small glands each side of the vagina).most of those affected by vulval cancer are older women and anyone with a vulva over the age of 65. the condition is rare in women and anyone with a vulva under 50 who have not yet gone through themenopause.symptoms of vulval cancer can include: a persistent itch in the vulva pain, soreness or tenderness in the vulva raised and thickened patches of skin that can be red, white or dark a lump or wart-like growth on the vulva bleeding from the vulva or blood-stained vaginal discharge between periods an open sore in the vulva a burning pain when passing urine a mole on the vulva that changes shape or colourspeak to your gp if you notice any changes in the usual appearance of your vulva. while it’s highly unlikely to be the result of cancer, these changes should be investigated.read more aboutdiagnosing vulval cancer.the exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear, but your risk of developing the condition is increased by the following factors: increasing age vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (vin) – where the cells in the vulva are abnormal and at risk of turning cancerous persistent infection with certain versions of the human papilloma virus (hpv) skin conditions affecting the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus smokingyou may be able to reduce your risk of vulval cancer by stopping smoking and taking steps to reduce the chances of picking up an hpv infection.read more about thecauses of vulval cancer.the main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells.some people may also haveradiotherapy(where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells) orchemotherapy(where medication is used to kill cancer cells), or both.radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you’re not well enough to have an operation, or if the cancer has spread and it isn’t possible to remove it all.read more abouttreating vulval cancer.it’s not thought to be possible to prevent vulval cancer completely, but you may be able to reduce your risk by: practising safer sex – using a condom during sex can offer some protection against hpv attendingcervical screeningappointments – cervical screening can detect hpv and pre-cancerous conditions such as vin stopping smokingthehpv vaccinationmay also reduce your chances of developing vulval cancer. this is offered to all girls who are 12 to 13 years old as part of their routine childhood immunisation programme.cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. this produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.the exact reason why this happens in cases of vulval cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.these include: increasing age vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (vin) human papilloma virus (hpv) infection skin conditions that can affect the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus smokingthe risk of developing vulval cancer increases as you get older. most cases develop in women and anyone with a vulva aged 65 or over. very occasionally women and anyone with a vulva under 50 can be affected.vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (vin) is a pre-cancerous condition. this means there are changes to certain cells in the vulva that aren’t cancerous, but could potentially turn into cancer at a later date. this is a gradual process that usually takes well over 10 years.in some cases, the abnormal cells may go away by themselves. however, because of the risk of cancer, treatment to remove the affected cells is often recommended.symptoms of vin are similar to those of vulval cancer, and include persistent itchiness of the vulva and raised discoloured patches. speak to your gp if you have these symptoms.there are 2 types of vin: usual or undifferentiated vin – this usually affects women and anyone with a vulva under 50 and is thought to be caused by an hpv infection differentiated vin (dvin) – this is a rarer type, usually affecting women and anyone with a vulva over 60, associated with skin conditions that affect the vulvahuman papilloma virus (hpv) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. it’s spread during sex, including anal and oral sex.there are many different types of hpv, and most people are infected with the virus at some time during their lives. in most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn’t lead to further problems.however, hpv is present in at least 40% of people with vulval cancer, which suggests it may increase your risk of developing the condition. hpv is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead tocervical cancer. it’s thought the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vulva, which is known as vin.several skin conditions can affect the vulva. in a small number of cases these are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer.two of the main conditions associated with vulval cancer are lichen sclerosus andlichen planus. both of these conditions cause the vulva to become itchy, sore and discoloured.it’s estimated that less than 5% of those who develop one of these conditions will go on to develop vulval cancer. it’s not clear whether treating these conditions reduces this risk.smoking increases your risk of developing vin and vulval cancer. this may be because smoking makes the immune system less effective, and less able to clear the hpv virus from your body and more vulnerable to the effects of the virus.speak to your gp if you notice any changes in the normal appearance of your vulva.your gp will ask you about your symptoms, look at your medical history, and examine your vulva to look for any lumps or unusual areas of skin.if you would prefer to be examined by a female doctor or you would like a nurse present during the examination, it may help to let your gp practice know in advance of your appointment.if your gp feels some further tests are necessary, they will refer you to a hospital specialist called a gynaecologist. a gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system.the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) recommends that gps consider referring a woman who has an unexplained vulval lump or ulcer, or unexplained bleeding.the gynaecologist will ask about your symptoms and examine your vulva again, and they may recommend a test called a biopsy to determine whether you do have cancer.abiopsyis where a small sample of tissue is removed so it can be examined under a microscope to see if the cells are cancerous.this is often done after alocal anaesthetichas been given to numb the area, which means the procedure shouldn’t be painful and you can go home the same day. occasionally, it may be done undergeneral anaesthetic(where you’re asleep), which may require an overnight stay in hospital.your doctor may put a few stitches in the area where the biopsy was taken from. you may have slight bleeding and soreness for a few days afterwards.your doctor will usually see you 7 to 10 days later to discuss the results with you.if the results of the biopsy show cancer, you may need further tests to assess how widespread it is.these may include: a colposcopy – a procedure where a microscope is used to check for abnormal cells in the vagina a cystoscopy – an examination of the inside of the bladder using a thin, hollow tube inserted into the bladder a proctoscopy – an examination of the inside of the rectum biopsies of the lymph nodes near your vulva to check whether cancer has spread through your lymphatic system acomputerised tomography (ct) scanormagnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan– scans to check for signs of cancer in your lymph nodes or other organs anx-rayto check that cancer has not spread to your lungsthe results of these tests will allow your doctor to ‘stage’ your cancer. this means using a number system to indicate how far the cancer has spread.vulval cancers are staged using a number from 1 to 4. the lower the stage, the less the cancer has spread and the greater the chance of treatment being successful.the staging system for vulval cancer is: stage 1 – the cancer is confined to the vulva stage 2 – the cancer has spread to other nearby parts of the body, such as the lower vagina, anus or lower urethra (the tube urine passes through out of the body), but the lymph nodes are unaffected stage 3 – the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes stage 4 – the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, including more distant lymph nodesstage 1 and 2 vulval cancers are generally regarded as early-stage cancers with a relatively good chance of being treated successfully. stage 3 and 4 cancers are usually regarded as advanced-stage cancers and a complete cure for these types of cancers may not always be possible.treatment for vulval cancer depends on factors such as how far the cancer has spread, your general health, and personal wishes.the main options are surgery,radiotherapyandchemotherapy. many women and anyone with a vulva with vulval cancer have a combination of these treatments.if your cancer is at an early stage, it’s often possible to get rid of it completely. however, this may not be possible if the cancer has spread.even after successful treatment, there is up to a 1 in 3 chance of the cancer returning at some point later on, so you’ll need regular follow-up appointments to check for this.most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (mdts) to treat vulval cancer. mdts are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.members of your mdt will probably include a specialist surgeon, a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer (clinical oncologist) and a specialist cancer nurse.deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. for example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.in most cases, your treatment plan will involve some form of surgery. the type of surgery will depend on the stage of the cancer.there are 3 surgical options to treat vulval cancer: radical wide local excision – the cancerous tissue from your vulva is removed, as a well as a margin of healthy tissue, usually at least 1cm wide, as a precaution radical partial vulvectomy – a larger section of your vulva is removed, such as 1 or both of the labia and the clitoris radical vulvectomy – the whole vulva is removed, including the inner and outer labia, and possibly the clitoristhe time it will take you to recover from surgery will depend on the type of surgery and how extensive it was. for extensive operations, such as a pelvic exenteration, it may be many weeks or months before you start to feel better.your surgeon will talk to you about the possible risks associated with the type of procedure you’re having. possible risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, altered sensation in your vulva, and problems having sex.an additional operation may also be required to assess whether the cancerous cells have spread into one or more lymph nodes in your groin, and remove these if they’re found to contain cancer.if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, it’s sometimes possible to only remove certain lymph nodes, known as sentinel nodes.sentinel nodes are identified by injecting a dye at the site of the tumour and studying its flow to locate the nodes closest to the tumour. these are then removed and checked for cancerous cells.in some cases, some or all of the nodes in your groin may need to be surgically removed. this is called a groin or inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. further treatment with radiotherapy may also be recommended.removing cancerous lymph nodes reduces the risk of the cancer returning, but it can make you more vulnerable to infection and cause swelling in your legs from a build-up of lymphatic fluid(lymphoedema).in cases of advanced vulval cancer or where the cancer returns after previous treatment, an operation called a pelvic exenteration may be recommended. this involves removing your entire vulva as well as your bladder, womb and part of your bowel. this is a major operation and isn’t carried out very often these days.if a section of your bowel is removed, it will be necessary for your surgeon to divert your bowel through an opening made in your tummy (a stoma). stools then pass along this piece of bowel and into a bag you wear over the stoma. this is known as acolostomy.if your bladder is removed, urine can be passed out of your body into a pouch via a stoma. this is known as a urostomy. alternatively, it may be possible to create a new bladder by removing a section of your bowel and using it to create a pouch to store urine in.if only a small amount of tissue has been removed during surgery, the skin of the vulva can often be neatly stitched together.otherwise, it may be necessary to reconstruct the vulva using a skin graft, where a piece of skin is taken from your thigh or tummy and moved to the wound in your vulva. another option is to have a skin flap, where an area of skin near the vulva is used to create a flap and cover the wound.these reconstructive procedures are usually carried out at the same time as the operation to remove the cancer.radiotherapyinvolves using high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. there are several ways it can be used to treat vulval cancer: before surgery to try to shrink a large cancer – this is to help make the operation possible without removing nearby organs after surgery to destroy any cancerous cells that may be left – for example, for cases where cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes in the groin as an alternative to surgery, if you’re not well enough to have an operation to relieve symptoms in cases where a complete cure is not possible – this is known as palliative radiotherapyin most cases, you’ll have external radiotherapy, where a machine directs beams of radiation on to the section of the body that contains the cancer.this is normally given in daily sessions, 5 days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes. the whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.while radiation is effective in killing cancerous cells, it can also damage healthy tissues. this can lead to a number of side effects, such as: sore skin around the vulva area diarrhoea feeling tired all the time loss of pubic hair, which may be permanent swelling of the vulva narrowing of your vagina, which can make sex difficult inflammation of your bladder(cystitis)in younger people, external radiotherapy can sometimes trigger anearly menopause. this means they will no longer be able to have any children.read more about theside effects of radiotherapy.chemotherapyis where medication is used to kill cancer cells. it’s usually given by injection.it’s usually used if vulval cancer comes back or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible. sometimes it may be combined with radiotherapy.the medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue, as well as the cancerous tissue. side effects are common and include: tiredness feeling and being sick hair thinning or hair loss sore mouth andmouth ulcers an increased risk of infections – tell your care team if you develop any symptoms of an infection, and try to avoid close contact with people known to have an infectionthese side effects should pass once treatment has finished.read more about theside effects of chemotherapy.the emotional impact of living with vulval cancer can be significant. many people report experiencing a kind of rollercoaster effect. you may feel down at receiving a diagnosis, feel up when the cancer has been removed from your body, and then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of surgery.some people experience feelings ofdepression. if you think you may be depressed, contact your gp or care team for advice. there are a range of treatments that can help.you may also find it

       " 'Wilms’ tumour': 'wilms’ tumour is a type of kidney cancer in children. it most often affects children under the age of 5.more children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. there are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.it is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information. if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.wilms’ tumour is a type of kidney cancer that was named after dr max wilms, who first described it. it’s thought to come from very specialised cells in the embryo known as metanephric blastema. these cells are involved in the development of the child’s kidneys while they are in the womb. the cells usually disappear at birth, but in many children with wilms’ tumour, clusters of primitive kidneys cells, called nephrogenic rests can still be found.the kidneys are a pair of organs found at the back of the abdomen. they clean the blood by removing excess fluids and waste products, which are then converted into urine.in most children, the causes of wilms’ tumour are unknown. very rarely, people who develop wilms’ tumour have other specific conditions which are present at birth (congenital malformations). these include the lack of an iris in the eye (aniridia), abnormalities of the genitals, and a condition where one side of the body is slightly larger than the other (hemihypertrophy).in 1 in 100 people with wilms’ tumour, another family member will also have wilms’ tumour.the most common symptom is a swollen abdomen, which is usually painless. sometimes a parent or carer may feel a lump in the abdomen which can be quite large. occasionally, the tumour may bleed slightly and this can irritate the kidney and may be painful. there may be blood in your child’s urine (pee), or their blood pressure may be raised. the child may also have a high temperature (fever), upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite.a variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a wilms’ tumour.an abdominal ultrasound scan is usually the first thing that is done. this will be followed by anmriand/orct scanof the abdomen and chest. these scans help doctors to identify exactly where the tumour is and whether it has spread beyond the kidney. this is known as staging. urine and blood samples will also be taken to check your child’s kidney function and general health. most children will go on to have abiopsy, where a sample of tissue is taken from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.the stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. knowing the particular type and the stage of the cancer helps doctors decide on the most appropriate treatment.in the case of a wilms’ tumour, the stage is finalised after surgery to remove the tumour. as most wilms’ tumour patients receive chemotherapy before surgery, you may not know the exact stage of your child’s tumour straight away. an exception is that babies under 6 months old usually have surgery straight away.the tumour is only affecting the kidney and has not begun to spread. it can be completely removed with surgery.the tumour has begun to spread beyond the kidney to nearby structures, but it’s still possible to remove it completely with surgery.the tumour has spread beyond the kidney; either because the tumour has burst before (or during) the operation, has spread to lymph glands (nodes), or has not been completely removed by surgery.the tumour has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or liver. tumours in other parts of the body are known as metastases.there are tumours in both kidneys (bilateral wilms’ tumour).if the tumour comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent cancer or relapse.treatment is planned by specialists in children’s tumours and cancers. this is usually based in a children’s oncology unit within a main hospital, but some treatment may be given closer to home.treatment will depend on a number of factors including how the cells appear under the microscope (histology) and the stage of the tumour. treatment may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.all children with wilms’ tumour will have surgery. initially, this may only involve taking a small sample of cells from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. this is called a biopsy and is usually done under a general anaesthetic using a needle inserted through the skin.apart from very young children (under 6 months), most patients will receive chemotherapy before having a bigger operation to remove the entire tumour. the operation usually involves removing the whole of the affected kidney (nephrectomy).after examining the whole tumour under the microscope, wilms’ tumours can be divided into a number of risk groups based on knowledge about how these different types of tumours are likely to behave. the treatment following surgery will depend on these risk groups. the risk groups are known as low, standard (or intermediate), and high.the majority of tumours are in the ‘standard risk’ group. so-called ‘low risk’ tumours require less treatment than standard risk tumours.two types of wilms’ tumour – anaplastic and blastemal – are considered to be ‘higher risk’ than other wilms’ tumours and require more intensive (stronger) chemotherapy.about 5% to 10% of wilms’ tumours have an appearance called anaplasia, which means the cells look very disorganised under a microscope.this group of high-risk tumours cannot be identified by looking at the biopsy because they occur when a particular type of early kidney cell survives the pre-surgery chemotherapy. these cells are known as blastemal cells. tumours, where most of these cells survive chemotherapy, are called blastemal tumours.other, less common types of kidney tumours may occur in children. these are usually only recognised after surgery to obtain a tumour sample. ‘clear cell sarcoma’ and ‘malignant rhabdoid tumour’ of the kidney are 2 types of cancerous tumour, with their own treatment recommendations.congenital mesoblastic nephroma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumour that occurs in very young children. this type of tumour usually only needs surgery and no other treatment.chemotherapyis the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. it’s usually given as an injection or drip into a vein (intravenously). chemotherapy given before surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.what doctors find out about the tumour after surgery – for example, how the cells look under the microscope and how far the cancer has spread – helps them to decide whether additional chemotherapy should be given (adjuvant chemotherapy). this is to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). this chemotherapy may be given as inpatient or outpatient depending on tumour staging and risk group.radiotherapytreats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.not all children with wilms’ tumour need radiotherapy. for those that do, the area to be treated depends on the stage of the tumour at diagnosis. some children receive radiotherapy to the area around the affected kidney or, less commonly, to the whole abdomen. if the tumour has spread to the lungs, then lung radiotherapy may be needed but this depends on how well the cancer responds to initial chemotherapy; it’s not always needed.radiotherapy may occasionally be used to shrink tumours that are too large to remove surgically. this will, ideally, allow an operation to be done. radiotherapy can also be used when tumours have spread elsewhere in the body.in about 1 in 20 cases, wilms’ tumour affects both kidneys. treatment usually involves surgery to both. the aim of the treatment is to remove as much of the cancer as possible, while leaving as much healthy kidney as possible. chemotherapy is always given. sometimes radiotherapy is needed as well.treatment for wilms’ tumour often causes side effects. your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. many side effects are expected and managed effectively. side effects can include feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting), hair loss, bruising and bleeding, tiredness, diarrhoea, and an increased risk of infection. less common effects may include impact on the heart, kidneys, and liver.a small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. these include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart and lungs work, and a slight increase in their risk of developing another cancer in later life. infertility is a possible late side effect, although this is rare.your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects. these will depend on the exact treatments given.many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness. the trial may include comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. it may just involve collecting patient and tumour details including response to treatment to increase specialists’ knowledge. if appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. written information will be provided to help explain things.taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you will be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. this may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. in these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. thechildren’s cancer and leukaemia group(cclg) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.most children with wilms’ tumour are cured. if the cancer comes back, it’s usually within the first 2 years. when one kidney is removed, the other will be able to work normally and can take over the work of the other kidney.very few children have long-term kidney problems. your child will have regular check-ups to look for any recurrence or problems following treatment.if you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.as a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. you may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. these are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. it’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. however, the cclg bookletchildren & young people’s cancer; a parent’s guidetalks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. the parent’s guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.',\n",
       " 'Womb (uterus) cancer': 'cancer of the womb (uterus) is a common cancer that affects the female reproductive system. it’s also called uterine cancer and endometrial cancer.abnormal vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom of womb cancer.if you have been through themenopause, any vaginal bleeding is considered abnormal. if you have not yet been through the menopause, unusual bleeding may include bleeding between your periods.you should speak to your gp as soon as possible if you experience any unusual vaginal bleeding. while it’s unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it’s best to be sure.your gp will examine you and ask about your symptoms. they will refer you to a specialist for further tests if they suspect you may have a serious problem, or if they are unsure about a diagnosis.read more about thesymptoms of womb canceranddiagnosing womb cancerthe vast majority of womb cancers begin in the cells that make up the lining of the womb (called the endometrium), which is why cancer of the womb is often called endometrial cancer.in rare cases, womb cancer can start in the muscles surrounding the womb. this type of cancer is called uterine sarcoma and may be treated in a different way from endometrial cancer.this article uses the term womb cancer, and mostly includes information about endometrial cancer. read moreinformation about soft tissue sarcomas.womb cancer is separate from other cancers of the female reproductive system, such asovarian cancerandcervical cancer.it’s not clear exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition.a hormone imbalance is one of the most important risks for womb cancer. specifically, your risk is increased if you have high levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body.a number of things can cause this hormone imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, andhormone replacement therapy (hrt). there is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen.it’s not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. this includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types ofcontraception.read more about thecauses of womb cancerthe most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy).a hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but you will no longer be able to get pregnant. surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.radiotherapyorchemotherapyare also sometimes used, often in conjunction with surgery.a type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children.even if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small, treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life.read more abouttreating womb cancerliving with cancer is challenging and womb cancer can affect your life in specific ways.for example, your sex life may be affected if you have a hysterectomy. you may find it physically more difficult to have sex and have a reduced sex drive.you may find it beneficial to talk to other people about your condition, including family members, your partner, or other people with womb cancer.read more aboutliving with womb cancerwomb cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer of the female reproductive system. it’s the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in women afterbreast cancer,lung cancer, andcancer of the colon and rectum.womb cancer is more common in women and anyone with a womb who has been through the menopause. most cases are diagnosed in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74.the most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don’t have cancer.bleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. most women and anyone with a womb diagnosed with womb cancer have been through themenopause, so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual.in women and anyone with a womb who hasn’t been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of: periods that are heavier than usual vaginal bleeding in between normal periodsless common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex.if womb cancer reaches a more advanced stage, it may cause additional symptoms. these include: pain in the back, legs, or pelvis loss of appetite tiredness nauseaif you have postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, or notice a change in the normal pattern of your period, visit your gp.only 1 in 10 cases of unusual vaginal bleeding after the menopause are caused by womb cancer, so it’s unlikely your symptoms will be caused by this condition.however, if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, it’s important to get the cause of your symptoms investigated. the bleeding may be the result of a number of other potentially serious health conditions, such as: endometriosis– where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb fibroids– non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus polyps in the womb liningother types of gynaecological cancer can also cause unusual vaginal bleeding, particularlycervical cancer.read further information: cancer research uk:womb cancer symptoms macmillan:symptoms of womb cancerit’s not known exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing it.cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the dna in cells, which can affect how they grow. this means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.if left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.a number of things have been identified that increase the risk of developing womb cancer.the risk of developing womb cancer increases with age. the majority of cases occur in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74.the risk of developing womb cancer is linked to the body’s exposure to oestrogen. oestrogen is one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system. oestrogen stimulates the release of eggs from your ovaries and causes the cells of the womb lining to divide progesterone gets the lining of your uterus ready to receive the egg from the ovariesthe levels of oestrogen and progesterone in your body are usually balanced with each other. if oestrogen isn’t kept in balance by progesterone, the level in the body can increase. this is called unopposed oestrogen.after themenopause, the body stops producing progesterone. however, there are still small amounts of oestrogen being produced. this unopposed oestrogen causes the cells of the endometrium to divide, which can increase the risk of womb cancer.because of the link between increased levels of unopposed oestrogen and womb cancer, oestrogen-onlyhormone replacement therapy (hrt)should only be given to those who have had their womb surgically removed (hysterectomy).in all other cases, both oestrogen and progesterone (combination hrt) must be used in hrt to reduce the risk of womb cancer.as oestrogen can be produced in fatty tissue, being overweight or obese increases the level of oestrogen in your body. this significantly increases your chances of developing womb cancer.women and anyone with a womb who is overweight is 3 times more likely to develop womb cancer compared with those who are a healthy weight.one way to assess whether your weight is healthy is to understandyour healthy body mass index (bmi).women and anyone with a womb who has not had children are at a higher risk of womb cancer. this may be because the increased levels of progesterone and decreased levels of oestrogen that occur during pregnancy have a protective effect on the lining of the womb.women and anyone with a womb who are treated with tamoxifen (a hormone treatment forbreast cancer) can be at an increased risk of developing womb cancer. however, this risk is outweighed by the benefits that tamoxifen provides in preventing breast cancer.it’s important to visit your gp if you’re taking tamoxifen and experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding.women and anyone with a womb withdiabetesare twice as likely to develop womb cancer as those without the condition.diabetes causes an increase in the amount of insulin in your body, which in turn can raise your oestrogen levels.many women and anyone with ovaries with type 2 diabetes are also overweight, which further increases the risk.women and anyone with ovaries with polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) are at a higher risk of developing womb cancer, as they have high levels of oestrogen in their bodies.pcos can cause symptoms such as irregular or light periods, or no periods at all, as well as problems getting pregnant, weight gain, acne, and excessive hair growth (hirsutism).endometrial hyperplasia is when the lining of the womb becomes thicker. it may be increase risk of developing womb cancer.read further information: cancer research uk:womb cancer risks and causes macmillan:causes of womb canceryou should visit your gp if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. while it’s unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it’s best to be sure.your gp will probably carry out a physical examination of your pelvic area, including your vagina, womb, ovaries, and bladder. they will ask about your symptoms, when they happen, and how often.you may be referred to a specialist in conditions of the female reproductive organs (a gynaecologist) for further tests.in 2015, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) published guidelines to help gps recognise the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. to find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected endometrial cancer, read the nice 2015 guidelines onsuspected cancer: recognition and referral.another test you may have is called a transvaginal ultrasound (tvu). tvu is a type ofultrasound scanthat uses a small scanner in the form of a probe.this is placed directly into the vagina to obtain a detailed picture of the inside of the uterus. the probe can feel a little uncomfortable, but shouldn’t be painful.the tvu checks whether there are any changes to the thickness of the lining of your uterus that could be caused by the presence of cancerous cells.if the results of the tvu detect changes in the thickness of the lining of the uterus, you will usually have abiopsyto confirm the diagnosis.in a biopsy, a small sample of cells is taken from the lining of the womb (the endometrium). the sample is then checked at a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.the biopsy can be carried out in several ways, including: aspiration biopsy – a small flexible tube is inserted into your vagina and up into your womb, and then sucks up a small sample of cells hysteroscopy – this allows the doctor to look at the inside of the womb using a thin type of telescope called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through your vagina and into your womb, allowing the doctor to look at the lining of the womb and take a sample from itin some cases, ahysteroscopymay be used before dilatation and curettage (d&c). d&c is a minor surgical procedure carried out undergeneral anaesthetic, where some tissue from the womb lining is removed. the tissue is then sent off to a laboratory for further testing.ablood testcan sometimes help diagnose womb cancer. this is because some cancerous tumours release certain chemicals into your blood, known as tumour markers, which can be detected during a blood test.however, this type of test isn’t very reliable. the presence of these chemicals doesn’t mean you definitely have womb cancer. some people with womb cancer don’t have these chemicals in their blood.read further information: cancer research uk:womb cancer tests macmillan:how womb cancer is diagnosedif you’re diagnosed with womb cancer, you may have further tests to help determine the stage of the cancer. staging the cancer will allow the doctors to work out how large the cancer is, whether or not it has spread, and the best treatment options for you.these tests may include: a chestx-ray– where radiation is used to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs magnetic resonance imaging (mri)– where magnetic fields are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body to check if the cancer has spread acomputerised tomography (ct) scan– where a series of x-rays are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body to check if the cancer has spread further blood tests – these are usually done to check your general health and how well some of your organs are functioningread treating womb cancerfor more information about staging.health professionals use a staging system to describe how far womb cancer has advanced. these stages are: stage 1 – the cancer is still contained inside the womb (uterus) stage 2 – the cancer has spread to the neck of the womb (the cervix) stage 3 – the cancer has spread outside the womb into nearby tissues in the pelvis or the lymph nodes stage 4 – the cancer has spread to the soft tissues of the abdomen, or into other organs, such as the bladder, bowel, liver, or lungsyour chances of surviving womb cancer depend on the stage at which it’s diagnosed.read further information: cancer research uk:stages of womb cancer cancer research uk:statistics and outlook for womb cancerthe main treatment for womb cancer is to remove the womb (hysterectomy), together with the ovaries and fallopian tubes. this is sometimes followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy to try to kill any possible remaining cancer cells, depending on the stage and grade of the cancer.having a hysterectomy means you will no longer be able to get pregnant. younger women who haven’t already reached themenopausemay not want to have their womb and ovaries removed if they wish to have children.in this case, under very specific circumstances it may be possible to treat the cancer using hormone therapy.advanced womb cancer requires a different course of treatment, usually depending more on chemotherapy.advanced cancer may not be curable, but the treatment aims to achieve a remission, where the cancer shrinks, making you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full.even if there’s no chance of a cure, surgery may be carried out to remove as much of the cancer as possible.radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy can reduce symptoms such as pain by shrinking the cancer or slowing its growth.read further information: cancer research uk:controlling symptoms of advanced womb cancer cancer research uk:which treatment for womb cancer?if you have stage 1 cancer, you’ll probably have a hysterectomy. this involves removing both ovaries and the fallopian tubes in a procedure called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (bso), as well as the uterus (hysterectomy).the surgeon may also take samples from the lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen and other nearby tissue. these will be sent to the laboratory to see whether the cancer has spread.the most common hysterectomy technique involves using one large cut across your tummy to access the womb and remove it.it’s sometimes possible to use a technique called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, also known as a keyhole hysterectomy. this involves using several small cuts so a special type of telescope (laparoscope) and other surgical instruments can be used.this means the surgeon can see inside your body and remove your womb through your vagina with little scarring.you’ll probably be ready to go home 3 to 5 days after your operation, or less if you had keyhole surgery. but it can take many weeks to recover fully.after your operation, you’ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. this is very important, and even if you have to stay in bed you’ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots. you’ll be shown exercises by the nurses or physiotherapist to help prevent complications.when you go home, you’ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. discuss with your doctor or physiotherapist which types of exercise would be suitable for you.if you have stage 2 or 3 womb cancer and the cancer has spread to the cervix or nearby lymph nodes in the pelvis, you may have a radical or total hysterectomy.this involves the additional removal of the cervix and the top of your vagina, as well as the removal of the pelvic lymph nodes. you may also need radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment after surgery to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.if you have advanced womb cancer, you may have surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. this is called debulking surgery.this won’t cure the cancer, but it may ease some of the symptoms. your doctor will discuss whether debulking surgery is suitable for you.read further information: cancer research uk:having your operation for womb cancer national institute for health and care excellence (nice):laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancera course ofradiotherapywill be recommended if your treatment team thinks there’s a significant risk the cancer could return in the pelvis. radiotherapy may also be used to slow the spread of cancer when a surgical cure is not possible.there are 2 types of radiotherapy used to treat womb cancer: internal radiotherapy (also known as brachytherapy) – where a plastic tube is inserted inside the uterus and radiation treatment is passed down the tube into the womb external radiotherapy – where a machine is used to deliver pulses of radiation to your pelvisa course of external radiotherapy is usually given to you as an outpatient for 5 days a week with a break at the weekend. the treatment takes a few minutes. the whole course of radiotherapy may last approximately 4 weeks depending on the stage and position of the womb cancer.some women and anyone with a womb have internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) as well as external radiotherapy. during brachytherapy, the device that delivers radiation is placed in your vagina.there are different types of brachytherapy, involving either low, medium, or high dose rates. with low dose rate methods the radiation is delivered more slowly, so the device has to stay inside you for longer. you’ll have to stay in hospital while you have the treatment. your doctor will discuss this with you.radiotherapy has some side effects. skin in the treated area can become red and sore, and hair loss may occur. radiotherapy to the pelvic area can affect the bowel and cause sickness anddiarrhoea.as your course of treatment progresses, you’re likely to get very tired. most of these side effects will go away when your treatment finishes.if you have stage 3 or 4 womb cancer, you may be given a course ofchemotherapy. chemotherapy can be used after surgery to try to prevent the return of the cancer. in cases of advanced cancer, it may be used to slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms.chemotherapy is usually given as an injection into the vein (intravenously). you’ll usually be able to go home the same day you have chemotherapy, but sometimes you may need a short stay in hospital.chemotherapy is usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment being followed by a period of rest to allow the body to recover.side effects of chemotherapy can include: nausea vomiting hair loss fatiguethere is also an increased risk of an infection developing in your bloodstream(sepsis), as your body’s ability to fight infection is reduced by chemotherapy.the side effects should stop once treatment has finished.read further information: cancer

able to drive for between 3 and 8 weeks after the operation.most people need 4 to 12 weeks off work after a hysterectomy. the recovery time will depend on the type of surgery you have, whether or not any problems develop, and what type of work you will return to.some of the treatments for endometrial cancer, particularly radiotherapy, can make you very tired. you may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. don’t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it.after your course of treatment has finished, you’ll probably be invited back for
